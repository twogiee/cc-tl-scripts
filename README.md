# CROSS†CHANNEL VN script

The script of the visual novel CROSS†CHANNEL, developed by FlyingShrine and written by Tanaka Romeo.
The purpose of this project is to gather all of the scripts and translations for this game in one place so they can easily be compared,
warts and all.

One day it would be cool if we ever got a good translation of this game, huh?

Please, just buy the game people. It's 10 bucks on Steam.

## Current scripts

- [EN] Amaterasu Translations (Ixrec) (2009)
  - The one I think the majority of EN readers have read. An incredibly literal and very cozy fan translation, but very rough. Think classic 2000s anime
    sub quality.
- [EN] George Henry Shaft (2013)
  - Fever dream translation. Is generally higher in quality, but also more deliberately wrong. I highly recommend reading the internal notes GHS wrote throughout
    the entire script if you want to see the ramblings of a madman. It's kind of fascinating in its own way.

## Planned for inclusion

- [JP] Original release (2003)
- [JP] Reprint edition (2012)
- [JP] For all people (console release) (2014)
- [JP] FINAL COMPLETE (2014)
- [EN] Steam Edition (Moenovel) (2018) 

## How to Use

Currently it's just a basic bitch extraction of the text. I'm going to have to make a separate script for moenovel's nonsense ;_;

```
python extract_scripts.py
```
