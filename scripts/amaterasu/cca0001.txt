My oldest memory.
Within far-off mists where even the date was vague.
A luxurious private room embodying the dignity of nobles.
Therein was a canopied bed and a European chair.
But I preferred to sit on the floor.
Especially on these days.
I could see the curtain of a black starry night through my window.
My eyes were drawn to the scattered twinkles cut off by the window frame.
I saw my reflection in the glass separating the outside world from the room's interior.
A privileged young noblewoman---
A graceful girl covered in a Western dress.
Who on Earth are you?

[Girl]
"......Taichi."
