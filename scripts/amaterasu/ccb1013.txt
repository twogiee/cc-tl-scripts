I'm writing the manuscript.

[Taichi]
"Hi-hi-hi."
[Taichi]
"Hi-hi-hi-hi-hi!"
[Taichi]
"Hiii--hi-hi-hi-hi-hi!! (I'm crying)"

I can't get my thoughts together!
The tension is now the exact opposite of that first day when I was writing absentmindedly using only my talent.

[Voice]
"......Keiii-kuuunnn......"

Someone was calling me.
I peeked out the window.

[Taichi]
"Mimi-sempai?"

[Misato]
"Good eveniiing."

[Taichi]
"What's wrooong?"

[Misato]
"Where are you?"

[Taichi]
"I'm looking at you from the second floor window."

[Misato]
"It's too dark for me to see."

[Taichi]
"I can see you just fine."

[Misato]
"I wonder why that is..."

[Taichi]
"Dunno."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun must have great night vision."

[Taichi]
"Since I'm a wild animal, my senses are sharp."

[Misato]
"That's kind of cool."

She spoke while flapping her arms.
She's acting awfully young.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, please come in."

[Misato]
"Yeeesss."
[Misato]
"Ah, a candleâ™ª"

[Taichi]
"The atmosphere is really important when writing, Ozeu-san."

[Misato]
"I see..."

She promptly sat down in the seiza position.

[Misato]
"Were you studying up here?"

[Taichi]
"No, just working on the manuscript."

[Misato]
"Aaah."

[Taichi]
"So, with what purpose have you visited this house?"

[Misato]
"Ah, since you help me out so much, I thought I'd treat you to something."

She held up a wrapped object.

[Misato]
"Here's a bentou."

[Taichi]
"Sempai banzai."

[Misato]
"I made enough for two, so why don't we eat together?"

[Taichi]
"I'll get some drinks."
[Taichi]
"Delicious."
[Taichi]
"Sempai's good at this."

[Misato]
"Am I now? I only just started cooking recently......"

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm no gourmet or anything."

[Misato]
"Ah, saying it like that might be cruel......"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, it's delicious. Yes, delicious."
[Taichi]
"It's been cooked really well. Did you use an open fire?"

[Misato]
"Yes. Of course."

[Taichi]
"......somehow, it feels like it's been a while since I ate a bentou like this."

[Misato]
"Is that so?"

[Taichi]
"My......mother...isn't with us."

[Misato]
"Well......"

[Taichi]
"I think I miss her."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

[Taichi]
"Sempai."

Within the soft darkness, we looked at one another.
The candle's delicate flame shone a soft crimson light onto her cheek.
