Mimi-sempai had been sleeping.

[Taichi]
"Hellooo."

[Misato]
"......nnn?"

[Taichi]
"Good morning. It's morning. I'm Taichi."

[Misato]
"Eh?......Ah, it is......"

She idly rose to her feet.
Uhhh, I can see your panties you know.
I got down on one knee.
Like a knight serving an empress (my motives aside).

[Misato]
"Anyway, good morning."

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Sempai."
[Taichi]
"Won't you die from the heat if you sleep here in the middle of the day?"

[Misato]
"Ah, right, that's true. I'll be more careful."

Sempai wiped her glasses with the hem of her skirt.
Oooh.
She's plump.
She's moderately plump.
Sempai is beautiful...

[Misato]
"Fuaaah."

Her skirt fell back into place.
Sempai repositioned her glasses.

[Misato]
"I'm sleepy."

[Taichi]
"It is small summer weather."
//No idea what he means. 〜IX

[Misato]
"I've never heard that term......"

[Taichi]
"Because I made it up."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun seems to have a talent for making things up."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"Why are you crouched down?"

[Taichi]
"The AA-gun of love yearns for the sky. So much so it bends backward to the navel."

[Misato]
"That's awfully uncouth, but rather poetic......"
(TL Note: A twisted navel is another Japanese euphemism for a pervert.)

[Taichi]
"I'm thankful."

[Misato]
"My throat's parched."

Sempai searched through her belongings.
*roll*

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

A bottle of one-cup sake.
//If there's an English term for a bottle with only enough liquid to fill a single cup, we can use that, otherwise I'll prolly end up putting a tl note here. 〜IX
//Not that I'm aware of, no. - Sheeta

[Misato]
*gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*

[Taichi]
"Owa, that's right!"

I stole it from her.

[Misato]
"Ah!......What are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"You mustn't drink sake at school!"

[Misato]
"My aunt's house is a tavern so it's just fine."

[Taichi]
"You mustn't."

[Misato]
"......I know."

She sulked.
//The bgm005.ogg before this line resets the music in a weird way. I think you can remove it. - Raide

[Misato]
"But, there's no need to follow those rules anymore, is there?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

[Misato]
"Isn't that true? With all the people gone, the rules have lost their meaning."
[Misato]
"So, what have I been doing this for......"

She scratched her head.

[Taichi]
"......Sempai."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, why are you here?"

[Taichi]
"I came to see how you were doing."

[Misato]
"......why......now of all times?"

[Taichi]
"Because I love you, Mimi-sempai."
//Time for that Beach sex scene.-Spin

[Misato]
"............that's......not......"

The tip of her nose was red. Was that because of the sake?

[Misato]
"You can't say that so lightly! Words of love are a precious turning point for both men and women!"

I was scolded.

[Taichi]
"Well......but, it was Sempai that guided me out of darkness to a well-lit place."

Unlike someone who did nothing but be next to me.

[Misato]
"That's......all I did was talk to you."

[Taichi]
"Isn't that enough of a trigger?"

[Misato]
"Okay! Okay! No more talking about that."

She flapped her hands.
......so it's hopeless?

[Taichi]
"Our relationship began with the premise of marriage---"

[Misato]
"That's right, could you please write a manuscript!"

She fled.

[Taichi]
"A manuscript?"

[Misato]
"Yes, I'm requesting the creation of a manuscript that's pure and just and bright and energetic for our pilot broadcast."

[Taichi]
"......nnn."

Well, that was the original objective.

[Taichi]
"Sure."

After all, the notebooks comprehensively contain all of the patterns up until now.
There's no need to go out of my way to make new ones.
