I woke up.
Sunlight was penetrating through the window.
I must have been sleeping soundly. I didn't have a single dream.
The time......7 A.M.
I have to go to school.
Kiri was standing in the hallway.

[Taichi]
"Yo!"

[Kiri]
"......Sempai."

Her expression turned wary.
This is what it's like on a Tuesday.
A gaze filled with animosity.
I averted my eyes.
I voiced nothing provocative.
Miki came out.

[Miki]
"Hey, Sempai."
[Miki]
"Thanks for the food yesterday."
[Miki]
"Come on Kiri, you too."

[Kiri]
"......I......"

[Miki]
"Didn't you eat too?"

[Kiri]
"I did, but......but..."

Complications.
Based on pride.

[Taichi]
"That's fine, I'm not the guy who made it."

[Miki]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan."

[Miki]
"Aaah, so she's Sempai's koremon."

She held up her pinky.

[Taichi]
"Not sure if you'd call her a koremon or a *****mon, but she is a convenient monster."
//Since I have no idea what "koremon" actually means (well, I do, but it's not a remotely lexical meaning so there's no English for it) this was the best I could do with the gag. 〜IX
//Supposed to be parody of Doraemon, from a popular decades-old family manga/anime series. - Raide
//I back up Raide. Added another * to the censorship so it's not read as "Pokemon." Consider adding a "D" at the beginning to make it clearer. -Neko

That could've been bad for copyright.

[Taichi]
"And that's why you may enjoy breakfast."

[Miki]
"Eh?......Is that okay?"

[Taichi]
"It is. I don't like sandwiches that much anyway."

[Miki]
"I'm sorry."

[Taichi]
"It must be rough to eat nothing but sweets."

[Miki]
"......yes."

Kiri suddenly cut in.
She told me with a defiant intonation:

[Kiri]
"What is your objective in doing such a thing?"

[Taichi]
"......my objective...exists."

[Kiri]
"And it is?"

[Taichi]
"......I want to...talk with Kiri."

[Kiri]
"With me?"

[Taichi]
"There's a suitable day for talking. Stay in good spirits until then."

[Miki]
"A suitable day?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, just suitable."

I turned my back to them.

[Kiri]
"Ah......"

[Miki]
"Th-thanks for the sandwiches, Sempai!"
//This translation is far too generous. It wasn't overlooked in game -Neko

I just waved my hand to the two of them behind me.
I killed time until midday.
I mustn't make excessive contact, or I'll be struck with an unknown tragedy.
I can't allow the current, proper me with this knowledge and experience to die.
At midday, I came back to school.
They should be eating bentous......right here.
If they aren't eating, I'll come again. Next week.
I'll repeat it any number of times.
And then---

[Taichi]
"......do you have any food?"

[Miki]
"Unfortunately..."

[Taichi]
"What about that bentou......?"

[Miki]
"Kiri made it."

[Taichi]
"Uwa, that's nice..."

[Kiri]
"......there's not enough for Sempai."

She said flatly.

[Taichi]
"Isn't there quite a bit here?"

[Miki]
"There is a lot."

It seems quite clear that there's enough for three.

[Kiri]
"However, for some reason there isn't any for Sempai."

[Taichi]
"......muu..."
[Taichi]
"Then let's barter."

[Miki]
"You mean trade?"

[Taichi]
"Solid and gummy candies. Handmade."

Their eyes changed color.

[Miki]
"Handmade?"

[Taichi]
"Mmm. By Youko-chan though."
[Taichi]
"By the looks of things, these are low in sugar and are good for your looks. The gummies are made from konjac jelly. Zero calories."

Both of them: "Zero calories!?"
........................

[Taichi]
"Yaaay."

Exchange accomplished.

[Miki]
"It has a mother's flavor......"

[Kiri]
"Yes it does."

[Miki]
"It's milk chocolate."

[Kiri]
"It is..."

[Taichi]
"Though that's a stalker's flavor."

[Miki]
"My cheeks......my cheeks are......"

[Kiri]
"Nnnnnnn!"

[Taichi]
"Delicious......Kiri-chin has a talent for cooking."

[Kiri]
"......all I did was heat them up."

[Taichi]
"But they're delicious."

[Kiri]
"If I don't make them, Miki's going to eat sweets forever."

[Miki]
"Buuut..."

[Taichi]
"We both seem to be laboring over food."

[Miki]
"Yes......"

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, let's get married."

[Kiri]
"That's impossible."

[Miki]
"Not, 'I don't want to,' but, 'Impossible.' There you have it, Sempai."

[Taichi]
"......I'm on fire."

[Kiri]
"I'll throw water on you."

[Taichi]
"That would annoy me."

[Miki]
"Are there any more sweets?"

[Taichi]
"There are. Cookies, sables and more. Youko-sensei is good at making sweets."

[Miki]
"Whoa, that's unexpected."

[Taichi]
"They seem to keep well."

[Kiri]
"......is she...your lover?"

[Taichi]
"No, we just lived together once."

[Miki]
"Cohabitation."

[Kiri]
"Cohabitation."

They were stymied.

[Taichi]
"No, not the same as cohabitation."
[Taichi]
"Ummm, basically we had no parents, and Mutsumi-san adopted both of us. Ah, she's my guardian."

I explained efficiently.

[Miki]
"So that's what it was."

[Kiri]
"......I thought they had a suspicious relationship......"

[Miki]
"Hasekura-sempai has many mysteries."

[Taichi]
"I couldn't agree more."
[Taichi]
"Now...I have some special thousand-year candy here, so everyone get in the mood for the seven-five- three festival."

[Miki]
"Waa, thousand year candy!"

Miki smiled.
Kiri promptly took it from me.

[Miki]
"Uuooo, what are you doing!?"

[Kiri]
"You can't have sweets."

[Miki]
"But you ate them yourself!"

[Kiri]
"I eat real food too. From now on we have to manage our own health, right?"

[Miki]
"......okaaay."

[Kiri]
"What is it? You're staring at me with indecent eyes......"

[Taichi]
"No, I was thinking you make a good combo."

[Miki]
"Since we're the flower-chans."

[Taichi]
"So much so that I want to make you debut."

[Miki]
"Though even if we debut now......"

A weak Miki.

[Kiri]
"At best the CD could only sell eight copies."

[Miki]
"A million would be a dream within a dream."

[Kiri]
"Then I'll buy two copies."

[Miki]
"Then I'll also buy two."

[Kiri]
"That makes ten."

[Miki]
"Yep, ten. Two digits."

She chuckled.
They really are intimate.
Their behavior refreshed me just a tiny bit.
Shinkawa Yutaka was staring at the grove of trees.
I moved toward Shinkawa, and called out to him.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

Shinkawa was sweating.
It didn't look like summer sweat.
I stepped back.
A car came.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa!"

I quickly pushed him.
Right behind him, the truck drove slowly by.
Shinkawa didn't react when I spoke to him.
He was shaking.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa?"

[Shinkawa]
"Ah......sorry."

He regained his senses.

[Shinkawa]
"Somehow......when I look into something like a grove of trees......I start feeling horrible......I've been like that for a long time......though I have no idea why......"

He covered his face as he stood up, and looked dizzy for a while.
Then he looked up at the blue sky, and sighed as if panting.
What Shinkawa saw behind the trees...
That was surely---
Wednesday.
To school.
A gate to prevent running away.
It didn't seem to be protecting the students so much as protecting the outside world from us.
That's the impression it held.
I tried looking in the classroom on a whim.
As I feared, Touko wasn't there.

[Taichi]
"Nn......"

My heart was parched.
I held back tears. My ears were ringing.
This wasn't meant to happen.
I don't even know when my heart will burst.
If I fail now, I'll go on another journey of long odds.
Even though I'm returning here, will I repeat this hundreds or thousands of times?
I have no sense for it......I can't endure it.
I left the classroom.
I chased Touko out of my consciousness.
Beginning the third day 『as always.』
But all that did was fill myself with hollowness.
The pool.

[Taichi]
"......"

Okay.
As planned, I'll be chosen.
If there are no abnormalities in either Kiri or Miki's behavior, then their conduct is fixed to a certain degree.
As long as Miki hasn't lived through too much proper time.

[Miki]
"Ei!!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I told you no, nooo!"

[Miki]
"Ahahaha! Kiriii, you're getting weeet."

[Kiri]
"But we're in the water! Ah! My hair's getting wet, it's getting wet!"

[Miki]
"But isn't this a pool!?"

[Kiri]
"It is, but-!"

[Miki]
"Eeei."

[Kiri]
"Aaah, my haiiir..."
[Kiri]
"Payback!!"

[Miki]
"Kyaaa!"

I was watching a happy scene.

[Kiri]
"Yooouuuu!"

[Miki]
"Waaaa!"

[Kiri]
"Take this!!"

[Miki]
"I will not take that."

[Kiri]
"Ah, use of the swim board is prohibited!"

[Miki]
"It's my shield."

[Kiri]
"No fair!"

[Miki]
"It's a handicap since my hair is longer."

[Kiri]
"But, you can only use one hand, so your attack strength has decreased!"

[Miki]
"Wa!?"

[Kiri]
"Time for the hunt!"

[Miki]
"Aaah, kyaaa!?"
//Anyone else wondering why Kiri's lines here tend to be copies and not Miki's? 〜IX

While splashing around, they negotiated with water.
So innocent.
*thump*

[Taichi]
"......!"

My heart leaped.
That innocence of theirs had touched me.
I pushed my heart unconsciously.
It's not like my soul is among my internal organs.
But what I felt had almost physically hit my real heart.
That made me happy.
I thought it was 『lovely』 in my heart.

[Kiri]
"Kyaaa!!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha! You fell over!"

[Kiri]
"I'm soaked......"

[Miki]
"It's a pool, so you have to get wet."

[Kiri]
"......now you've said it."

[Miki]
"......eh? Eeeh?"

[Kiri]
"Now that I'm soaked, I can swim."

[Miki]
"Ah...Ah! Ah! No close quarters combat!"

[Kiri]
"You think the breaststroke can beat the crawl stroke!"

[Miki]
"Shock and awe! Shock and awe!"

[Kiri]
"I'll make you dripping wet!"

[Miki]
"Nooo! My hair turns to seaweed when it gets wet!"

[Kiri]
"I'll make you a seaweed-chan!"

[Miki]
"Wa! Wa! Not good!"

[Kiri]
"Soraaa!"

[Miki]
"Ginyaaaaaaaa!!"

The sound of splitting water.
Unceasing laughter.
It made me think of gentle, soft flowing time.
A scene from a warm world.
I carved it into my heart.
So I wouldn't forget.
So I could remember it in detail.
I watched the two girls play for a very long time.
The first time I met Kiri was around the time of my reunion with Shinkawa.
I'd heard that Shinkawa had a niece, but I never imagined it was Kiri.
An awkward greeting.
A denouncement from Kiri, who still wasn't used to Gunjou Institute.
An awkward silence.
I spoke to Kiri about unadaptive persons.
//Not people? - Raide
//I don't understand this sentence O.o - Sheeta
//I missed the explanation(assuming you gave one to Sheeta) but I'll do this anyway.-Spin
Touching on the contradiction in Kiri's words,
And predicted the future prospects for the girl she'd tried to protect out of that sense of justice.
Then, I asked her a question.

[Taichi]
"It's hard to make friends. But we have to make them. Do you know why?"
[Taichi]
"Because we need them, in order to raise and nurture our hearts."

There's no way we can conform to everyone.
This was merely my supreme truth.
Kiri got to know Miki afterward, and they started coming to the Broadcasting Club as a pair.
My consciousness flew farther, remembering that time in detail.

[Taichi]
"Oooh, you've come."

[Miki]
"Heya."

[Kiri]
"......hello."

They were like two flowers planted in the same garden.

[Taichi]
"Flowers!"

[Misato]
"What's that?"

[Taichi]
"Their stage name. Stage names are required in the Broadcasting Club. Everyone has one."

[Miki]
"Fuaa..."

[Tomoki]
"Again with those lies, ga!"

Somehow, I punched him right around the moment he said 'lies.'

[Taichi]
"Tomoki is 'Immoral,' Sakuraba is 'Mister Vigilante,' and I am 'Love Aristocrat.'"

[Miki]
"Is that true?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed it is!"

[Miki]
"Please show me a conversation with those names."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Immoral, how's your siscon been doing? It's exactly the same as always, right?"

[Misato]
"Shisukon?"

[Tomoki]
"Please stoooop."

I was being strangled.
Tomoki was desperate, since the sister was also here.

[Taichi]
"......I gggh...get it......suggender......suggendr......I'm dying......"

[Sakuraba]
"Only the Love Aristocrat can die from love?"

[Taichi]
"I think I'm going to go 『meet』 my mama in heaven......"

[Misato]
"Hey! Violence gets you suspended."

Mimi-sempai chopped Tomoki's head.

[Tomoki]
"Ah, yeah......"

[Taichi]
"......I thought I'd die."

[Tomoki]
"You reap what you sow."

[Kiri]
"......haa."

Kiri was suddenly tired.

[Taichi]
"What's with that delicate act?"
[Taichi]
"The Broadcasting Club is a nominal sports club, you know?"

[Misato]
"......again with the......"

[Taichi]
"With the third years happily graduated, Sakuraba-sensei had troublesome expectations for you two to come in and fill their shoes."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah."

Sakuraba stood up coolly, and spoke while the finger he'd been pointing with had been beaten down.

[Sakuraba]
"Today, I want to give everyone a lesson on a type of persimmon tree."

[Taichi]
"That's good, Sensei!"

[Misato]
"Your finger is engorged with blood."

[Sakuraba]
"You all know that peanuts are classified as a kind of persimmon tree."

Sakuraba spoke, ignoring us, or perhaps not hearing us.
Miki nodded twice.
She's honest.

[Sakuraba]
"There are a surprising number of people who cannot forgive those peanuts."

[Miki]
"That's true."

[Sakuraba]
"I have always been unable to allow that deception. Why do you think that is?"

[Taichi]
"Ha, because peanuts are classified that way, that means there is a persimmon tree which grows peanuts?"

[Sakuraba]
"That's right. If you don't like it, go eat a pure persimmon tree. Complaints about peanuts because of the peanut persimmon tree only end up denying proper respect to the peanut persimmon tree."
[Sakuraba]
"It's a deception."

[Taichi]
"It is exactly as you say!"

[Sakuraba]
"That is why I only eat peanuts that grow on persimmon trees."

[Taichi]
"......are you an idiot?"

We sobered up.

[Sakuraba]
"Did you understand?"

[Taichi]
"Listen to us!"

[Sakuraba]
"My right ear is hard of hearing."

This was true.
It's no obstacle in his daily life though.

[Taichi]
"It is hard to forgive that power of yours which returned me to my true self."
[Taichi]
"I shall deprive you of the 'ku' in your surname of 'Sakuraba,' leaving you with the name of a queen!"

[Sakuraba]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"From today onward, you are Saraba. Saraba Sakuraba. Good afternoon, Saraba."

Words are fun.

[Sakuraba]
"I understand."

[Tomoki]
"Hey, don't acknowledge that."

[Sakuraba]
"My talk ends here."

He sat down once again, and began curling his fingers to make the stinging go away.

[Misato]
"......these people."

She'd gathered them all.

[Miki]
"I really understand."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Misato]
"You think this will work out?"

[Miki]
"Somehow, it seems fine. Right, Saku-chin?"

[Kiri]
"......Sensei told me to make it work out."

[Misato]
"Well, we won't force you to do anything......if you don't like it you can quit anytime."

[Taichi]
"Ah, nooo......we just got flowers in the workplace."

[Misato]
"......there you have it."

You're going to buy them? They still look like brats, so they might be easily reeled in.

[Taichi]
"You're going to buy them? They still look like brats, so they might be easily reeled in. It's the club-joining-celebration plan."

[Tomoki]
"You're saying your thoughts out loud again, Taichi."

[Miki]
"......"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Nnnn, okay, this."

I pulled out two items from the Taichi Bag.

[Taichi]
"Squad Member Yamanba Miki!"

[Miki]
"Hi, I'm Yamanobe. Yes!"

One of the items was colored paper.

[Taichi]
"This is for you. The big star and cosmetic surgery pro that all the mischievous boys seem to love, Mich**l Jack**n---"

[Miki]
"Is-is that colored autograph paper!?"

[Taichi]
"Whom I, the Love Aristocrat Kurosu Taichi, have looked up to as an idol. I give you my autograph."

I pushed it to her.

[Miki]
"Ayaya."

[Taichi]
"Oyoyo."
[Taichi]
"And, Squad Member Sakura Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"This is for you. The big man in baseball today, Ba** Ruth---"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I present you with this Taichi doll."

[Misato]
"Are those lines even connected?"
[Misato]
"They aren't in the slightest, are they?"

As one could understand from the fact that Sempai wears glasses (?), she's a person of rules.
Disorderly things seem to get on her nerves.

[Tomoki]
"He cut it off because there was no reaction."

[Taichi]
"......now then, Sakura-kun. Feel free to always carry this, rain or shine, and make it your little friend to hold at night when you cry."

[Kiri]
"............"

Since she didn't put her hand out, I hung it around her neck with a string.

[Miki]
"Did you make it yourself?"

[Taichi]
"That is true."

[Sakuraba]
"A miniature."

[Miki]
"For a peanut specialist, what you say is rather granular."

[All Three]
"!!!"

Sakuraba, Tomoki and I looked at each other.
We liked this gag.

[Taichi]
"She passes."

[Tomoki]
"Yes."

[Sakuraba]
"Good."

We gave Miki a thumbs-up.

[Miki]
"Eh......huh, what?"

[Kiri]
"............and..."
[Kiri]
"Huh? It won't come off?"

Kiri was trying to throw away the doll.

[Taichi]
"Waaaiiit!"

[Kiri]
"Mu!"

Her face showed that I'd tricked her successfully.

[Taichi]
"Did you try to throw it away? You tried to throw it away, didn't you?"

I took pride in my win.

[Taichi]
"It's a shame, but 『To throw out the Taichi doll is a terrible thing!』"

[Kiri]
"I don't understand."

[Taichi]
"It's an amazingly important item!"
[Taichi]
"So it's useless to try and throw it away."

[Kiri]
"......it's cursed?"

[Miki]
"Waaa, then this autograph is too!"

Miki tried to throw the autograph out the window.
A voice came from nowhere in particular.
『The Love Aristocrat's Autograph』 cannot be discarded!

[Miki]
"Hayan!!?"

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahaha!"

[Tomoki]
"Are you using magic?"

[Misato]
"Is this how we......aren't we celebrating our new members?"

The doors in front and behind opened simultaneously.

[Shinkawa]
"Heya. Did Kiri come here?"

[Touko]
"Hey, Taichi! Didn't I tell you to wait! Why'd you go ahead on your own!?"

Two simultaneous visitors.

[Misato]
"Ah, welcome."
[Misato]
"Let's bring out some cold tea for our visitors."

To the fridge in a hurry.

[Sakuraba]
"The refrigerator is empty today, club president-sempai."

[Misato]
"Hau!"
[Misato]
"I'll go buy some, so please keep them here!"

[Taichi]
"Roger."

[Touko]
"Ah, that's okay......you don't have to......"

[Misato]
"I do. Absolutely!"

She disappeared down the hallway while flapping her arms.

[Kiri]
"......Yutaka, what did you come here for?"

[Shinkawa]
"I guess I should say something......thank you for looking after part of my family."

[Kiri]
"You shouldn't. Go home."

She tried to push him out.

[Tomoki]
"Is Shinkawa joining the club too?"

[Shinkawa]
"Eh!? I'm in the Baseball Club."

[Miki]
"Did we have a Baseball Club?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's an organization of only three members which plays very hard with three bases."

[Miki]
"......haeee, fuaniiina."

[Taichi]
"This school is quite fuaniina itself."

[Touko]
"Aaah, Taichi! Why did you blow off our promise to......"

[Taichi]
"You can pass items to other people."

[Miki]
"Umm, Kirihara-sempai, I give you this!"

[Touko]
"Eh?"

She received it.

[Touko]
"No, what is this? It won't come off my hand? Eh? Glue?"

Shaking can't remove it.

[Touko]
"Hey, what's going on here!!?"

『The Love Aristocrat's Autograph』 cannot be discarded!
『The Love Aristocrat's Autograph』 cannot be discarded!
『The Love Aristocrat's Autograph』 cannot be discarded!

[Taichi]
"Don't make the 'discarded' comment repeat itself for no reason. System messages are annoying."

[Touko]
"I can't hear those nonsensical messages."

[Taichi]
"You have no choice but to give it to someone."

[Touko]
"Then why don't you take responsibility for this!?"

It cannot be given to Taichi!

[Touko]
"Why not?!"

[Taichi]
"You can't pass it to anyone who isn't a friend."
[Taichi]
"You and I are no different from strangers, so you can't pass it to me."

Touko opened and closed her mouth like a goldfish.

[Touko]
"Wh-wh-what did you say!!?"

[Taichi]
"Give up and become a club member."

[Touko]
"Mokiiiiiiiiiii!!"

[Kiri]
"Just pass it to someone already! That's embarrassing!"

[Shinkawa]
"That's why I was worried about whether this would go well......you aren't that dependable after all......"

[Kiri]
"It'll go well. She just has to pass it."

[Sakuraba]
"Hu, it's awfully lively today."

Sakuraba whispered.

[Tomoki]
"Oh, your fingers are fine now?"

[Sakuraba]
"Thanks to the power of soap and water."

Sempai came tottering back, and put cups on coasters.

[Misato]
"There's no tea, but I've poured water into the teacups!"

[Taichi]
"What's the point!?"

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha."

Laughing and getting angry.
The noise of a small festival.
This is good.
This is how memories should be.

[Taichi]
"Everyone please look! Something horrible has happened!"

Their eyes gathered on me.

[Taichi]
"I'm streaking!!"

I nimbly stripped off my clothes.

[Tomoki]
"You are just...!"

I was kicked off.
I hugged Touko's butt.

[Touko]
"Kiaaaaaaaa!!?"

[Taichi]
"It's a bit shallow. I can touch your pelvis. Get more meaty down here."

[Touko]
"Kieeeeeeee!!!"

Fighting spirit.

[Taichi]
"Gufuuu!!"

I hugged Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Being touched by a boyyyyyyyy!!!"

[Taichi]
"Gyafuuu!!"

[Miki]
"Waaaai!!"

[Taichi]
"Guooo!!?"

[Touko]
"You too, Miyasumi Misato."

[Misato]
"Eh? B-but?"

[Touko]
"You lose if he hits the ground."

Am I a ball?

[Misato]
"Well, that would be bad."
[Misato]
"L-like this?"

[Taichi]
"Seryaaa!!"

[Tomoki]
"You put in a lot of fighting spirit right at the end."

[Sakuraba]
"I saw that as Taichi's special service."

[Miki]
"He's a man!"

That was fun.
Endlessly fun.
A high quality memory.
I definitely don't want to forget this.
I wished that I wouldn't.
That night,
I heard a noise outside.
I blew out the candle,
Moved to the window,
And looked outside.
Kiri was walking down the street in front of my house.
I followed her.
........................
A crossbow---
It definitely wasn't a toy.
Out of everything you could get in this country, it was a weapon of unparalleled strength.
Though it can't fire repeatedly.
It excels in silence, and abounds in destructive power.
Kiri pulled the trigger.
An arrow pierced a rotted tree.
The sound of air moving was left in my ears.
Kiri readied a new arrow.
She finished loading it with the cocking device.
Then aimed.

[Kiri]
"........................"

Her trajectory inclined.
Intentional? Coincidental?
She fired.

[Kiri]
"............"

Kiri exhaled toward her feet and scratched her head roughly.
She seemed frustrated.
She ran to the tree that was her target,
Collected her arrows,
And left.
I tried walking up to that tree.

[Taichi]
"......"

I wonder if I'm doing something unfair.
Kiri thinks of me as a monster.
A monster that eats people's hearts.
Isn't that just like the current me?

[Kiri]
"We had no friends at our previous school. Neither him nor me."
[Kiri]
"Even those who were our friends betrayed us......so we couldn't trust anyone......"
[Kiri]
"Even though we weren't hurting anyone, everyone hurt us."

[Taichi]
"But shooting and killing wild beasts that protect themselves is the way of the world."

[Kiri]
"......are you not a human?"

........................

[Kiri]
"I..."
[Kiri]
"I can't stand how scary the world is."

[Taichi]
"What part of it?"

[Kiri]
"......the malice."
[Kiri]
"Everyone's malice......"

........................

[Kiri]
"......humans, when they pass away, they're gone just like that......because there's hardly anything in the world......"
[Kiri]
"There are so many places with 『nothing there.』 There's hardly ever 『something there!』"
[Kiri]
"We don't know when we'll be swept away......that's what I think."

[Taichi]
"That's......like a sci-fi story about...humanity's annihilation or something?"

[Kiri]
"It's different from that......it's different from things like that, which have reasons......"
[Kiri]
"It's like I've woken up from a dream."
[Kiri]
"Even though it's scary, with nothing but quarreling......"
[Kiri]
"But sometimes I think, if everything suddenly disappeared one day......and if I was left alone......in this petty world......"
[Kiri]
"I......I'd......"

........................

[Taichi]
"Each person has a different form of happiness."

[Kiri]
"......I don't like that."
[Kiri]
"There might not be any malice, but I don't like this."
[Kiri]
"After all......even though there are people here......each one of them is closed off......as if on a solitary island in some distant sea......"
[Kiri]
"I don't like that......"

........................
It's almost as if Kiri...
'Please care about me---'
She looked as if she was screaming that.

[Taichi]
"Uu......"

I woke up.
I'd been dreaming.
A nostalgic dream.
Kiri's speech on malice.
Come to think of it, I don't know how those two were rejected by the world.
Although I can imagine.
In the end, people are living for their own sakes.
Living within various desires while touching other people.
It's ironic.
Quite a bit of time went by.

[Taichi]
"Guess I should get going."

Kiri was there.
She looked around the outside world through the fence.
Deja vu pulled my consciousness away to the distant past.
Summer was starting to end.
The cicadas were remarkably noisy.
Crying voices that seemed to be beating me.
I could tell they were at the end of their lives.
A summer dyed with the dregs of life.
Kiri was on the roof.
Alone.
She'd been crying.
Even from behind, I could tell by the shaking of her shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Kiri......"

[Kiri]
"......Kurosu......sempai?"

She didn't hide her tears.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka......Yutaka, he......fell from here......"

[Taichi]
"Yeah......"

I knew.
There was no one who didn't know.
Not in this city.
In normal society, a student jumping to his death is a rather big topic.
His or her guardians ask the school questions about who was at fault, and try to bring them to light.
The school tries to evade responsibility.
That's not the case at Gunjou.
No one in society will come asking questions, and the school won't run away.
A number of people took responsibility.
Society couldn't care less about the dangerous boys and girls at Gunjou.
Very few were saddened by it.

[Kiri]
"No one......no one......feels sad......no one cares......how any of us feel......how any of us lived!"

She was unusually excitable.
A week had already passed since Yutaka's death.
Kiri's sorrow was belated.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Kiri......was Yutaka happy?"

[Kiri]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"Was he as happy as he could have been?"

An ordinary question.
But,
The meaning was exactly the opposite.

[Kiri]
"......he's always been in pain."

[Taichi]
"Always? Are you sure?"
[Taichi]
"There wasn't even a moment of happiness?"

[Kiri]
"That's......"

Undoubtedly, there was.

[Kiri]
"......after becoming friends with Sempai......he started smiling......"
[Kiri]
"But he wasn't recovering at all!"

Her tone strengthened.

[Kiri]
"He hadn't recovered from even a tiny bit of the pain he received!"

[Taichi]
"Then Kiri-chin thinks there was something lacking in Yutaka's life?"

[Kiri]
"That's not......what I meant......"

[Taichi]
"......I may say that, but sadness isn't a logical thing."

I'd been in doubt too.
About how to deal with Kiri.

[Taichi]
"It's okay to cry."

I looked up at the sky.
The pure white buried my field of vision in the moment before I came to understand that it was a huge cloud.

[Taichi]
"At least before summer ends."

Along with the last moments of the cicadas.
Did Kiri hear in that a meaning which included a thousand emotions?

[Kiri]
"......uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

She shut her eyes, grabbed my shirt sleeve and raised her voice.

[Kiri]
"Yuta-nii......he died......he's dead......"

Sobbing.

[Taichi]
"............"

Yuta-nii.
That was her beloved onii-chan.
He lived well, even with only one leg.
Kiri's parents---
On their faces, which I saw at Yutaka's funeral, there was light relief.
Was Kiri aware of that?
Most likely, she knew all about it.
Even after meeting so many cruel fates, those two continued to support one another.
In a sense, two halves of one body.
Kiri was only a half.
Just like me......
Except, Kiri wished to be that way.
Now, strong emotions deprived her of spirit.
But someday, her sadness will lessen, and she'll search for her other half.
Yutaka and Kiri.
Two people who were of one body and mind.
Kiri had no sins.
But I......my monster...stirred.

[Taichi]
"Kiri......"

I wrapped my hands around her back.
Violent passions made Kiri unable to sense approaching enemies, so she didn't notice.

[Kiri]
"Uuuuu......uaaaa......"

Little by little, her emotions subsided.
By then, I was completely embracing Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Kiri......are you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"You are lonely."

[Kiri]
"......Kurosu-sempai?"

[Taichi]
"I'm very empty."

I looked down at her small features.
Two deep obsidian stones leaked salt water on her face.

[Taichi]
"I think Yutaka was happy. Kiri was there, so he forgot all the bad things."
[Taichi]
"I think he was happy up until his final moments."

I moved my face closer.

[Kiri]
"............eh?"

She became a little confused.
Our faces crossed paths.
I stole her lips.

[Kiri]
"............!!?"

Her four limbs went berserk.
I held her tight.

[Kiri]
"......nna."

Kiri choked.
I pushed her against the fence, and continued sucking her lips.

[Kiri]
"......fua......no......stop......"

Surprise robbed Kiri of the ability to think.
She couldn't resist well.

[Taichi]
"Are you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"Aren't you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"......I don't......know......"

I kissed her.
The second time.
This time I invaded as far as the inside of the gums.
At the same time, I moved one hand inside her skirt.

[Kiri]
"Nn!......Nn, nnnnnnn!!?"

Her resistance suddenly strengthened.
Kiri pushed me away.

[Kiri]
"P-please stop!!!"

[Taichi]
"............"

I think I had a slight smile. I'm sure of it.

[Kiri]
"You are......"

I saw her shock slowly become covered in abhorrence.

[Kiri]
"--!!"

She ran away.
Passing right by me.
A creaking door. A closing door.

[Taichi]
"......haha."

I covered my face with my hands.
I see, this certainly is bad.
The corners of my mouth rose brutally.
Kiri and I became estranged.
She seldom showed up to club after that.
There were times Miki brought her along by force, but she avoided me.
We no longer conversed, and our relationship stopped.
That sort of thing happened---

[Taichi]
"............"

Kiri's prediction happened to come true.
Humans are simple things to destroy.
Now,

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

I spoke softly to her.
Kiri wasn't surprised.
She slowly turned around.

[Kiri]
"......the world has become this......where people have disappeared......"
[Kiri]
"In exchange for the disappearance of malice......there's no longer any substance......"
[Kiri]
"Even so, you didn't change, did you?"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"......I've thought about saying this for a while."
[Kiri]
"Sempai, why are you still alive?"

『Hey, I have a question for you......why won't you go die already?』
//What? Why will not you go die already? -Neko
They overlapped.
The past and present.
Crossing.
As if a knife I'd thrown a long time ago was now being unexpectedly thrown back at me.
An ironic composition.

[Kiri]
"Do you think you have the right to live?"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"You are...black."

I felt that it was an accurate metaphor.

[Kiri]
"You're not a person. You're only something resembling a person. You're imitating a person. Like an insect."
[Kiri]
"You imitate, change into a person and attack people."
[Kiri]
"You are something that hurts people. You are incompatible with them."
[Kiri]
"A long time ago, the reason why your adaptation coefficient surpassed eighty was a mystery. But that's not the slightest bit strange. The part inside you that is a person is literally less than twenty percent."

She spoke loquaciously.
She's covering up the Sakura Kiri persona that she'd kept up until now, instead, constructing a more striking image.
The knife of her words had been trying to pierce my mind.
Until now she's only carried dull blades---
Now it was Sakura Kiri's trump card!

[Kiri]
"A monster."
[Kiri]
"You deceive by not acting completely like a monster, despite being no better than one."
[Kiri]
"Do you think sympathy can sprout between a person and a monster, such that they can live together all friendly and happily? Do you think you can obtain the happiness of a person?"
[Kiri]
"It's impossible."
[Kiri]
"The very little kindness in the world definitely will not be given to you. No, it must not be given to you."
[Kiri]
"It's the same as saying that no person holds love for the parasite that inhabits and eats away at their body. Even if there was, that person would be a lunatic."
[Kiri]
"You're always searching for prey to be sacrificed for your own ends. I understand. Until now that's been suppressed. But now that the world's become this, and people have dwindled, your suppression is no longer working."
[Kiri]
"Because you've lost the need to imitate us."
[Kiri]
"Your eyes always fall on us for the purpose of taking pleasure in hurting us. And without a single thought for us, you're trying to take your time ridiculing us as much as possible."
[Kiri]
"You're not a person, and you're not a monster."
[Kiri]
"So then, what are you? Something like you that isn't anyone or anything should have disappeared from this world. That's what I think."
[Kiri]
"Even the majority of humanity, filled with malice, had value far above that of your life. To me, they did."
[Kiri]
"I will give you two warnings."
[Kiri]
"First, if you're thinking that you can really become human through contacting others, you're mistaken. That's impossible. That thought profanes humans. I've never seen a monster as perfect as Sempai."
[Kiri]
"It is no exaggeration that you are a mentally deranged person. A lunatic among lunatics."
[Kiri]
"......the zenith of people who can go insane."
[Kiri]
"And one more: don't even think about laying your hands on us."
[Kiri]
"If Sempai approaches us, searching for a living sacrifice......"

Kiri drew out her last thrust.

[Kiri]
"I will shoot and kill you."

[Taichi]
"........................"

[Kiri]
"......I will absolutely not hand Miki over to you."
[Kiri]
"I won't let you destroy her!"

Her footsteps passed me in a straight line.
A creaking door. A closing door.
I became alone.

[Taichi]
"......a monster, huh?"

I ruminated on that word, and ground my teeth.
Even though I knew it,
......it hurt.
Kiri arrived, just like the records said she would.
I followed her.
It should be this way.
I went straight into the trees.
My one question is:
Youko-chan,
Are you a person who acts per the status quo?
If she wasn't taking action...
Would the ravine between Kiri and I be filled?
If it isn't filled......
While holding that doubt, I went to the place of my objective.
I changed my eyes in advance.
The night appeared bright.

[Kiri]
"......hya!"

I heard a scream.

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan, stop."

[Youko]
"......"

She didn't act surprised.
She'd probably noticed my approach.

[Kiri]
"......!"

Seeing an opening, Kiri moved.
Youko-chan released a stone.

[Kiri]
"--!"

With timing like that, nothing could be done.
The stone hit Kiri hard on the calf.

[Kiri]
"Gu!!"

She stooped over.
She held her leg and gritted her teeth. There should be a spasm of violent pain running through her.

[Youko]
"............"

She put a second stone in the belt.
With the tension in her wrist, she made a disk of afterimages. In an instant.

[Kiri]
"W-......wait......"

Kiri's face turned pale.

[Kiri]
"W-why are......you......?"

[Youko]
"Because you tried to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"!?"
//Weird, this line has no voice in the source file. 〜IX

[Youko]
"Because you've been practicing to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"......s-so......you're going to kill me......?"

[Youko]
"......"

Is she serious?
For now, there's no time to think.
I can only take the planned action.

[Kiri]
"Aaah......"

She increased the number of revolutions.
The moving air made a sharp sound.
The destructive power swelling up before my eyes made Kiri cower in fear.
The finality of death.
That wasn't something Kiri could believe.
That rotational force had already imparted enough motive energy to the stone.

[Kiri]
"S-stop......"

She held the crossbow in front of her face, sobbing.
This is Kiri's limit.

[Taichi]
"That's enough."

I stood in front of Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

The revolutions fell.

[Youko]
"If I leave that alive, Taichi will suffer more injuries."

[Taichi]
"What's so wrong about that?"
[Taichi]
"......isn't it fine?"
//Interesting, he doesn't mention the reset this time. 〜IX

[Youko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Let me do as I please."

[Youko]
"......no."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan."

I said her name with force.
But she didn't seem to be backing down.
Does she still intend to kill Kiri?
I don't know.

[Youko]
"I'll take it."

[Taichi]
"You don't have to take it."

[Youko]
"Move."

[Taichi]
"I'm not moving."

Behind me, Kiri watched over us with her breath held.
The relief that she was alive, and the fact that I'd intervened were incompatible.

[Youko]
"But......"

I sensed hesitation.

[Taichi]
"I don't want to be used as a reason to kill people."
[Taichi]
"If you want to kill her then do it for your own reasons."

She flinched.
That might be an act.

[Youko]
"............but, for Taichi......I......"

For me.
She'll throw out my name and kill Kiri.
Without thinking that I'd be hurt as a result.

[Taichi]
"......you're always like that, pushing for your feelings and yours alone."
[Taichi]
"Even when I am in trouble---"

Youko-chan twisted her wrist.

[Taichi]
"......"

Kiri stuck out her head to hear our conversation.
I held my palm up in front of her face.
I thought the stone would hit my hand, but it missed and broke through the tree trunk behind me.
//Now this is the sort of subtle change that makes me glad I'm going through these scripts line by line. 〜IX

[Kiri]
"Kya!!?"

[Taichi]
"......"

......she missed.
So it was an act.
Is she helping me?
But why?
Youko-chan turned pale.

[Youko]
"Ah......sorry......forgive me......"

For a moment, she was confused.
But I continued as planned.

[Taichi]
"You betrayed me."

[Youko]
"......eh......umm......that was......"

[Taichi]
"You tried to take advantage of an opening during our conversation."
[Taichi]
"......again?"

Her shoulders shook.

[Taichi]
"You say I'm precious. You say that you love me. You push your good will onto me."
//Goodwill is a word, but it's most commonly spaced. It's also read as if there's a space (A pronnuciative pause). The way it is now looks like a spelling error to the average eye, and there's no harm, nor change of meaning in spacing it. -Neko
[Taichi]
"......and yet, at times like this, you betray me."
[Taichi]
"Again?"

[Youko]
"No, this was about......Taichi's safety......"

How inconsistent.
Just as I remember, when it comes to acting......she's really good.
We played all the parts, just the two of us, didn't we?
Now, make this go well.
I smiled on the inside.

[Taichi]
"Forget about that!"

She cowered like a young girl being yelled at.
........................
Youko-chan left.
She stealthily stole Kiri's weapons, and her will to resist.

[Taichi]
"........................"

Behind me, the emitter of the stress continued to release her aura.
I was conscious of it slowly becoming rage as I asked,

[Taichi]
"......are you hurt?"

[Kiri]
"Why?"

Her puzzlement and rage over being saved by me.
Her emotions fell apart, and she desperately suppressed her desire to scream out.
She had that sort of muffled voice.

[Kiri]
"Why......did you save me......?"

[Taichi]
"Well......even if you ask me why..."
[Taichi]
"I saved you because I wanted to. Is that wrong?"

[Kiri]
"Please don't make fun of me......"

[Taichi]
"......though I'm not doing that..."
[Taichi]
"Well, that's true. You wouldn't accept it."
[Taichi]
"Being saved by someone you hated."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Did you seriously intend to kill me?"

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Seriously now..."

[Kiri]
"You're too dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Dangerous?"

[Kiri]
"You toy with people for fun."
[Kiri]
"In this situation, you don't change a bit!"

Suddenly, her voice became violent.
She soon lowered her tone.

[Kiri]
"......you kill people as a joke."

The atmosphere stagnated.
Hatred was mixing into it.
The hatred Kiri was spewing forth.

[Taichi]
"I won't kill anymore."

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"I don't want to kill anymore."

[Kiri]
"What are you......?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri, even I know at least what I am."
[Taichi]
"I don't want to destroy anymore."
[Taichi]
"I don't want those memories."
[Taichi]
"That's why I'll fight."
[Taichi]
"I'll fight with myself."

[Kiri]
"........................"
[Kiri]
"Why......"
[Kiri]
"Why did you save me?"

Once more she started asking me.

[Kiri]
"You should've just watched me die."
[Kiri]
"You should know that I......see you as an enemy......"
[Kiri]
"You won't gain anything by saving me."

[Taichi]
"I'll gain something."
[Taichi]
"If Kiri lives and imparts some influence on my heart......that will be a gain."
[Taichi]
"Didn't we talk about that before?"

[Kiri]
"......ah......"

[Taichi]
"Also, if Kiri died, Miki would be sad."
[Taichi]
"That's not Kiri's true intention, right?"

[Kiri]
"......right."

Yes.
Kiri's just a little honest.
I simply have to not make fun of her needlessly.

[Taichi]
"Let's leave it at that. Kiri probably can't accept it that easily anyway."
[Taichi]
"But still, that was some amazing force."

The hole the stone dug in the tree.
It was completely buried inside.

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Now, let's go home."

[Kiri]
"Kurosu-sempai......I can't understand you anymore."

[Taichi]
"I see."

You're just being deceived.
For your own good.
Kiri will endlessly expect people to remain in their proper state.

[Taichi]
"Also, I think Youko-chan was serious about what she said."

[Kiri]
"?"

Kiri wiped her mouth and narrowed her eyebrows.

[Taichi]
"No more weapons. It's best not to have any."
[Taichi]
"If you break that rule, I think she'll seriously attack you."

[Kiri]
"............"

Her shoulders were shaking slightly.
From terror.

[Taichi]
"I think you'll be fine if you stay by me."
[Taichi]
"The best thing to do would be to stop showing hostility toward me."

[Kiri]
"......stop showing......hostility?"

[Taichi]
"That means to stay with me."

[Kiri]
"That's......"

[Taichi]
"You don't want to? But this is your only choice. I'll let you follow me around wherever."

[Kiri]
"May I ask you one thing?"

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Kiri]
"About Yutaka."

[Taichi]
"......aaah, that incident."
[Taichi]
"Do you have to ask it right now?"

[Kiri]
"......what do you mean? Is now a bad time?"

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't it be best to wait until Kiri's heart is calmer?"

[Kiri]
"I have calmed down......"

[Taichi]
"You don't look that way."

We became silent.

[Kiri]
"Umm......last week's guerilla campout......that was......?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah......that was so boring."
[Taichi]
"I forced it to occur, and worked to gather seven people by lying and cajoling......"
[Taichi]
"At some point the fault in that came out."

I smiled.
Kiri looked at me as if watching something heterogeneous.

[Taichi]
"We struck the tents in the worst possible mood."

[Kiri]
"......aren't you the one who planned that?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, I planned it."

[Kiri]
"In order to deepen everyone's wounds?"
//PCP Nice, it changed to a question. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"No."
[Taichi]
"......I just...wanted to return to...our normal, casual days."

[Kiri]
"......I can't believe that."

[Taichi]
"I guess not."

[Kiri]
"But, I'll stop suspecting you."

[Taichi]
"Okay......thanks."
[Taichi]
"Now then, about that wound..."

[Kiri]
"Ah, I'm fine......don't touch me!"

[Taichi]
"If I don't touch you I won't know, so,"

Her calf.
It's swelling.

[Taichi]
"......internal bleeding. She hit a good spot."
[Taichi]
"It'll hurt to walk, but it's not life-threatening."
[Taichi]
"Anything else?"

[Kiri]
"My shoulder......"

[Taichi]
"Expose it."

[Kiri]
"!?"
[Kiri]
"You...you really are a beast......"

She held her shoulders and stepped back.

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey, I was kidding. Don't take it seriously."

[Kiri]
"Isn't that how......you sexually harass Miki and the others?"

[Taichi]
"About Miki...she does reject anything she seriously dislikes."
[Taichi]
"She'll punch me while smirking and saying something like, 'Don't do that!'"

[Kiri]
"......Miki would?"

[Taichi]
"And I don't use excessive force myself."
[Taichi]
"I am adjusting the borderline through various forms of contact, but isn't that what it means to hang out with people?"

[Kiri]
"......even sexual harassment......you can speak of it as if it's something beautiful......"

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin just takes it too seriously."
[Taichi]
"I'm going to touch your shoulder."

[Kiri]
"Eh?......kya!"

I touched it lightly, and she felt pain.

[Taichi]
"......you got hit in a bad spot here."
[Taichi]
"How much does it hurt?"

[Kiri]
"......not much......I can move my arm......"

[Taichi]
"Hold it above your head."

She obeyed.

[Taichi]
"So nothing's wrong with the bone."

[Kiri]
"......Sempai just pushed too hard."

[Taichi]
"That wasn't hard at all."

[Kiri]
"......aren't all men that strong?......even Shima-sempai, despite having such slender arms, could carry a monitor by himself."

[Taichi]
"......he used to be in the Basketball Club......he can't run anymore, but his muscles haven't changed."
[Taichi]
"Well, put a compress on that."

[Kiri]
"......I understand."

[Taichi]
"Okay, then let's go home."

I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Come on, let's go."

She followed reluctantly.

[Kiri]
"Ow!"

[Taichi]
"So it does hurt?"

[Kiri]
"......please go on ahead. I can go home on my own."

[Taichi]
"Just hop on."

My back.

[Kiri]
"......th-that's okay!"

[Taichi]
"Hurry up."

[Kiri]
"I said that's okay!"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan might still be here."

[Kiri]
"......even if she is......"

[Taichi]
"Okay. Then a Sempai's orders: Hurry up and let me carry you."

[Kiri]
"......th-that's...unfair."

[Taichi]
"Huuuryyy uuup."

Unwillingly,
Kiri climbed on my back.

[Taichi]
"I'll carry you to your house."

[Kiri]
"......that's going too far......aren't I heavy?"

[Taichi]
"You call this heavy? You must be joking."

She's strangely light.
I started walking.
The grass made a comfortable rustling sound as I stepped on it.

[Taichi]
"It's a nice night, don't you think?"

[Kiri]
"......dunno."

[Taichi]
"Friday, huh?"

Three days left until the world swings back.
Today as well, I'll do what I should do.
I saw Kiri near the front door.
In fact, she was approaching the threshold.
So that I could clearly see her.
It'd be best to say something.

[Taichi]
"How're your wounds doing?"

[Kiri]
"......they're fine. They do hurt a bit though."

[Taichi]
"You should be resting at home."

[Kiri]
"No, I'm not hurt that badly."

[Taichi]
"What about Miki?"

[Kiri]
"......she doesn't seem to be coming today."
[Kiri]
"She's getting nervous."

With her experience points back to zero, Miki had become fragile.
No, she'd returned to the original Miki.
......people have disappeared after all.

[Taichi]
"......she's not doing too well."

[Kiri]
"Yes......because she's forcing herself...in many ways."

[Taichi]
"It's pretty hot."

I looked up at the sun.

[Taichi]
"I'd like to go to the beach."
[Taichi]
"We went last year. Do you remember that?"

[Kiri]
"......yes."

[Taichi]
"That was fun. Though I'm sorry about Miki."

[Kiri]
"......yes."

The beach.
We didn't go this year.
There was no point in me going alone.
Three days remaining.
Will I be able to follow through without being controlled by my dark impulses?
I wanted something healthy.
I wanted it very much.

[Taichi]
"Shall we go to the beach?"

[Kiri]
"......eh? The beach?"

[Taichi]
"I'll invite Miki too. The three of us can go."

[Kiri]
"......Miki too......"

[Taichi]
"Okay, let's go!"

[Kiri]
"D-don't just......"

I took her hand.

[Kiri]
"Kya?"

[Taichi]
"Let's go invite Miki."

[Kiri]
"But, I don't have a swimsuit with me."

[Taichi]
"There should be some in the variety store next to Miki's housing complex."

[Kiri]
"What about my opinion-"

[Taichi]
"I did save your life, so come with me on at least one date."

[Kiri]
"A...date!?"

[Taichi]
"A date with a flower in each hand."

[Kiri]
"......th-that would be......"

[Taichi]
"It's fine, it's fine, so go!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, wait, Sempai......!"

It was somewhat forceful.
And then,
I pulled out a Miki that had become thin and neurotic,
Got together the necessary things at Atomic Goods,
Procured a car,
And headed for the beach.

[Taichi]
"Okay, now this is the beach!"

A cool pose.

[Taichi]
"And!"

[Miki]
"......uuu."

[Kiri]
"......muu."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, good, that's good!"

Mine was a reserved pubescent body which might pass as an actor's.

[Miki]
"Somehow......I feel like we're being watched."

[Kiri]
"I feel that too......"

[Miki]
"If something happens, protect me."

[Kiri]
"Sorry, that might be impossible."

As I struck poses like a bodybuilder, I think I appeared to be in my downfall.
//I should mention this now: there are a number of lines below that don't make much sense to me, but I feel that is probably intentional. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Then let's play."

[Miki]
"Aaah, aaah, aaah, Kiri-chin, the ball hurts, the ball!"
//If the ball is a volleyball, how does it hurts? - Raide

[Kiri]
"I can't, can't, I said I can't!"

[Taichi]
"Sora! I'll make your hair wet!"

[Kiri]
"Stooop!"

[Miki]
"Aaah, the ball's coming down!"

[Kiri]
"I said it's impossible!"

[Taichi]
"Uwa!!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, there......ei!"

[Miki]
"Oooh, you're good!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah! Wh-wh-whoa!"
[Taichi]
"Dowaa!!?"

[Kiri]
"......hu!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha, Sempai fell over twice in a row."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, you got me."
[Taichi]
"Your side's serving."

[Miki]
"Oookay, here I gooo! Teaaah!"

[Taichi]
"Shot down!"

[Miki]
"Ah, you're good."

[Kiri]
"Leave it to me......there!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, not bad!"

[Kiri]
"It's two against one, so we can't lose."

[Taichi]
"If I can receive it regularly..."

[Miki]
"Precision shot."

[Taichi]
"Wabu!"

[Miki]
"It's a hiiit!"

[Taichi]
"Huh? How much damage did that cause?"

[Kiri]
"......three HP left."

[Taichi]
"Yikes......"

[Kiri]
"Okay, here comes the serve."

[Taichi]
"Oooh, bring it on!"

[Miki]
"Pyuuu."

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey, we're not supposed to take damage until the first group receives!"

[Miki]
"Eeeh? I didn't shoot you. I just said I did."

[Taichi]
"That's not fair!"
[Taichi]
"There, I received it! Begin attack!"

[Miki]
"And, boing."

[Taichi]
"Damn! I missed!"

[Kiri]
"Sooore!!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, not a good course......"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, a combination attack!"

[Kiri]
"Okay!"

[Taichi]
"Wa! Wa! Wa!......Sorya!"

[Miki]
"Uuaaa, he dodged them all!"

[Kiri]
"......like a monkey."

[Taichi]
"Now it's my turn! Hey, if I receive, then you lose the right to attack."
//This is the kind of comma that's supposed to pause you for only a millisecond(not literally), like 1/4th the amount of a normal one.-Spin

[Miki]
"Ah, I'm sorry."

[Taichi]
"Once I receive, I get to attack! Seyaaa! Root 'em out!"

[Kiri]
"Kya! Wait, Sempai! That won't be accepted as an effective hit with such rainy water."

[Taichi]
"Mu......the batteries have died......I think."

[Miki]
"Hu! Hu! Huuu, once we've both attacked we can attack again!"

[Taichi]
"......heeey, I can't agree to that much of a handicap!"
[Taichi]
"Even if you can't attack, a pure and simple relay is enough!"

[Miki]
"......so?"

[Kiri]
"He's strong."

[Miki]
"Yes, incredibly strong. He's always been that way."

[Kiri]
"But his energy is hollow."

[Miki]
"Yes, he's just showing off."

[Taichi]
"Hey now, don't badmouth someone in front of their face!"

[Miki]
"If you stop, you get sniped!"

[Kiri]
"Sniiipe!"

[Taichi]
"Uwaaa!!"

[Miki]
"A win for the Mikiri Team!"

[Kiri]
"......okay!"

We enjoyed our high level play which combined beach volleyball and survival games.
And then lunch.

[Taichi]
"Fuiii......it's tiring when the whole sea is the field."

[Miki]
"Same for Miki."

[Kiri]
"I'm back."

Kiri returned.

[Kiri]
"It had running gas in it, so I made a small fire."

[Miki]
"Is it really okay to use the beach house?"

[Taichi]
"In this day and age, it's perfectly fine."

[Miki]
"......aaah, I don't want to think about that too much."

[Kiri]
"Sempai, please don't harass my Miki!"

[Taichi]
"......she's yours?"

[Kiri]
"Yes she is. I won't give her to you."

[Taichi]
"Half of her is mine!"

[Miki]
"......my body's being partitioned like a defeated nation......"

[Kiri]
"I won't accept that."

[Taichi]
"Give her here."

[Miki]
"Waaan! That hurts..."

[Kiri]
"......ah."

[Taichi]
"Yaaay, miiine."

[Miki]
"No, Sempai, that was Kiri-chin's win."

[Taichi]
"Why!? Didn't I win by pulling harder?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin let go when she saw the child in pain from being pulled in both directions......that kindness is the love of a true parent."
//Inappropriate biblical reference FTW. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Gaaan!"

[Miki]
"Which means it's Kiri-chin's win."

[Kiri]
"......which doesn't matter, so can we eat now? The food's getting cold."

[Taichi]
"Even so, it's just cup ramen, canned food and rice cakes..."

[Kiri]
"Please don't speak of luxury. This is perfectly fine food."

[Miki]
"Ramen makes it feel like a beach house."

[Taichi]
"That's true."

[Miki]
"Ah, by the way Kiri, what about that?"

[Kiri]
"Nn?"

[Miki]
"Ummm, weeell..."

She glanced at me.

[Taichi]
"Is it something you don't want me to hear? Or is one of you confessing to me?"

Both of them: "We aren't."

[Taichi]
"......that chorus irritates me."
//Is it valid to use "chorus" as slang for people saying the same thing at the same time? It might just be my family that does that. 〜IX
//Yeah. Example: "I'm not editing that!" They chorused together. - Sheeta
[Taichi]
"So should I move?"

[Miki]
"Ah, that's fine."
[Miki]
"......nyan."

She mewed.

[Kiri]
"Miii."

[Miki]
"Goro-nyaaa-goro."

[Kiri]
"......nyaa, nyaa."

[Miki]
"Nya!"

[Kiri]
"Naaago!"
[Kiri]
"Nyan-nyaka-nyan!"

[Miki]
"Nyaaan......"

[Kiri]
"......uunya?"

[Miki]
"Naan......"

[Taichi]
"C-catspeak?"

Miki and Kiri were mewing 'nyaa, nyaa' at each other.

[Taichi]
"Ha, hawawa......scary..."

Before long,

[Miki]
"I see. So the day ended quickly."

She folded her arms and nodded.

[Kiri]
"......heeey, don't say it."

[Miki]
"Ah, sorry."

[Taichi]
"Were you actually talking just now?"

Have the beautiful virgin girls constructed an independent language system!?

[Taichi]
"T-tell me too."

[Miki]
"......not possible."

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

[Kiri]
"......Sempai isn't cat-like."

[Taichi]
"I'm incredibly cat-like!"

[Miki]
"Eeeh? How sooo?"

[Taichi]
"Just look."

I covered my eyes.
*click*---

[Taichi]
"See, my eyes glow in the dark!"

The beach house we were in was a bit dark.

[Miki]
"Waaa, that takes me back! Hey, hey, Kiri-chin, isn't that what I said?"

[Kiri]
"It's true......they're shining."

[Taichi]
"I say I have the right."

[Miki]
"......mysterious."

[Kiri]
"Are those contacts?"

[Taichi]
"Nope. Natural. And I can change it at will."

I closed my eyes.
*click*---

[Taichi]
"Normal Mode."

[Miki]
"Uuoooh, that's cool."

[Kiri]
"Cool......are you sure?"

[Miki]
"You can see with those in dark places, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yep. My night vision is great."

[Kiri]
"Like a cat."

[Taichi]
"Somehow, I ended up with a few catlike abnormalities. That's what the doctor said."
[Taichi]
"If I hadn't been careful I might have gone blind in my youth."

[Kiri]
"......is that so..."

[Miki]
"Ah, bathroom......"

*tap* *tap* *tap* *tap* *tap*

[Taichi]
"......me too."

*grab!*

[Taichi]
"Uuo!?"

[Kiri]
"............you mustn't peep."

[Taichi]
"Damn!"

........................

[Taichi]
"Still, Miki seems well."

[Kiri]
"......she needed a breather."

[Taichi]
"It's not that Miki's lost her emotions or anything."
[Taichi]
"She's not unemployed after all, so she's not that different from a normal healthy person."
[Taichi]
"I think she actually is managing to endure people being gone."

[Kiri]
"......that's not something we can do anything about."

[Taichi]
"Is Kiri lonely?"

[Kiri]
"......I'm......I'm not sure."
[Kiri]
"The malice is gone, but......but..."
[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"That's right. Our hearts are first formed by pressure from the other humans around us. That's why this is......it really is bad."
[Taichi]
"Quite the dilemma."
[Taichi]
"Without hearts, people are beasts. But......hearts come with a lot of problems."
[Taichi]
"Human hearts are too delicate."

[Kiri]
"......we should have just lived normally."
[Kiri]
"But......being pushed deep into these mountains......it's like we're at fault."

[Taichi]
"......well, that can't be helped."
[Taichi]
"Since some people that can hurt others got out."

[Kiri]
"......that is true, but..."

[Taichi]
"But, Kiri's a good girl."

[Kiri]
"......goho!!"
[Kiri]
"D-don't say that so suddenly......"

[Taichi]
"Kiri's head seems to be getting soft."

Kiri held her head.

[Kiri]
"Eh?......Is that so?"

[Taichi]
"May I touch it?"

[Kiri]
"......please don't touch it in a perverted way."
[Kiri]
"I'll know if you do."

Will you now?
I rubbed her head.

[Taichi]
"......it's not fluffy...but foofy."
//Yay adaptation of Japanese onomaetopoeia trickery. 〜IX
//Poofy could work - Raide

[Kiri]
"......I don't understand the difference......"

[Taichi]
"Well, anyway, do your best!"

[Kiri]
"Eh?......At what?"

[Taichi]
"The world may be filled with malice, but there's sure to be a place in it for Kiri as well."
[Taichi]
"......there's no need to forcefully take it with weapons."

[Kiri]
"???"

[Miki]
"Aaah, you're doing something that makes you look close!"

[Taichi]
"We are close."

I embraced her.

[Kiri]
"Kyo!?"

Kyo?

[Miki]
"Jealousy!!"
//Engrish, do not edit. 〜IX

She kicked and screamed.

[Miki]
"That's a complicated double jealousy!!"

She continued with the kicking and screaming.
And then flew out.

[Taichi]
"Wa!!"

[Kiri]
"Wa!!"

[Miki]
"Goro-nyaaago♪"

As she rolled around, she came closer to me.

[Taichi]
"If you stick too close, I'll get excited, so stop that......"

[Miki]
"Stick, stick."

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey."

[Miki]
"Lick, lick."

[Taichi]
"Stooop!"

[Kiri]
"Cease!!!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, too late......"

Here it is!

[Kiri]
"Gyaaa!?"

[Miki]
"T-transformation!?"

[Kiri]
"Nooooooo!!"

[Miki]
"Myaaaaaaaa!!"

[Taichi]
"......y-you're the ones that erected this five story tower! Take responsibility!! You didn't even use a single nail in its construction!!!!"

[Miki]
"That was fuuun!"

[Taichi]
"Yep. Let's go again."

[Miki]
"Yes!"

She appeared to be back in high spirits.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, those photos we took today, how long will they take to develop?"

[Miki]
"Do you want them quickly?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Tomorrow night if possible."

[Miki]
"Fast......then, I'll develop them at school, and give them to you there."

[Taichi]
"Thanks. See you."

[Kiri]
"Bye-bye."

[Miki]
"Bye-byeee!"

Miki ran off in the direction of her housing complex.

[Taichi]
"I'll walk Kiri home."

[Kiri]
"......thanks."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, I'm hungryyy..."

[Kiri]
"Do you have food?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I do, I do. Tomoki leaves a bunch of boxes."

[Kiri]
"......umm......could you come by?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Kiri]
"My place. I'll prepare dinner."

[Taichi]
"That's pretty good service."

[Kiri]
"......umm, there's something I want to talk about."

[Taichi]
"Something I want to hear?"

Kiri's breathing halted for a moment.

[Kiri]
"......yes, it is."
[Kiri]
"I want to ask you about Yutaka."
[Kiri]
"I want to settle it......if I don't, I won't know......what feelings I have toward you."

[Taichi]
"I see. Nnn..."

No, Friday is too soon.

[Taichi]
"Then can we do that tomorrow?"

[Kiri]
"Tomorrow?"

[Taichi]
"I'll talk about all of it. Lunchtime is fine too, so come tomorrow."

Yes, all of it.
Honestly.

[Kiri]
"I understand."

[Taichi]
"To school I mean."

[Kiri]
"Okay, Kurosu-sempai."

Well-mannered. Kiri-like.
She straightened her back.

[Kiri]
"Thank you for today. I'll be going now."

As if she was in some sports club.

[Taichi]
"Okay, bye-bye."

We parted---
Saturday.
......one day left.
There's one day left.
I looked in the classroom, and only Miki was there.

[Taichi]
"Where's Kiri?"

[Miki]
"Ah, good morning. Kiri-chin isn't here yet."

[Taichi]
"I see."
[Taichi]
"Did the photos come out?"

[Miki]
"I was about to start developing them."
[Miki]
"It'll be five thousand yen per print."

[Taichi]
"Expensive!"

[Miki]
"Ah, let's eat lunch with everyone."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

We decided to wait.
........................
It became midday.

[Taichi]
"......y-you're both slow!!"

I'm hungryyy...
Maybe I'll go eat by myself.
I had rice balls today.
There were seasonings on them, so they appeared quite delicious.

[Kiri]
"Good morning, Kurosu-sempai."

[Taichi]
"......you're late."

[Kiri]
"Eh?......Didn't Kurosu-sempai say lunchtime was fine?"

[Taichi]
"Did I now?"

I have a feeling I did......

[Kiri]
"I've come to talk to you."

[Taichi]
"Well, for now let's eat."
[Taichi]
"Come on, I've got enough for two."

[Kiri]
"Okay......then, I'll eat......"

[Taichi]
"And so will I."

*munch* *munch*

[Taichi]
"How are things with Youko-chan? Did she do anything disagreeable to you?"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Did she?"

[Kiri]
"......when I left my house...on my door......"

[Taichi]
"On your door?"

[Kiri]
"......'sow'...was written in graffiti."

[Taichi]
"Is she a child......?"
[Taichi]
"Was that all?"

[Kiri]
"For now."

[Taichi]
"Well, if she's not coming after you then nothing more should happen."

[Kiri]
"......why is she so good with a sling?"
[Kiri]
"It's just strange..."

[Taichi]
"For the most part, she's good at everything."
[Taichi]
"What she can do is fundamentally different."

[Kiri]
"Does she receive special training?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, she used to. She had some kind of long vacation where she went to some foreign country and hired a military instructor on the spot."

[Kiri]
"Military......!?"

She was lost for words.

[Taichi]
"Maybe she learned the sling then. She might have even learned it from a real shepherd."
[Taichi]
"Does it still hurt?"

[Kiri]
"......a little."

[Taichi]
"She's piled up a lot."
[Taichi]
"I'm sure she's done many, many other things too."
[Taichi]
"It feels like she uses most of her life as self-training."
[Taichi]
"I talk like I'm a martial artist too, but I'm no match for her."

[Kiri]
"You were doing martial arts?"

It was good of her to ask.

[Taichi]
"It's called karade."

[Kiri]
"......I don't know that."

[Taichi]
"Eh!?"

[Kiri]
"Is that a spinoff of karate?"

[Taichi]
"......guu."

I desperately resisted screaming.
This is the first time I'd stayed quiet when it was compared to karate.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-kun......if you were attacked by aliens, I'm the only one who'd be able to save you."

[Kiri]
"Are there any aliens?"

[Taichi]
"That's a trivial matter. You're missing the point."
[Taichi]
"Also, she can probably use firearms too."

Kiri's eyes flew open.
Maybe I returned to the subject too quickly?

[Taichi]
"As for martial arts, if you got into a grapple, I think you'd be killed in an instant. She knows a lot of moves, and she bought a really expensive knife recently."

[Kiri]
"......that's......to think of killing someone......for any reason......"

[Taichi]
"Weren't you trying to kill me?"

I poked her cheek.

[Kiri]
"......koho! Keho!!!"
[Kiri]
"I-I had no such clear murderous intent!!!"

[Taichi]
"It's fine, it's fine. I'm generous so I'll forgive you."
[Taichi]
"I think it's only natural for you to dislike me."

[Kiri]
"......"
[Kiri]
"I don't understand anymore......honestly."
[Kiri]
"You saved my life, and now that I can't do anything, I can't help being in this situation."
[Kiri]
"But......that's different from......Sempai now......well......I can't say it well, but......I get the feeling, you're trying desperately hard......"

[Taichi]
"......you really do have good eyes..."
[Taichi]
"Work in human resources in the future."

I hit her on the shoulders.

[Kiri]
"......before, you had a rather unpleasant feeling, I guess you could call it hedonistic, but......"
[Kiri]
"I think the current Sempai is somehow different."

My, my, this has gotten pretty serious.

[Taichi]
"......weeell, I can't fail after all."

I scratched my head.

[Taichi]
"If I was going to be reset, then I'd have a stronger will to live hedonistically."

Kiri's eyebrows moved faintly at the word 'reset.'

[Taichi]
"......that sort of thing exhausts me."
[Taichi]
"Even my heart is like that."
[Taichi]
"I do hate myself."

[Kiri]
"......hate yourself?"

[Taichi]
"For a reason similar to what Kiricchi feels."

[Kiri]
"That's......"

[Taichi]
"But I've found just one means of resolving it. Although, it is a last resort..."
[Taichi]
"......for that reason......in the end......I ...everyone......"

I looked at the sky.
A blue sky that seemed about to go away.

[Kiri]
"......ummm, Yutaka---"

Yutaka, huh...
That's a hard thing to answer.

[Taichi]
"Well, let's keep up the friendly fighting."

I cut her off and held out my right hand.

[Kiri]
"......o-okay."

Flustered, Kiri held out her right hand.
Handshake.
A handshake is proof of peace.

[Taichi]
"Now for a party celebrating the cease fire."

[Miki]
"Procurement completed!"
[Miki]
"......huuuh?"

[Taichi]
"Good work."

[Miki]
"You're already eating......and that looks delicious."

[Taichi]
"I invited her."

[Miki]
"......liarrr......and I developed these for you, Sempai."

[Taichi]
"Nice job!"

[Miki]
"Uuooo!"

Miki roared over this bitter betrayal.

[Miki]
"Then, what am I going to do with all this food?"

Miki poured out the contents of her tote bag on the desk.
It formed a mountain, spilling off the edges of the desk.

[Taichi]
"Not so much food as sweets."

This girl is seriously...

[Miki]
"Tehe!"

[Kiri]
"......what about canned food?"

[Miki]
"It's all gone."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm. Having sweets for lunch......that seems harsh."

[Miki]
"Is that so?"

[Taichi]
"It's bad for your health."

[Miki]
"But Miki loves sweets."

[Kiri]
"I'm already full myself, so..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, so am I."

[Miki]
"......eeeh?"
[Miki]
"Then I'll eat these myself."

She took offense.

[Kiri]
"......you'll get fat."

[Miki]
"......"
[Miki]
"Even if I'm fat, I'll still love sweets."

She started eating some potato chips.
That's an especially bad product for your beauty, you know.

[Taichi]
"Doesn't it bother you on the inside?"

[Miki]
"But, buuut!"

[Kiri]
"Don't cry......"

[Taichi]
"Come on, I'll give you this rice ball."

Its size is intended for an adult male, so for Miki-chin it should be just about right.
It wasn't really enough for me, but......whatever.

[Miki]
"Aaaaah, handmade fooooood."

She clung to the sleeve of the hand holding the rice ball.

[Taichi]
"Do you want it? Mmm?"

I held it up high.

[Miki]
"Ah! I want it..."

[Taichi]
"Here now, here now."

To the right.

[Miki]
"Aaauuu..."

[Taichi]
"Uriuri."

To the left.

[Miki]
"Uuuaaa..."

[Kiri]
"......you're harassing her."

[Taichi]
"......here now."

[Miki]
"Aaah, delishus!"

She started biting into it.
Leaving the mountain of sweets.

[Taichi]
"......those are......unsettling eating habits......for a girl. Is it always like this?"

[Kiri]
"It's normally canned food or bread."

[Taichi]
"Eat vegetables."

[Kiri]
"There aren't any."

[Taichi]
"Here, tomatoes. I've got two of them."

[Miki]
"Aaaaah, tomatoeees..."

[Taichi]
"Mmm? Do you want one?"

[Miki]
"I want one!"

[Taichi]
"Here now, here now."

To the right.

[Miki]
"Aaauuu..."

[Taichi]
"Uriuri."

To the left.

[Miki]
"Uuuaaa..."

[Kiri]
"............as I thought, this person......is just a bully."

[Taichi]
*sigh*

[Kiri]
"Nnnnnnn."

[Miki]
"Souuur."

[Kiri]
"But delicious......"

[Miki]
"I'm gonna cry."

[Kiri]
"It's nice to be alive."

[Miki]
"Nyauuu."

While watching Miki's and Kiri's mouths turn into a 『＊』 shape as they ate the tomatoes, I quenched my throat with a water bottle.

[Taichi]
"............"

She's watching, she's watching.
This person is really......
Just a lump of jealousy......
Showing herself to me as if I'm doing something to bother her......must be an intentional hint.

[Miki]
"What's happened?"

[Taichi]
"Well......we're just being watched with Ichihara-style intelligence gathering."

[Miki]
"Ichihara?"

[Taichi]
"Espionage techniques passed down through an incredibly skilled group led by E. Ichihara."

[Miki]
"?"

[Kiri]
"Kyaaaaa!!?"

Apparently Kiri saw her too.

[Kiri]
"Sempai! Se! Sempa......ah, that, that......"

[Taichi]
"It's okay, I'm right next to you."

[Kiri]
"......o-okay......"

[Miki]
"Eh? Eh?"

[Kiri]
"Wh-what......?"

Kiri pointed. Miki said, "Wha-?" and looked.
Youko-chan was gone.

[Miki]
"......eh? There's nothing there...what happened?"

[Kiri]
"J-just now I'm sure I......Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"The Shimura Phenomenon. Miki can no longer physically observe Youko-chan."

*Shimura Phenomenon = Taichi physics. A kind of observational problem found within stable, specific situations. That which someone can and cannot see is fixed as a personal attribute. Those attributes are often destroyed due to a major change within the situation.

[Kiri]
"......ku!"

Kiri was stressed half to death.

[Taichi]
"It's fine, it's fine. She's just intimidating you."
[Taichi]
"Ignore her, ignore."

[Kiri]
"Okay......I'll do my best. I'm good at ignoring."

[Miki]
"Now for after-meal sweeeets!"

So you are going to eat them after all?

[Kiri]
"Umm......Kurosu-sempai."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Kiri]
"You're crying......"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about that!"

[Kiri]
"It does worry me......"

[Taichi]
"It's an act. Don't be fooled. Just as robots don't have human hearts, neither does Michael......I mean neither does she have a heart."

[Youko]
"........................"

Hmmm, her eyes hurt.
And then, time for a dialogue with Kiri.
As I feared, she approached me with it after Miki flew out.

[Taichi]
"Now then..."

[Kiri]
"Ah, then please let me go to the bathroom."

[Taichi]
"Nn? I'm also going there."
[Taichi]
......*sigh*

The crucial moment.
I have to earn her trust.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"......you again?"
[Taichi]
"You're kinda cooperative."

[Youko]
"Am I?"

[Taichi]
"You came to make sure I didn't go to the other bathroom, right?"

[Youko]
"......yes."

How honest.

[Taichi]
"Don't you dislike the idea of Kiri and I reconciling?"

[Youko]
"I think what you're doing is hopeless."
[Youko]
"But, if that is your wish......it can't be helped."

Is that right?
Is that her true intention?

[Youko]
"She seems to be taking her time, so stay here for another five minutes."

[Taichi]
"......I won't go there."
[Taichi]
"After preserving my stability this long, I don't want to let it go to waste."
[Taichi]
"Besides......I'd prefer not to be grenaded."

[Youko]
"......"

She smirked.
The original Hasekura Youko, who she only occasionally showed me.
Can a human this lurid be born?

[Taichi]
"I can't help being anxious if I don't say this, so I'm sorry but,"

[Youko]
"......don't interfere, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, sorry."

[Youko]
"I won't. I'll cooperate as needed."

[Taichi]
"......I see."

[Youko]
"I hope you can obtain those memories, Taichi."

She erased her form.
And her presence.
She rubbed out her very existence.
A single walking skill materializes preternaturality.
You're not human any more---
To the first year classroom.
Deep breaths.
Now I'll fool her!
And then---

[Kiri]
"......I've been waiting."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

I stood still.
The distance between us...
I won't shorten it right now.
Because Kiri might reject me.

[Kiri]
"First, a little from me."
[Kiri]
"I've thought that you were a filthy murderer."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Kiri]
"That you...killed Yutaka."

Quiet facial features.

[Kiri]
"I looked at the roof on the day Yutaka died."
[Kiri]
"And I saw Sempai talking to Yutaka."

[Taichi]
"............"

Don't freeze, rationality.
......animal passions, go and sink.

[Kiri]
"And then Yutaka died."
[Kiri]
"I didn't notice at first. But afterward......on the roof, you......"

So it's about that.

[Kiri]
"That's why I didn't want to become involved with you."
[Kiri]
"But you got yourself involved with me."

There was hesitation in Kiri's eyes.

[Kiri]
"......and then I thought, that maybe......you... ......eat people's hearts."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."
[Taichi]
"......destroying people's hearts, to fulfill my longings......something like that?"

[Kiri]
"......that's right."

Eyes shaking anxiously.

[Kiri]
"Also......the eyes you look at me with."
[Kiri]
"At the time they made me shiver."

[Taichi]
"Yeah......they would do that."

A sharp girl.
Thus, it's hard for her to live in a world with normal people.
Her heart would be polluted immediately.
That sharpness chased this girl into Gunjou.

[Kiri]
"But, I don't know about the current you. Your true nature......no, I don't know what sort of state Sempai is in now......"
[Kiri]
"Maybe......maybe the current you is......"

Her hand hung down, out of the window.

[Kiri]
"......but this is the only thing I can do......"

She pulled up,
A cloth-wrapped bundle.
When she took off the cloth,

[Kiri]
"I'm sorry. It's okay if you choose to hate me."
[Kiri]
"So, please tell me the truth."

[Taichi]
"......"

Youko-chan, please don't move on this.
I prayed painfully.

[Taichi]
"Speaking from the conclusion, it's fine if you pull the trigger. You have that right, Kiri."

I'll accept it.
Because I'm trying to eat Kiri again.
I'll pay the price.
Now, Kiri, I've bet my life.
Come at me with all your might, Kouhai.

[Taichi]
"Yutaka's death...was a suicide."

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"But I was the cause."

An infinite silence.
Not long after,

[Kiri]
"......please continue."

First stage cleared, I guess.

[Taichi]
"It'll be a long story."

[Kiri]
"Tell it, Sempai."
[Kiri]
"And, please release me."

Hostility? Or forgiveness?
Approaching one of them.
Kiri's heart probably can't take both of them.
I moistened my throat with saliva and began talking.

[Taichi]
"A long time ago, there was a family called the Hasekuras."
[Taichi]
"They had a big house. A Western style mansion. I think it was at least ten times as big as the Kirihara's."
[Taichi]
"They were huge millionaires."
[Taichi]
"I......my mother died when I was young, and I got picked up by them."
[Taichi]
"I lived and worked there, for a husband and wife who were distant relatives of my mother."
[Taichi]
"It was a house of old customs."
[Taichi]
"The children of servants were also servants."
[Taichi]
"Since I was a child, my role was something like playing with the children of the house."
[Taichi]
"Youko-chan was their youngest daughter."

......
............
........................
She was always alone.
She didn't try to interact with anyone, family or servant.
Oh august you---
I called her that inside my mind.
I'd never exchanged words with her.
It'd been bugging me.
I didn't know what sort of people maintained the mansion, or what particulars brought it to this state of being.
But that place was like a paradise separated from the flow of time.
The people who lived here were all outside the norm.
At times, I was beckoned by her, and was treated to sweet drinks.
Clothing accessories, enjoying tea, beckoning people, taking a stroll.
Every month a large number of academic books, clothes and luxury items came to her.
A vast garden.
There were people called gardeners.
Even considering that the land was cheap and remote, it was expansive.
To me, that mansion was none other than a boundless world.
Actually, I have no memories from before the mansion period.
The world and the mansion were the same size.
At some point, it seems the ladies took a liking to me.
About me having a face like a girl.
And because of the mysterious pattern drawn in my eyes one could see from up close, I didn't bore them.
I was made to wear a dress (a particularly gaudy one) like that a girl would wear.
And then the tea parties.
A child couldn't discern the flavor of tea.
But I played along.
Against people as sweet as sugar snacks, there was no choice but to obey.
......and I didn't dislike it.
I was bored, but it was easy.
Like that, I was separated from my business of being a toy who was ridden and had his hair pulled by the young children, and I entered the new business of working as a doll.
She......august you, looked at me with an indifferent gaze.
No, she didn't even look at me.
She seemed uninterested, as her gaze always passed me by.
Hasekura Youko.
The youngest daughter.
There was no sign of her being adored by her family.
In fact, she was being neglected.
She certainly had been living in a different world from the ladies who resided in fantasies.
......in the world called reality.
Once, there was a time when I was chased out by the housecleaning laborers.
That was before I was introduced to being a doll.
I participated in the servants' duties.
Perhaps because it was their policy not to use anyone outside the mansion, they used many borrowed hands.
While inserting tea breaks every hour from ten to three, I cleaned all the rooms in order.
By evening I reached her room.
I heard her voice for the first time.

[Youko]
『......here is fine.』

Short and blunt.
Functional.
But, it was enchanting.
I glanced inside her room, but I couldn't really think of it as hers.
A number of personal computers.
All four walls covered up by bookshelves, and so many academic books that many of them were piled up on the floor.
A heavy work bench and new tools.
Miscellaneous knowledge and skills completely buried that large private room, making me associate it with a secret base.
It's true that those with unique heterogeneity live in different worlds.
There was a time when I'd asked about Hasekura Youko while wearing beautiful wardrobe and speaking like a girl at a tea party.
A quiet old lady answered.
That she's the daughter of the youngest son.
A young and cheerful lady answered.
That she was an unwanted daughter.
The three clamorous sisters twittered.
The whole story of the secret love between one of the young husbands and a rather young servant.
The burden of a daughter who didn't know love and grew attached to no one, and her likely tragic conclusion.
Though she has Hasekura blood she isn't one of the Hasekuras. They lamented that stain.
The point being that she was a taboo child.
There was no one who spoke to her, and she never spoke to anyone.
She was a blemish.
It seems that her real father, that 'young husband' person, had left to study abroad.
Her mother, the servant......was dead.
A girl who can't become anyone.
A girl who isn't desired by anyone.
Is she hurt?
No, she isn't hurt.
Hasekura Youko was strong.
She didn't take it to heart.
I think she probably had noticed.
The world was a miniature garden.
........................
During my life as a doll, I passed through the library.
I might have been influenced by her.
I had learned about etiquette and tea from the ladies.
However, wisdom and skill and truth were not there.
To make up for that, I went to the library that few used.
I often met Youko-chan there.
As before, no conversation.
Since it had somehow become a habit, I never approached her.
I had thought that she was agreeable, but I didn't wish to become friends with her.
It seems that my aesthetic inclination was established around this time.
How should I say it......I was captivated by things which were independent.
Captivated by things which live independently, and by strength.
Whether it's knowledge or skill, there is that side of things.
People gather.
They long to gather.
And at the same time, they try to preserve a sanctuary.
They desire an unencroached place just for them.
However, contacting people makes the boundary line waver.
Territory lessens and increases.
Displeasure.
Contradiction.
From the general sense of values, a lone hero is preferred to a thousand stately troops.
A sole absolute entity. A hero.
What people wish for.
It's nothing more than a wish in the form of admiration.
Do you want to live alone? Or in the crowd?......People can answer 'yes' to either one of those.
But I digress.
In the library, I read the books she read.
Because I admired her.
Or perhaps I was envious of how perfect she was.
The contents of the books were too high-level, so I didn't understand much.
But I continued reading.
Hundreds of, not meetings, but passings by, in the library.
We continued to coexist in that space without one conversation.
That period continued for a few years.
Then,
That which brought breakdown to paradise.
Because this was humanity's first paradise, it was thought of as unavoidable Providence.
Concretely speaking, it was the radical decline of the Mr. Hasekura who owned the mansion.
It was the beginning of the tragedy.
The graceful Hasekuras all disappeared.
The servants were left behind.
In Hasekura's place entered a newly rich upstart and his relatives by blood and marriage.
They were wild people.
Young and old, men and women, all came together.
Each one held the nature of rotten clam meat.
Within three days, one of the servants was assaulted.
It became an incident.
But this was a miniature garden.
A closed space.
It produced its own order.
Being enclosed in extensive mansion grounds was close to being extraterritorial.
What sort of banquets took place on those days?
There was one room of the mansion that had been used as a hall for evening parties.
The Hasekura people loved small parties, so it was used a lot.
The wild people held different evening parties here.
Without elegant conversation or fine quality cooking.
Instead, they were filled with depravity and decadence.
......I'm sure there were many victims.
For instance, there was a young servant and his wife.
The wife was gang raped.
No,
She was continually gang raped.
Her body was filled with holes through many and varied means, and she was made to obey.
The husband resisted.
He tried to save his wife by contacting the police.
The police didn't come to intervene.
They probably felt it'd be too much trouble.
They probably weren't bribed or anything.
But they could have bribed them at any time, if they ever felt like it.
I tried looking up this mansion on the internet.
There were innumerable crimes like this overlooked by the police.
When a private citizen's awareness of their own rights enlarged, it was no longer possible to simply say, 'Hey, stop!' and intervene.
There were an increasing number of people who would scream bloody murder over trivial mistakes.
So it's best not to move.
Although it's negligent,
As an organization of incomplete people, I think this was their limit.
Although sincerity is needed,
To save oneself, there are only one's own capabilities.
......when I thought that, I could control my temper.
As long as they don't cause any real damage, I could control my temper despite other people's bungling and shallow judgment.
It became such that I was entrusting a part of my heart to other people.
But that's normal.
Being normal is,
To leave your person within unjust and incomplete rules as a result of people's limits.
......it wasn't meant to be a gentle cradle.
And in this closed space, normal logic grew hazy.
It's easy for one's daily life to change into wild things.
To stand and face that, one needs a firm ego.
One needs an unwavering system for oneself.
......like hers.
Now then,
The wife was made into a plaything, made pregnant and made to get an abortion.
Many ways by which the men could be pleased were beaten into her body.
She stopped smiling.
She stopped participating in the servants' duties.
She was prohibited from wearing clothing, and she obeyed.
She was engraved with tattoos.
Obscene tattoos.
They pointed to her genitalia, showing that her husband no longer possessed her.
The wild people were competent in that aspect.
Her heart gradually sunk.
Her husband employed his last-ditch method.
He ran away with his wife.
He was too slow.
He and his wife were brought back in three days.
They'd been betting on when the husband would snap.
The husband was killed.
Next to his wife being gang raped.
His corpse was buried in the garden.
The men buried him at the foot of a sakura tree while roaring with laughter.
Well, they were a group with broken logic.
At some point, one of the men brought his family here.
The introduction of new characters. He was a pedophile.
He was equipped with the two settings of fencer and sadist.
Since he was a sadist, I called him S.
I caught S' eye.
I was once again forced into girl's clothes and made to participate in the evening parties.
This time, not for tea, but for S' desires.
S also liked being done by others.
I, who was like a young girl, was made the partner of this man.
The better half of those who did it, did it half as a joke.
Every so often one of them would awaken. (lol)
//Is LOL really supposed to be here?! It totally broke the tension -Neko
Whatever mean things were done at the evening parties, they made a point of standing out.
Something not unlike elementary school bullying took place there.
Well, that's what group psychology is.
All things are sure to have merits and demerits.
It surpassed one-sided good and evil.
Eventually, S' sadism escalated.
He brought another child.
S' son.
He'd been a bully in his school......I think.
He looked at me, and for a moment I was pressured by an atmosphere of promiscuity, then he scoffed at me.
Because of abnormal excitement?
As was demanded of him, though in fact of his own volition, he participated.
He soon began to show a talent that could make one's blood run cold.
It must have been partly because of his precociously thorough knowledge.
He soon became mad.
Everyone laughed at me.
Weeks passed as I was laughed at.
I continued receiving their attacks.

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"From here on, it'll get a bit painful."

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

Her voice was disgusted.

[Kiri]
"That part wasn't painful?"

[Taichi]
"Not that much."

[Kiri]
"Sempai......then......"

[Taichi]
"That's what destroyed me."

[Kiri]
"No......"

[Taichi]
"Well, forget about me. This is about Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"O...kay......"

She wiped her tears.

[Taichi]
"S' son was......well......"

There's no point in coating my words.

[Taichi]
"Nnn......he was Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"........................"

It stopped.
Her hand stopped shaking altogether.
Of course, it wasn't that she'd calmed down.
She lost a pitiful amount of color.
She was gazing right at me.

[Kiri]
"......wh-what are you saying......?"

Half-smiling.
She seems unable to even control her emotions.

[Taichi]
"Let's take a break."

I sat down in a chair.

[Kiri]
"......eh?......What?"

While hearing Kiri's puzzlement,
I didn't speak at all.
........................

[Taichi]
"Are you okay yet?"

[Kiri]
"......yes."

Kiri slowly stood up.
She was no longer holding up her weapon.

[Taichi]
"Do you have any questions?"

[Kiri]
"......Yutaka......did he...to Sempai......?"

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."
[Taichi]
"Well, the atmosphere was partly to blame. Small children can't disobey their parents, right?"

Kiri covered her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Yutaka's misfortune was having a father like that."

[Kiri]
"......I have heard......rumors about one of the Shinkawas......but......but!"

[Taichi]
"As you say, Kiri, there's too much malice in this world."
[Taichi]
"Yutaka was a victim of that."

[Kiri]
"But......I never heard anything about that. I lived with him for so long, how could it---"

[Taichi]
"Memory loss."

Kiri shut her mouth.
Kiri should also know that Yutaka had amnesia.
Inside Kiri, the parts of her that had been left alone and ambiguous unified at once.

[Taichi]
"Also, I know why his legs got hurt."

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"Because I was there when it happened."

[Kiri]
"......then......Sempai......you knew that when...?"

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"
[Taichi]
"I hadn't thought Yutaka had lived through that......I'd even forgotten the name Yutaka."
[Taichi]
"......meeting him was a coincidence."
[Taichi]
"Since I was made to cross-dress......it looks like he didn't know either."
[Taichi]
"Well, a lot happened and I was released......and for complicated reasons I came here."
[Taichi]
"If you think about it, it's perfectly natural."
[Taichi]
"Neither my heart nor Yutaka's should have broken from that."
[Taichi]
"I wonder if we met by necessity."

[Kiri]
"......I can't believe that."

[Taichi]
"I realized who Yutaka was after I became closer to him."

[Kiri]
"......that's why......you killed him?"

[Taichi]
"It's not like I immediately wanted to kill him."
[Taichi]
"It's all in the past after all."

[Kiri]
"Then......why?"

[Taichi]
"I thought I'd overlook it if he was suffering."
[Taichi]
"But when he was hanging out with me, he seemed happy."

[Kiri]
"......!!!"
[Kiri]
"That day......you asked me......is he happy......?"

[Taichi]
"Good memory."

I smiled.

[Taichi]
"That's right. That's what I meant."
[Taichi]
"With that, I determined that Yutaka was happy."
[Taichi]
"I wasn't controlled by a grudge or anything."
[Taichi]
"I just......wanted to try poking him. Very much so."

[Kiri]
"......uuu......"

[Taichi]
"It was a sunny day."
[Taichi]
"Just as you saw, I told him everything on the roof at the time."

[Kiri]
"......uu......"

[Taichi]
"Then he said, 'What can do I to be forgiven?'"
[Taichi]
"I didn't feel like reproaching him."
[Taichi]
"......I had just one question."
[Taichi]
"And I asked him."
[Taichi]
"'Hey, I have a question for you......why won't you go die already?'"
//Same problem as above. -Neko
[Taichi]
"......that's what I said."

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"When I did that......he really went and killed himself."

Kiri broke and fell.
I approached her, with a feeling I wanted to whisper.
I pushed against her---

[Taichi]
"I had no grudge."
[Taichi]
"But......there was no way I could accept......a group that could remain healthy while attacking people."
[Taichi]
"Whether Yutaka was that or not...... I......really......"
//Added a space due to awkward presentation in game (Ask me for a screen shot if you want it) -Neko
[Taichi]
"Now I think...since I had no grudge......things were fine the way they were."
[Taichi]
"If Yutaka had been there......I might have been able to become a little better."

[Kiri]
"Aaaaaaaaaa......!"

She wrung out a bitter cry.

[Taichi]
"He really was a good guy......I was just too broken."
[Taichi]
"However much I try to patch up my surface......like you said Kiri, I'm a monster."
[Taichi]
"That's why I'm worthless."
[Taichi]
"That's why......I......"

My heart didn't cry.
Tears wouldn't come.
I couldn't forgive myself.
No,
I decided not to forgive myself.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Waaaaaaaaaaa, uwa, aaaaaaaaa!!!"

[Taichi]
"At the time, in that abnormal atmosphere, in order to preserve himself, Yutaka had no choice but to devour the weaker me."
[Taichi]
"And then I made food out of Yutaka......"
[Taichi]
"Yutaka and I ate each other, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"......!"

Kiri embraced me.
On the spur of the moment......she embraced me.

[Kiri]
"I'm sorry......"
[Kiri]
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!"
[Kiri]
"I'm sorryyyy......"

[Taichi]
"Don't apologize. That's not what this is about......"
[Taichi]
"Please cry, in my place."

Her voice rose yet higher.
My house.
Today, in this consistently lonely space, there is a flower.

[Taichi]
"Now, come in."

[Kiri]
"O-okay then......"

After that, Kiri came to my house.

[Kiri]
"Uwaa."

My room was in love with chaos.
Most visitors were surprised by it.

[Taichi]
"Be seated."

[Kiri]
"......sit where?"

[Taichi]
"Okay."

I somersaulted.

[Kiri]
"......okay...?"

[Taichi]
"Make some space wherever you want to sit."

[Kiri]
"........................"

Self-responsibility.
In the space I'd made by somersaulting, Kiri sat down in an awkward seiza.

[Kiri]
"......boys..."

[Taichi]
"Wait here a minute."

I went downstairs and brought up a tomato.

[Taichi]
"Here, vitamins."

[Kiri]
"......thank you."

She took a bite from the tomato.

[Taichi]
"You can relax."

[Kiri]
"......okay."

[Taichi]
"So, you said there was more to talk about?"

[Kiri]
"Regarding atonement."

[Taichi]
"Atonement?"

I had a feeling this would come up.

[Kiri]
"For what Yutaka did, and for my horrible treatment of Sempai, and for today's attempted murder."
[Kiri]
"......since the police aren't around......I think Sempai should decide."
[Kiri]
"For both Yutaka and I."

[Taichi]
"Meaning I can have two wishes?"

[Kiri]
"......it doesn't matter how many."
[Kiri]
"Although the sins probably won't go away."

[Taichi]
"I don't care about the sins."

Yutaka and I did each other in.

[Taichi]
"That's right......for now, I do have one wish."

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow morning......I want you to come with me."

[Kiri]
"......okay, I understand."

[Taichi]
"Any questions?"

[Kiri]
"None. I will obey."

[Taichi]
"......nnn."
[Taichi]
"Well, we'll be climbing a mountain."

[Kiri]
"A mountain?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, didn't we do that for the campout? That's how far we'll be going."

[Kiri]
"Okay, I understand."

I've done it.

[Kiri]
"Is there anything else?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?......Something else?"

I hadn't thought of that.
What should I do?

[Kiri]
"I'm fine with anything."

[Taichi]
"......then..."

I brought my lips closer.

[Kiri]
"......!?"

A deep and long-term one is dangerous. It'd dehydrate me.

[Taichi]
"That should about do it."

I let go of her.

[Kiri]
"Ah! Umm! Umm!?"

[Taichi]
"Don't think too much about it."

[Kiri]
"Bu-! Bu-! But!"

[Taichi]
"It's fine. Anyway, with that my wishes are granted! Yay! Pretty girl killer. Amazing, super-cool and attractive!"

Cooldown.

[Taichi]
"......bedtime. Go home."

I got into bed.

[Kiri]
"......Sempai!"

She took my arm.

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow, please come here at six and wake me up."

[Kiri]
"......then......I'll stay here."

[Taichi]
"You know...this isn't just about you......"

[Kiri]
"......stupid person."

[Taichi]
"Nn......nnn!?"

This time it was Kiri's idea.
And then, morning---
I woke up.

[Taichi]
"......Kiri?"

She's not here.
Last night, I was sure she......

[Kiri]
"Good morning, Taichi-sempai."

[Taichi]
"......so it's Taichi-sempai now."

[Kiri]
"Umm, I thought of having breakfast, but......"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, there's nothing here."

[Kiri]
"There were potatoes."

[Taichi]
"What? There was something that good?"

I had a feeling they'd been there.
........................

[Kiri]
"I tried steaming them."

[Taichi]
"......hoo, hoo-hoo."

My appetite suddenly welled up.

[Kiri]
"Here's the salt."

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'll eat."

A pile of potatoes.

[Kiri]
"These are delicious."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, they're good. The fire worked."

[Kiri]
"Though it'd be nice if we had butter."

[Taichi]
"What? You'll be able to eat whatever you want soon enough."

[Kiri]
"Eh?......Why is that?"

[Taichi]
"Ah......uhhh......well, you'll see."

[Kiri]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Uuooo, you ate them, you ate them."

[Kiri]
"Yes I did."

[Taichi]
"Ah, not good, I have to get ready."

[Kiri]
"......ah, for climbing the mountain?"
[Kiri]
"You're getting wrapped up in that."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, we're going with nothing but the clothes on our back."

[Kiri]
"Haa......"

[Taichi]
"By the way......don't you have any doubts about this?"

[Kiri]
"......no, I have none."

[Taichi]
"Don't overdo it. Sins are just concepts after all."

[Kiri]
"Saying this might anger you, but..."
[Kiri]
"......I'm a little happy."

[Taichi]
"Happy?"

[Kiri]
"Because Sempai thinks of Yutaka as a friend."

[Taichi]
"......yeah."

[Kiri]
"You two were always working hard at school."

[Taichi]
"Weren't you of one mind and body?"

[Kiri]
"Yes, that's right."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, Yutaka went away......and that's when you became of one mind and body with Miki."

[Kiri]
"Yes."
[Kiri]
"......is that sort of thing unfair?"

[Taichi]
"Not at all. Well, not that my assurance counts for anything."

[Kiri]
"That's not......"

[Taichi]
"Now then, mountain climbing, mountain climbing, let's go."

[Kiri]
"Yeah."
[Kiri]
"Hey, hey, Sempai."

[Taichi]
"Nnn?"

[Kiri]
"......I think I'd like to try becoming what's called a love slave."

[Taichi]
"Hu!"

I blew out a laugh.

[Taichi]
"Are you out of your mind, Kiricchi!?"

[Kiri]
"Does that make a difference?"
[Kiri]
"Besides, didn't you often talk about love slaves, Sempai?"
[Kiri]
"You shouldn't be objecting."

[Taichi]
"I did, I did, but those were all jokes."

[Kiri]
"I'm not used to it, but I hope it goes well."

[Taichi]
"Don't hope for that!"

[Kiri]
"Aha!"

[Taichi]
"......were you making fun of me?"

[Kiri]
"No, God forbid."

[Taichi]
"Hu......once we settle this I'm going to harass you again."

[Kiri]
"Go ahead!"

[Taichi]
"I'm going to flip your skirt."

[Kiri]
"Go ahead!"

[Taichi]
"Uhhh......I'll do the full set of perverted pranks."

[Kiri]
"Go ahead!"

[Taichi]
"......hey now, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Whatever it is, go ahead!"
[Kiri]
"......would that be bad?"

[Taichi]
"It's not that it'd be bad......it's just that I'd become worthless."

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"And if that's what this is about, I do have someone else."

[Kiri]
"Ah......Hasekura-sempai......"
[Kiri]
"Umm, about Hasekura-sempai and Taichi-sempai...... well......"

[Taichi]
"She's been stalking me."

[Kiri]
"Does that bother you?"

[Taichi]
"It bothers me a lot. I want to get rid of her."

[Kiri]
"......how would you like that?"

[Taichi]
"That?"

[Kiri]
"I'll chase her away."

[Taichi]
"......hey, hey, you're going for way too high a difficulty there......Kiri-chin is no match for her."

[Kiri]
"I'll train and study a lot."

[Taichi]
"Impossible......her skills as a stalker are just too different from anyone else's."

[Kiri]
"I'll duel her in love, as a love slave."

[Taichi]
"......nnn, but Kiri is cowardly and weak, so......I think that'd be hard."

[Kiri]
"......eh?......That's not..."

[Taichi]
"Besides, wouldn't that make you dependent on me?"

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"That's fine, but I'm bad for you, Kiricchi."

[Kiri]
"......then, what can I do......to belong somewhere......"

[Taichi]
"I have a hunch about where Kiricchi belongs."
[Taichi]
"We're heading there now."

[Kiri]
"Where is it......?"

[Taichi]
"There, we've made it."

[Kiri]
"......a Shinto shrine?"

[Taichi]
"Well, that part doesn't matter. This way, this way."

[Kiri]
"......there's nothing here."

[Taichi]
"Put this in your pocket."

[Kiri]
"A radio? Okay......"

[Taichi]
"Now, Kiri......I'm going to observe from here, so will you walk straight that way for me?"

[Kiri]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Straight that way."

[Kiri]
"Sure, but......?"

[Taichi]
"Slowly. Please stop when I tell you to."

[Kiri]
"......okay?"
[Kiri]
"Slowly, slowly..."

[Taichi]
"A little farther."

[Kiri]
"Just about..."

[Taichi]
"A little to the right!"

[Kiri]
"This way?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."
[Taichi]
"Slow forward at 0.5 speed."

[Kiri]
"Uwa, I don't know......you mean slowly?"

[Taichi]
"Stop there."

[Kiri]
"Yes!"

Okay, that's the spot.

[Kiri]
"?"

Now I change my eyes......

[Taichi]
"Hey, Kiricchi."

[Kiri]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Where you belong."

[Kiri]
"Eh? What are you?"

[Taichi]
"Where you belong, Kiri. A way to obtain that place."

[Kiri]
"Where I belong?"

[Taichi]
"Didn't you talk about it? The clashing of hearts?"

[Kiri]
"Haa?"

[Taichi]
"You're too sharp for your delicacy, so you see a lot more than most people."
[Taichi]
"With those eyes, you should be able to find people that are precious to you."

[Kiri]
"Haha......thank you!"
[Kiri]
"But there already is someone precious to me!"

[Taichi]
"No......you're going to find new ones."
[Taichi]
"Also, I'll send Miki to you later."

[Kiri]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Painful things, unreasonable things, malice..."
[Taichi]
"It's all full of joy and sorrow."
[Taichi]
"A world with people is better than a world with nothing."
[Taichi]
"You understand that, right?"
[Taichi]
"That's why you can do your best."

[Kiri]
"Sempai? What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"This will be the last time I see you."
[Taichi]
"I'll be thankful when I use the memories you've given me."

[Kiri]
"I don't understand you......"

[Taichi]
"Good luck to you!"

Salute.
The unease on Kiri's expression increased.

[Kiri]
"What......are......?"
[Kiri]
"What are you trying to do!?"

Before Kiri could rush back here.
The crimson...
And then,
*click*---
I 『observed』 her.
I closed my eyes, and when I opened them---

[Kiri]
"What are you trying to do!?"
[Kiri]
"......huh?"
[Kiri]
"Eh?......Sempai? Where are you?"
[Kiri]
"Sempai! Hey, Sempai!"
[Kiri]
"Huh?......He's gone......what?"
[Kiri]
"......the town......eh?"
[Kiri]
"It has...people?"
[Kiri]
"The radio......it's receiving......"
[Kiri]
"A broadcast!!?"
[Kiri]
"This is......?"
[Kiri]
"Sempai! Sempai! Sempai! SempaiSempaiSempaiSempai!!"
[Kiri]
"Haa!......Taichi...sempai......?"
[Kiri]
"......you're gone?"
[Kiri]
"No, why......"
[Kiri]
"Why are you gone......!?"
[Kiri]
"......I don't...understand......"
[Kiri]
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
[Kiri]
"Aaaaaaaaaa!!"
[Kiri]
"Haa, haa......why......uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
//Ok, Kiri's up there with Sakuraba as my favorite character now.-Spin

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"This is how it should be."
[Taichi]
"Kiri."

I called to her just once.
Naturally, there was no reaction.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

Only I can observe.
And the axes of the many worlds are overlapping without limit.
That's why Kiri is right beside me.
We just can't sense each other.
We're living in the same world.
Though we can't connect no matter what we do,
The moment I observed, I fixed reality.
No,
All possibilities are on the same axis from the start.
It's just a matter of......whether or not someone can see them.
Now then,
I'll wait for time again.
I'll return to my camp and enter my tent.
Almost time.
I'll go to sleep, and when I wake up...
Next week---
