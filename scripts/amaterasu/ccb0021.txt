I poked my head into the classroom, and Touko was there.
I stood still, surprised.

[Taichi]
"......Kirihara."

Her gaze lazily swam past me, almost as if she could see right through me.
Touko's cheeks were sunken.
Her skin was pale.
Her hair was falling apart.
The lamplight of her life was dimming.
She was resting her head indifferently on the desk.
Was Touko rotting away, untouched by anyone?
In this world where humanity has met its end.
Was she unable to endure the shock?
Everyone dies alone in the end.
But until they die, they have to keep living.
I approached her, and spoke to her.
As gently as I could.
Even if that's hypocrisy......I don't care.
Because I exist in order to commit hypocrisy.

[Taichi]
"I know you don't like it, but would you try coming to the club tomorrow?"

[Touko]
"......eh?"

She raised her gaze with an expression of perplexity and indecision.
Those haggard features took on a shade of scarlet, giving an impression both brave and tragic.

[Taichi]
"Okay?"

I left a water bottle and a wrapped sandwich on the table.
Leftovers from our sea bath.
There was just enough for one.
Touko gazed intently upon it.

[Taichi]
"If you don't eat up, you're going to get sick."

[Touko]
"......I have no appetite."

A hoarse voice.

[Taichi]
"Okay, I get it. Now you eat."

[Touko]
"............"

Her hand slowly extended.
Taking off the plastic.
Biting small pieces.

[Taichi]
"......take your time. There's water too."

[Touko]
"............uu!"

She covered her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Ah, are you okay?"

[Touko]
"I'm okay, don't worry about it."

She shook me off.
Her conduct was weak, but her will to reject was certain.

[Taichi]
"......Kiriharaaa..."

An awkward silence.

[Touko]
"I'll take this."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Touko]
"I'll eat it at home."

[Taichi]
"Oh......are you sure?"

[Touko]
"......yes."
[Touko]
"Thank you."

She smoothly produced words of thanks.

[Taichi]
"......I plan to help out with the club on Sunday."
[Taichi]
"You should come if you feel up to it."
[Taichi]
"We'll put out an SOS."
[Taichi]
"Though we probably won't have a very wide range,"
[Taichi]
"We can do all kinds of directions and frequency bands and tuning."
[Taichi]
"Those are our new club activities."
[Taichi]
"......not bad, right?"

[Touko]
"......you're right."

I felt that I'd renovated just a little of my horrible relationship with Touko.
