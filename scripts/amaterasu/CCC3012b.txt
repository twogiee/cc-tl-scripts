......I don't know what's going on, but,
It wouldn't be smart to pry into it.
Anyway, the existence which just aroused a chill is bothering me.
Is there an alien or something in my house?

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu......"

I'm a weak, modern boy who doesn't even have a single flamethrower.
Even if an alien came out, I'd have no weapons to resist it with.
But!
I took a stance.
I don't need weapons.
I need only my fists.

[Taichi]
"Has the time come to employ these in real battle?"

I have endured that which was hard to endure along the lengthy path of karade.
Slander, defamation and lawsuits come with being a subspecies of karate.
Several of my comrades strayed from the path.
But now that humanity is being eradicated from Earth, my long-cherished ambition has come!

[Taichi]
"My fists cry for blood."

While soliloquizing a martial artsy line, I headed downstairs.
Gone.
That thick killing intent.
It wasn't ordinary.
The bathroom......nothing.
The bathtub......nothing.

[Taichi]
"......hmm."

The first floor storeroom......empty.
Mutsumi-san's bedroom......empty.
Ah, it's getting dusty.
......I'll clean this room later.
I'm sorry Mutsumi-san.
I bowed as I left.
Where else could it be?
There was one room I hadn't searched.

[Taichi]
"It couldn't be..."

I returned to the second floor.
My room......or next to it.
Onee-chan's room.
I put my hand on the doorknob.
I hadn't been in here in a while.
Not since Youko-chan left this house.
I slowly opened the door.
At the same time I flew into the room, I danced!

[Taichi]
"Ha! Se-ya! Tiryaaa!!!"

The dust danced too.

[Taichi]
"............"

No one's here.

[Taichi]
"What am I doing......?"

I was embarrassed.
I left the room.
Since I'd run wild in the middle of all that dust, my throat was parched.
I returned to the living room where Sakuraba, who'd drunk the water left overnight, was eating tomatoes.
*Using the new technique of Real Time Monologue

[Taichi]
"Cheryaaaaaa!!!"

[Sakuraba]
"Gofu!"

Sakuraba collapsed, but he didn't let go of the tomato.

[Taichi]
"What are you doing?"

[Sakuraba]
"Please listen."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Sakuraba]
"I've grown bored of curry bread."

[Taichi]
"......you know..."

[Sakuraba]
"So I tried coming to your house, since I thought there might be tomatoes."

[Taichi]
"Why did you come to my house?"

[Sakuraba]
"I told Tomoki I didn't need food."

[Taichi]
"Wh-why?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because I had curry bread."

What a limited life.

[Sakuraba]
"That is why, I'll be a nuisance starting today."

[Taichi]
"Whyyy!?"

[Sakuraba]
"Due to the above reasons, from this very day Sakuraba Hiroshi will now be living in Kurosu Taichi's house."

[Taichi]
"Who said they didn't understand what you said!?"

[Sakuraba]
"Please lend me a room."

This guy......this guy-!
He's insane.
He's insane to an insanely normal degree!

[Taichi]
"Ho, hoo......you're leaving that huge mansion to live here?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah. It's huge, but there's no food."

[Taichi]
"Isn't that okay?"

It'd be a waste of time to persuade Sakuraba the obocchama with logic.

[Taichi]
"Well then why don't I show you to your room?"
(TL Note: "Obocchama" is effectively the masculine version of "Ojou-sama.")

[Sakuraba]
"Please do."

I showed him the toilet.

[Taichi]
"This is your room."

[Sakuraba]
"It's small."

[Taichi]
"Only eight tatamis."
[Taichi]
"This is a commoner's house after all."
(TL Note: In Japan, square footage is often measured in "tatami" or "folding mats," which, depending on the region, vary from about 1.5 to about 2 square meters.)
[Taichi]
"Isn't your room huge? Are you sure you wouldn't prefer your own house?"

[Sakuraba]
"Not that huge, it only feels like sixteen tatamis, so double this room."

[Taichi]
"Sixteen tatamis!!?"

What kind of room were you living in!?

[Sakuraba]
"It felt like more than double this......but I guess my room is smaller than I thought."

[Taichi]
"Pay more attention."

This guy might not be a primate.

[Sakuraba]
"On my twelfth birthday, daddy gave me the room with the most sunlight."

Daddy!!?
This guy's house is definitely weird......I've reconfirmed that.

[Taichi]
"Hey......how much is your allowance?"

I unconsciously changed the pronoun when I asked.
By the way, thanks to the resourceful Mutsumi-san, I received twenty thousand yen a month.
(TL Note: Japanese has several versions of the word "you." Until now Taichi's been using the default, "omae," to address Sakuraba, but he just switched to the far cruder "kisama," which is purposely insulting.)
Other than meal expenses.
It's a pretty good standard.
I felt a sense of pride.
If I felt like it, every month I could buy a pair of the Hit Uni*n brand rare discontinued 667-N (style number) bloomers that have been rising in price recently!
There definitely aren't many students who are guaranteed such a fetish life.

[Sakuraba]
"I don't get that much."

What a thing for Sakuraba to say.

[Sakuraba]
"Fifty thousand."

[Taichi]
"Confiscation!"

I broke down, revolving.
(TL Note: On the Japanese game show "Fushigi Hakken (Mystery Found)," dolls are given for right answers, and when a wrong answer is given they are taken away while this is shouted.)

[Taichi]
"Re-really?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Which entertainer are you the son of!?"

[Sakuraba]
"Why are you mad?"
[Sakuraba]
"I'm not an entertainer in the first place."
[Sakuraba]
"I am me."

[Taichi]
"Save that kind of line for when you come to terms with yourself at the end of a grand agonizing over the purpose of your own existence."

Fifty thousand?
That's outside normal bounds.
Wait,

[Taichi]
"......hey, what would you do if I said to hand over five million for the deposit on your rent here?"

Sakuraba shook his head.

[Sakuraba]
"I don't have that much money on hand."

[Taichi]
"......then, what if I told you to give me all the money you have right now?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's only pocket change."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

He took out his wallet.
I took it from him.
I see, this certainly is pocket change.
I heard jingling noises.
I was relieved.
The fire of jealousy quieted.

[Taichi]
"Haha, even obocchamas are poor at times."

Sakuraba smiled peacefully.

[Sakuraba]
"Well yeah. Being rich is like that."
[Sakuraba]
"Just as the room of a commoner's house is like this."

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

[Sakuraba]
"Haha!"

We laughed together.
We crossed our arms.
Our friendship deepened.

[Taichi]
"Besides, it'd be meaningless to take your money now."

[Sakuraba]
"That's true."

[Taichi]
"Come to think of it, I've loaned you my pocket change a number of times."

[Sakuraba]
"Then that should repay it all."

[Taichi]
"That was meaningless."

[Sakuraba]
"I give back what I borrowed."

[Taichi]
"What an honest guy. But I guess I'll let you pay it back for memory's sake."

We laughed together like a brook.
I opened his wallet.
As I feared, there was no paper money.
Inside were fifteen coins, each a hundred thousand yen.

[Taichi]
"Mister yen!!"

Swoon.

[Sakuraba]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"

I writhed around like a caterpillar.
What's with this wallet!!?
I've never seen something so amazing!!
On closer inspection, it wasn't just hundred thousand yen coins.
Hundred thousand yen gold coin in memorial of the Shouwa emperor who reigned for sixty years X 8
Hundred thousand yen gold coin in memorial of the emperor's accession to the throne X 7
Fifty thousand yen gold coin in memorial of his highness the crown prince's wedding X 2
Five thousand yen coin depicting the International Garden and Greenery Exposition X 4
Five thousand yen silver coin depicting the crown prince's wedding X 3
And that's not all.

[Taichi]
"Are you a moron!?"

[Sakuraba]
"I couldn't really use these for buying stuff."

[Taichi]
"Of course not!"

This guy......flashing such huge sums around......
For the Sakurabas......could a hundred thousand yen possibly......not be that big......not be that big......? (echo)

[Taichi]
"Ha!?"

Before humanity's annihilation, if I'd pestered him just once during the time when money held meaning...

[Taichi]
"Ou-ou-ou-ou!"

[Sakuraba]
"Why do you cry?"

[Taichi]
"OOOOOoooo!!"

God is being allowed to torture us!
I was filled with regret.

[Taichi]
"Forget it......please sleep......"

[Sakuraba]
"Aaah, that I will."

Sakuraba holed himself up in the bathroom.

[Taichi]
"......haa."

I'm tired.
Well, all because of him.
No doubt he'll forget about this in a night and go somewhere else.
Since he has wanderlust.
He'd helped himself to the tomatoes.
I ate one that was left over. It was just right for a late-night snack.
A presence behind me.

[Taichi]
"......Sakuraba? You already feel like leaving?"

[Youko]
"Taichi......"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan?"

She was standing in the living room.

[Taichi]
"What're you doing here this late?"

I told her not to come into my house.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

The atmosphere was different.

[Taichi]
"What's...wrong?"

Youko-chan is......just like......who she was back then......

[Youko]
"......Taichi......"

She approached me.

[Taichi]
"Wa......it......?"

I backed up.

[Youko]
"Taichi!"

She hugged me.

[Taichi]
"......!"

[Youko]
"Taichi......"

I didn't understand.

[Taichi]
"What...is wrong?"

But she soon let go.

[Youko]
"......there's a piece of tomato on your mouth."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

Her head approached mine.
Her tongue grazed over the edges of her lips.
And like that, her lips......

[Taichi]
"Wait."

Before they reached me, I grabbed her shoulders and pushed her away.

[Youko]
"......Taichi!......Taichiii......"

This is rare.
For her to be this unstable.
Heat undulated in my lower abdomen.
Reacting to the weak part of her, though she was always strong.

[Taichi]
"You can't!"

[Youko]
"But..."

[Taichi]
"......didn't we decide not to do it in this house?"
[Taichi]
"That was our promise with Mutsumi-san."
[Taichi]
"I'll keep that promise."
[Taichi]
"And I'll have you keep it too."

[Youko]
"Mutsumi is no longer here."

[Taichi]
"The promise still is!"

I screamed violently.

[Taichi]
"It's still here, inside my heart."

[Youko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"I'll decide whether this promise disappeared or not."
[Taichi]
"Regardless of you, I'll decide my own will and responsibility."

[Youko]
"Again......you say such things......"
[Youko]
"You're harassing me, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Are you going to leave?"
[Taichi]
"You can't come into this house."
[Taichi]
"......you can't be comforted by me."

[Youko]
"......"

Without a word.
Youko-chan left.
She stopped and stood still once to look at my face.
The thin mask on her expression was smooth, with neither disappointment nor dejection stuck to it.
Even so, mysteriously, she looked horribly worn out to me.

[Taichi]
"Good night."

[Youko]
"......good night, Taichi."
[Youko]
"I love you."

She disappeared.
I remained in my cornered posture, with my back against the fridge, and slowly slid to the floor in a crouch.

[Taichi]
"What was that about?"
