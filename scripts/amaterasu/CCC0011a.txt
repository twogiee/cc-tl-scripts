There was no one in the club room.
The room feels small when we're playing around, but now that it's empty it looks peaceful.
The camouflage stuck on the hallway's side of the window was peeling off.
Those were pictures of an empty room printed out sideways and carefully lined up together.
//Hmm, for some reason "these" sounded really wrong in that line. I think it's because he said they were stuck on the "hallway's side" but he was inside the clubroom.-Spin
It's surprising what can be kept from you by a simple pane of glass.

[Taichi]
"............"

We were always hanging out around here.
Tomoki would sit down and read manga.
Sakuraba would be here too.
And Sempai.
Here was Miki and Kiri's standard location.
Miyuki......after that, I think she moved into class X right away.
Her condition had worsened.
Class X is different from the others.
At Gunjou, it was the end of the line.
Though it happens to be the happiest class...

[Taichi]
"............"

It's as if people's hearts can't be predicted at all.
Even though she was perfectly normal, one day, right out of the blue......
There were people said to be at the limit of the human species.
But I don't believe that.
......disease.
People become unable to contact, and quench their hearts' thirst through various media.
It was like putting hazardous chemicals into your mouth instead of real food.
......it was all so twisted.
That result was......this.
'Seriously Unadaptable Person Isolation Facility'
               Gunjou Institute
Happy students, sturdy guards, therapists and psychiatrists are stationed here......a unique educational facility introduced as a part of policies mitigating excessive benefits from the atomic power plant.
Heal your hearts naturally.
An optimistic catch phrase.
But everyone knows.
There's only one way to heal those with low adaptation coefficients.
Beneficial contact with people.
That is to say,
We have to touch each other.
But how can the frightened teachers and guards fulfill that role?
There's no way they could.
They have to make wounded boys and girls open up their hearts to one another.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi?"

Tomoki came over to me.

[Taichi]
"Yo, siscon."

He was displeased.

[Tomoki]
"......that's not true anymore."

[Taichi]
"Say what?"

Unadaptive people tend to hold antagonism or terror toward others easily.
In the former case, they're dangerous people, and in the latter, they're pitiful children.

[Tomoki]
"......so Taichi came here too."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, well yeah. I wanted to know the situation."
[Taichi]
"How is it?"

[Tomoki]
"The same."
[Tomoki]
"Since there are no classes, we quickly ran out of things to do."

[Taichi]
"What about those new club activities? The Provision Procurement Club or something?"

[Tomoki]
"Active Life Maintenance Club."
//These club names are surprisingly annoying to adapt. ã€œIX

[Taichi]
"Weird name."

[Tomoki]
"The name doesn't matter at all."

When we all confirmed the situation on Sunday night, the first thing we thought about was food.
Then Tomoki proposed that he would collect all the food remaining in the town and divide it up fairly.
I offered to help, but he refused.
Since snack stealing appears to be taboo.

[Tomoki]
"It's no job to be assigned to someone who eats several times more than a normal person."

[Taichi]
"I told you, I don't eat that much."

That was Yuusa's mama acting on her own......

[Tomoki]
"Anyway, this calms me down."

He sat down in his standard location and unfolded a map.
A map of the town.
He'd drawn symbols on it with a red pen.

[Tomoki]
"That was all dried foods, so I'll put it in storage......as for the perishables here......"

He muttered as he glared at the map.
That form of him overlapped for an instant with the manga-reading Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"......haha."

[Tomoki]
"Nn? What?"

[Taichi]
"Oh no,"
[Taichi]
"It's nothing."

[Tomoki]
"?"

I took out some rubber tape and repaired the camouflage.
A meaningless act.
But Tomoki said nothing.
