[Taichi]
"Kiri."

Her whole body tensed up.
She slowly turned around.
When she did, her features were grave.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Kiri]
"......what do you want?"

A low voice.

[Taichi]
"Is Miki-kun here?"

[Kiri]
"......she isn't."

[Taichi]
"I see."

I knew that.

[Taichi]
"She was loitering around the shopping district. She felt emotionally unstable."

[Kiri]
"Miki was......?"

[Taichi]
"Why not go to her?"

Kiri flew out of the classroom without answering.

[Taichi]
"Hey, take this."

[Kiri]
"......wh-?"

[Taichi]
"Lunch. I promised to give this to Miki."

A lie.
But if I don't say it, Kiri won't accept it.

[Kiri]
"......why would you......?"

[Taichi]
"Come on, hurry up. She was crying."

Kiri shot a dubious glance and ran away.
Okay, that should do it.
I heaved a huge sigh.
I'll have to set aside time for Kiri every day.
On Sunday, the world will roll back.
Restoration day.
Maybe this world is ideal for me.
A world where mortal wounds aren't mortal.
Back to normal in a week.
Whoever I hurt, whoever I depend on,
Reset.
I'll get close to Touko, then Mimi-sempai next,
Then Kiri,
Then Miki,
Then Youko-chan if I feel like it,
Then Sakuraba,
......not him.
However,
There's a place avoiding the reset, where possibilities lie.
It's not perfect opportunism.
Which is why I---
It was early summer last year,
When I met Shinkawa Yutaka.
A summer of noisy cicadas.

[Shinkawa]
『Okay, I get the feeling this'll work somehow.』

[Taichi]
"............"

I wonder who was wrong.
I can't blame it on destiny.
Someone was wrong. Or perhaps, no one was wrong.
If that's admitted, then there aren't that many conclusions.
