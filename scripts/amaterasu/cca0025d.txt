Okay! Leave it to me!

[Taichi]
"Sempai."

[Misato]
"......whaaat?"

[Taichi]
"Please marry me!"

I pointed upward as I confessed.

[Misato]
"Ufu."

Sempai smiled as softly as an angel.

[Misato]
"Absolutely not♪"

[Taichi]
"Hello, Tomoki? This is Kurosu. Yeah, I just got turned down by your nee-chan. Yeah, seriously, right now. She's still right here next to me. Buhyahyahyahya!

"Anyway, anyway, my chest right now is filling up with both pain and pleasure. I'm so glad you pushed me into telling her my feelings! Now go die!!"

[Misato]
"That phone......aren't its batteries dead?"

[Taichi]
"I know that much!"

I threw myself down in tears.

[Taichi]
"Uooon!"

[Misato]
"You don't have to tell him......"

[Taichi]
"I was fully aware it was a joke because I thought it might get the mood going but that was clearly just a silly expectation of mine but now my heart hurts from being so flatly rejected!"

[Misato]
"Isn't the problem that you confessed with the perfect timing to be rejected......?"

[Taichi]
"Darkness lies only an inch farther in life! I have no choice but to believe in the now!"

[Misato]
"Come on, I'll give you some pickled cucumbers, so cheer up. And let's stop using the wrestling voice, okay?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, is my love to be bought with cucumbers......?"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, I'm sure you'll have a much more wonderful significant other than me."

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna cry."

The cucumbers tasted like unrequited love.
