[Taichi]
"Hellooo."

[Miki]
"......oh, heya."

I returned to the roof.

[Miki]
"Ah, you brought Kiri-chin with you."

[Taichi]
"I most certainly did."

[Misato]
"Somehow......you seem brighter......"

[Taichi]
"I am bright."

[Miki]
"......what happened, Kiri-chin?"

[Kiri]
"Eh? Oh, no, it's nothing......"

[Miki]
"Your menstruation ended, right?"

[Kiri]
"I-it ended, but......"

She shuffled her legs together.

[Misato]
"......your complexion doesn't look good. Are you okay?"

[Kiri]
"I'm okay. Just a little tired......since it's summer."
//OMG the Japanese have a word for being weak due to the heat of summer. I need to start using that (it's caused some minor delays already). 〜IX
//usually translated as 'summer fatigue' - Raide

[Taichi]
"We can't have that. You'll have to drink my special white juice to combat the heat."

I took out a water bottle.

[Misato]
"Thank you very much, Peke-kun."

She took the water bottle.
At first glance this special white juice is a mere lactose product, but it contains an ingredient with a wonderful hidden flavor.
//No...he didn't...seriously....?-Spin

[Miki]
"White juice?"

[Misato]
"Wh-what's that?"

[Taichi]
"Eh!?"

I looked up at the sky.
What was that? A UFO? Adamski?

[Misato]
............*gulp* *gulp* *gulp* *gulp*

[Taichi]
"There's nothing there."

[Misato]
"Fuuu, thank you for the drink!"

The water bottle was returned empty.

[Taichi]
"......you drank it already?"

[Misato]
"Yes, by splitting it between the three of us."

[Miki]
"......eh? When was that?"

[Taichi]
"Hahahaha."

[Misato]
"Huhuhuhu."

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahahaha."

[Misato]
"Huhuhuhuhuhuhu."

That's good, that's good.

[Miki]
"Umm......it looked to me like you just poured it out......"

Mimi-sempai embraced Miki.

[Miki]
"Mugugugugu!!"

Guarding the beautiful breasts.

[Taichi]
"......poured out?"

[Misato]
"Now then, please look at this! Most of the preparations are complete!"

I was taken aside.

[Taichi]
"Ha, haa?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, you know..."

[Kiri]
"Yes? What is it?"

[Miki]
"......it's nothing."

[Kiri]
"?"

A conversation behind me.
It bugged me a little, but my consciousness immediately faced the tent.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Rabaa."

[Sakuraba]
"Rabaa. In other words, a lover."
//Think this is justified for the noobs? 〜IX

Sakuraba was under the tent.
(TL Note: Since Japanese imitates the English "l" with an "r" and the "v" with a "b," the word "lover" does in fact sound like "rabaa" to them.)

[Taichi]
"Where's Tomoki?"

[Sakuraba]
"The siscon got aggravated and returned home."

[Taichi]
"......is that so?"

[Sakuraba]
"He did get the wiring together though. That guy's a worker."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

Well, if they've gotten this far then there's no need to worry.

[Misato]
"Shall we take a break? My throat's parched."

Sempai took out some canned tea from the mini-refrigerator.

[Taichi]
"......eh? You said your throat was parched?"

[Misato]
"See, the leftover batteries revive the conveniences of modern life."

It was a smaller fridge than the one in the club room.

[Taichi]
"Whoa..."

Must've been Tomoki.

[Misato]
"We haven't had cold drinks in a long time!"
[Misato]
"And here's yours."

[Taichi]
"That's great and all......but Sempai, about my white juice......"

[Misato]
"Cheeeeers!"

[Taichi]
"Ha, haa, cheers......indeed."

Maybe I hadn't brought enough white juice.
Even though it was a special drink with lemon juice mixed into a lactose beverage......
//Ahhh-Spin
Well, whatever.
We took a breather underneath the tent with shade and tea.

[Taichi]
"Fuiii, this really brings you back to life, Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"Right after you lost most of your moisture content."

[Kiri]
*cough* *cough!*
[Kiri]
"Sempai!!!"

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

[Miki]
"Were Sempai and Kiri peeing?"

[Taichi]
"Both of us standing. We wanted to know whose would fly the farthest."
//Now THAT'S a joke I would have made.-Spin

[Kiri]
"No we weren't!! We couldn't!!"

[Miki]
"Y-you did such a fun thing without telling me......"

[Kiri]
"Miki......that isn't fun at all......"

[Miki]
"Aaare youuu suuure?"

In recent years, Miki has been losing her modesty at a speed on par with deforestation, but she's fundamentally innocent.
......huh?

[Taichi]
"By the way Kiri-chin, if you move around that much we can all see it."

[Kiri]
"........................"

She pushed down on the edge of her skirt and became quiet.

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

[Sakuraba]
"By the way Taichi, about tomorrow's broadcast......President-sempai told me to, so I tried writing a manuscript."

[Taichi]
"Hooo, you of all people did such a thing?"

[Sakuraba]
"Please take a look. I want to hear your opinion."

[Taichi]
"......"

I couldn't read it.

[Taichi]
"......what language is this?"

[Sakuraba]
"On the off chance it got intercepted, I've given it multiple encryption so that it cannot be understood."

I hit him.

[Taichi]
"That's pointless!"

[Misato]
"......aaaaah, the time Sakuraba-kun spent is completely wasted......"

[Taichi]
"Why would you make an SOS incomprehensible!?"

Right then,

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

A wind chime rang.

[Taichi]
"Isn't that a wind chime?"

[Sakuraba]
"......I put it up."
[Sakuraba]
"Since it seems everyone's going to be mating here from now on, I thought it was a good idea."

[Taichi]
"............uu."
(TL Note: The word translated here as "mating" can refer either to animals having intercourse or to people hanging out.)

Once in a while he does clever things.
Humanity disappeared.
We don't know if there's any hope left.
And yet, he's truly......a carefree guy.

[Taichi]
"And mate we shall."
//now THAT was fun to tl. 〜IX

[Sakuraba]
"Indeed."
//and that 〜IX
//I approve of this new plot development - Sheeta

[Misato]
"......please do."

[Taichi]
"Forever and ever."

Sempai lowered her eyes happily.

[Miki]
"Even so, Kiri-chin isn't that lively."

[Kiri]
"R-really? That's not true at all."
//alternate adaptations welcome 〜IX

[Taichi]
"......"

Maybe she really is forcing herself.
Did truth and actions overburden Kiri?
//yes, he's being that vague about what the "actions" were 〜IX
But,
The world has only one day left.
I have no possibilities or means to heal Kiri.
That's why,
That's why---
