[Taichi]
"Yes-yeees."
[Taichi]
"Who might you be?"

[Yuusa]
"Uh, umm, I'm Doujima."

[Taichi]
"That cute voice hiding underneath a gangster-like surname......Yuusa-chan? It's open, come in."

The door opened timidly, and a pretty girl was standing there.

[Yuusa]
"Good eveni......ng."

I sat her down and served her wheat tea.
We talked about a lot of things.

[Yuusa]
"Umm, today's my birthday."

[Taichi]
"Oooh? It was today?"

[Yuusa]
"About that, this is......my birthday present."

[Taichi]
"Ummm......anyway, thanks. But, why?"

[Yuusa]
"Also, I thought the exchange diary was due tomorrow, so......"

[Taichi]
"So here's your exchange diary, and on top of that, a birthday present from me."

[Yuusa]
"............"

This girl is always at a loss for words when she's surprised.

[Taichi]
"Now then, why don't I walk you back home?"

[Yuusa]
"........................!!!?"

She was at an even worse loss for words than before.

[Taichi]
"It's already nighttime, so there are quite a few dangerous people out there."

Especially in this town.

[Taichi]
"Shall we go?"

[Yuusa]
"Y-yes!"

Then, I walked her home.

[Yuusa]
"You always ask that question, don't you, Taichi-san?"
[Yuusa]
"That's too hard for me to really understand, but......okay."
[Yuusa]
"It's training."

It's training.
Training...
Homesickness?
No.
(TL Note: "Training" and "homesickness" are both pronounced "kyoushuu.")
Assault.
Assault.
(TL Note: So is this word, if you get creative enough with certain kanji.)
Yes, assault.
To attack intensely.
Yeah.
I like that word.
I laughed in my dreams.
Without stopping.
Ridicule.
Sunken emotions are soon consumed by the abyss.
The gilding which reminds me of the void of cynicism melts, and the now-bare fragments......mix into an enormous nucleus, and jest.
One thought.
Enemies are enemies.
I'll kill them if I must.
