As I returned from the bathroom,
I bumped into Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"Tomokiiiii."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha, I ended up cutting class. These hallways feel like their own little world during class time."

[Tomoki]
"Stop that, it's futile......"

Tomoki seemed dejected.

[Taichi]
"Our negotiations have truly stalled."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi, you really are easygoing."
[Tomoki]
"I can't read Saikoman anymore."

A dry laugh.

[Taichi]
"......I see."

I can no longer read ahead of him and tell him what happens next.

[Tomoki]
"So, what'd you come to school for?"

[Taichi]
"For one like myself who possesses an Innocence License, I am autonomically drawing out my mental void by repeating such forces of habit as going to school, for the sole purpose of acting out the subtleties of a fragile teenage heart left behind in the world."

[Tomoki]
"That thought's full of radical teenage ideas."
[Tomoki]
"There are still a lot of hot-blooded Koshieners out there."

[Taichi]
"Ah, to the people calling themselves post-modern, those Koshieners would be seen as humans who aren't worth observing."
(TL Note: This is a reference to fans of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, which plays in the Hanshin Koshien Stadium.)

I flapped my hands.

[Tomoki]
"Ahahahaha, you really said that."

[Taichi]
"Don't you mean, 'Wahahahaha?'"

Dark humor.
Sharp-tongued Tomoki likes that stuff.

[Tomoki]
"Thanks Taichi, I haven't laughed in a while."

[Taichi]
"It is a pleasure to be of service."
[Taichi]
"How's the club?"

[Tomoki]
"It's doing well, now that the Grand King of Snack Stealing is no longer participating."
//Noticing how we've capitalized a lot of other similar things, might as well do this as well.-Spin

[Taichi]
"......hahaha..."

He means me.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi's ought to be ready by tomorrow."
//This line was so vague in Japanese I'm not actually sure if I was right in assuming he means the club. QC people will have to check if this is the day before the broadcast. 〜IX
//In any case, this isn't good for an adaptation. Once we decide what he's actually saying (I think he means Taichi's script should be prepared for tomorrow), we can adapt accordingly. - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"Understood. Thank you."

[Tomoki]
"No problem."
[Tomoki]
"Friendship asks for-"

[Taichi]
"Nothing at all."

We both presented sultry smiles, white teeth and raised thumbs.

[Tomoki]
"About that......"
[Tomoki]
"Will you be coming to our club?"

[Taichi]
"No, my participation was denied since I'm the Grand King of Snack Stealing......and I believe you're the one who renounced me."
//Too many "refused."-Spin

[Tomoki]
"No, it wasn't me."

For a moment, he hesitated to say it.

[Tomoki]
"......it was from the roof."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, so it was Mimimi-sempai..."
[Taichi]
"Yeah, she doesn't come that much......a lot happened."
//This one's also vague, in that I can't tell where she isn't going a lot. Due to the piecemeal nature of these scripts, I can't tell if it's a valid statement to make about the broadcasting club with Taichi. Again, we'll have to debate this one later. 〜IX

[Tomoki]
"I see......"
[Tomoki]
"Well, that might be for the best."
[Tomoki]
"......yeah, for the best."

Tomoki turned around and walked away.
He was acting strange.
I wonder why...
