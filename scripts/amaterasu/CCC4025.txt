Now then,
I went to the roof and took care of Tomoki's body.
I'll get that antenna out of him......well, I tried to, but it was fixed in place.

[Taichi]
"Damn uptight guy."

Literally.
I tried to sit him in a chair, but he was fixed in place.
(TL Note: The Japanese word for "uptight person" is written with the kanji for "hard/rigid person/thing".)

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

With no other choice, I grabbed his ankles and stomped on his shoulders, forcing him horizontal.
I heard a cracking noise.
Sorry, Tomoki's corpse.
By now, would this be a soulless Tomoki?
I stood the horizontal Tomoki up by the fence.

[Taichi]
"Okay, Tomoki. Now you're part of the club too. We'll do it with just the two of us!"

Tomoki's Corpse: "............"
No reaction. Like a dead body.
Well, he is a dead body......
The antenna had been breaking apart.
Yes, now I can tell.
Tomoki had tried to destroy the antenna.
He had quite a grudge for Misato-sempai......for Aneki.
He interfered with her.
And then the broken antenna......Tomoki......
Sempai came to the roof and saw her brother's corpse.
And then......she fell.
Tomoki was killed by coincidence.

[Taichi]
"It's totally your fault that the antenna got so short."

Tomoki's Corpse: "............"

[Taichi]
"Not talking? Are you the sullen type?"

Now then,
Now that I've enjoyed talking to Tomoki's corpse, I'll start the club.
I adjusted the height of the mike.
Power on.
The frequency......maybe it's best not to touch it.
Well, it should be fine.
I'm pretty sure......if I do this......there we go.
Begin broadcast.

[Taichi]
"Ummm......"
[Taichi]
"Nnn, what should I do..."

I thought.
I'm apolitical, without any particular opinions.
Nnn.
Okay!

[Taichi]
"Eeeh, this is......the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Channel......the channel name is......eeeh......Red Scorpio, let's go with that. I would like to prick you repeatedly."
[Taichi]
"Today, we have Dead Tomoki-san as a guest from the land of the dead."

Tomoki's Corpse: "............"

[Taichi]
"He's a cool, shy boy."
[Taichi]
"Eeeh..."
[Taichi]
"Anyway, is anyone alive out there?"
[Taichi]
"......if you are, how should I put this, please live."
[Taichi]
"Please live until you die."
[Taichi]
"There really are many valuable things that are only possible when one is living, right Dead Tomoki-san?"

Tomoki's Corpse: "............"

[Taichi]
"He's an attractive, taciturn guy."
[Taichi]
"Well, it's okay if you die, but......"
[Taichi]
"I think human relationships might be more precious than any of us realize."
[Taichi]
"We make ourselves with influence from others."
[Taichi]
"I've felt that firsthand, but what about you?"
[Taichi]
"It's okay if you can live on by yourself......if you have that kind of strength."
[Taichi]
"But I think most people are weak."
[Taichi]
"If I really became alone, I'm sure I'd break."
[Taichi]
"Even though the world's full of malice,"
[Taichi]
"There may not be much else, but,"
[Taichi]
"......even so, someone's here."
[Taichi]
"Someone other than yourself."
[Taichi]
"That's---"

[Miki]
"Humans are okay as long as they have themselves. Right, Sempai?"

I stopped.
I looked.
Miki.

[Taichi]
"Miki......?"

[Miki]
"I went and secured the notebook."

[Taichi]
"But, wait......?"
[Taichi]
"Do you have enough time?"

[Miki]
"It's coming pretty soon."

[Taichi]
"Isn't that bad? You need to hurry back-"

She was drenched in sweat.
Had she come back here running?
For what purpose?

[Miki]
"......aah, I don't think I'd make it if I went back now."

[Taichi]
"What are you doing? Hurry up and go!"

[Miki]
"I will go once I'm done here. I'm the type to care really deeply about myself."

[Taichi]
"Done with what?"

Her expression neatly braced itself.

[Miki]
"Sempai, this world......it's not the world we were in."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Miki]
"Please read this. It's the easiest way for you to understand."

Miki took out a bulky diary notebook.

[Miki]
"From page fifty-two."

I tried reading.

[Date]
--/--

It's been about a month since the large-scale 'spiriting away' was confirmed.
Those people disappeared in a flash.
When did they disappear?
How did they disappear?
No one saw the moment when they disappeared.
Humanity didn't have the time to clarify the cause.
The population of Upper Misaka City is now less than half of what it was.
The number of students has decreased.
The student called Kurosu is the same as ever.
He's living as noisily as always in this crisis of a situation.
He was one of the more serious ones, but he looked perfectly healthy. It's truly ironic.
When will I disappear?

[Date]
--/--

Classes can now be joined at will.
Nothing can be done about there being only a tenth of the students that there used to be.
I just play with figurines at my house.
However, they can't see, nor can they love.
It's no more than self-satisfaction.
Good thing my family's gone.
It doesn't seem like I'll be able to endure my family's disappearance.
The power plant was brought to a halt after all. It's only natural.

[Date]
--/--

I disposed of the figurines.
Just because people are gone, hobbies have become meaningless.
I can't get in the mood to do anything.
'The world is stable.'
That fact was connected to the enjoyment of hobbies.
Even I, who hated people, was connected to the world.
Through ventilation I was still barely living.
Food can be provided somehow, since the number of mouths to feed has decreased.
Cases of barter increased.
I want to eat steak so badly.

[Date]
--/--

Even when I head into town, I don't see many people.
Is anyone still alive?
I started wandering around.
The television no longer functioned.
The radio only has static, so I can't hear a thing.
It's quiet. I feel like I'll go crazy.

[Date]
--/--

I didn't see anyone today.

[Date]
--/--

A delivery truck came.
But it had no driver.
I searched all around, but there was no one.
Only the truck with its engine running was left.
Scary. I'm scared.

[Date]
--/--

I borrowed the resources in the truck.
Tons of bread.
But I don't need curry bread.
I brought what I wanted to my house in several trips.
I brought the case of curry bread to the school cafeteria.
If anyone's left alive, they'll eat it.

[Date]
--/--

I didn't meet anyone today.

[Date]
--/--

Is there anyone here......?

[Date]
--/--

I met Yamanobe Miki.
I was jubilant.
But Yamanobe was afraid. She wouldn't have anything to do with me.
She was saying something about Kurosu.
Kurosu is dangerous? I don't understand.
Yamanobe ran away.
I searched for her through the night, but I couldn't find her.

[Date]
--/--

Yamanobe died. What a thing to happen...
She was killed. By someone.
Kurosu? Is this what she meant when she said Kurosu was dangerous?
It's true that Kurosu was a seriously unadaptive person, but...
There was some kind of cause.
I want to meet someone.
I think I'll try searching for Kurosu tomorrow.
Anyone's fine.
The diary cut off here.

[Taichi]
"......this...is Sakakibara's diary?"

[Miki]
"When I investigated various things a while back......I found this."
[Miki]
"This is a different world."
[Miki]
"It's a similar, but different world."
[Miki]
"......an empty world without the original residents."
[Miki]
"We were thrown into it. Probably, on the way home from that campout......"

My heart jumped.
On the way home from the campout.
Then...then---
These eyes have---

[Taichi]
"......where was it?"

[Miki]
"They're in most people's houses. But that one's the easiest to understand."
[Miki]
"This means there are other Sempais and other mes besides those in this world."
[Miki]
"So, Sakakibara-sensei was probably killed."
[Miki]
"Because a hallway in the Institute was covered in blood."

[Taichi]
"......I...did it?"

[Miki]
"The Sempai of this world."

[Taichi]
"I......"

[Miki]
"Of this world!"

[Taichi]
"But, it was me."

I dropped the diary.

[Taichi]
"I'm so worthless---"

[Miki]
"You're fine."

I was embraced.

[Miki]
"So, calm down."

I held her too.
The small Miki gave me a huge relief.

[Taichi]
"......the worlds...are crossing, aren't they?"

That crossing point was this one-week world.
Such absurdity......like sci-fi.
But,

[Taichi]
"......did you come back here just to tell me that?"

[Miki]
"Yes......"

[Taichi]
"Isn't it meaningless?"

[Miki]
"That's true. I just noticed."

[Taichi]
"......that's a lie."

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Are you an idiot?"

[Miki]
"But......"
[Miki]
"I loved you."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"I love Sempai......and had sex with him......"
[Miki]
"I fell in love with this Sempai!"

She clung to me. Tightly.

[Miki]
"With...this Sempai."
[Miki]
"I didn't know......that falling in love with someone......"
[Miki]
"I didn't think...it would hurt this much!"
[Miki]
"My chest......it's tightening..."
[Miki]
"Tears are coming out."
[Miki]
"I'm sniffling."
[Miki]
"I'm making an unsightly face, and my heart is beyond control."
[Miki]
"It's not logical."
[Miki]
"......you're warm."

[Taichi]
"I'm glad to hear that......but didn't you like Kiri-chin?"

[Miki]
"I think......I like her."
[Miki]
"But, she broke......"
[Miki]
"I killed Kiri-chin several times."
[Miki]
"In order for me to live......Kiri was the only one who could pull away the scary Sempai's awareness."

So she could catch me by surprise.

[Miki]
"Hasekura-sempai and Taichi-sempai. I had to live on desperately despite those two monsters."

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry."

[Miki]
"......I'm tired."
[Miki]
"I don't...want to......kill anymore."
[Miki]
"That's......not an easy thing......"
[Miki]
"Each time I kill Kiri-chin, my entire heart cracks."
[Miki]
"......that memory has recurred several times...... I've held it......and lived on......that's......that is..."

She spat it out.

[Miki]
"Hell."
[Miki]
"That's why......I've......decided."
[Miki]
"......I'll forget...everything."

She echoed proudly.
Her resolve made her words noble.

[Taichi]
"......Miki's a good girl."

[Miki]
"I'm broken......and I didn't think of people as people......"

[Taichi]
"You're better than me."
[Taichi]
"Miki's got a long way to go before becoming a worthless monster like me."

[Miki]
"......"

With words,
I tried beating on Miki's heart.
As if knocking.
Softly.

[Taichi]
"Miki has no skill."

[Miki]
"Ahaha......hahaha......"
[Miki]
"That's...right......hahaha......ha......uua......"

She smiled with a teary voice.

[Taichi]
"......that three-person date was fun, wasn't it?"

[Miki]
"Yes......"

[Taichi]
"Living by yourself got lonely, didn't it?"

[Miki]
"......that's not true at all. I care about myself the most."

[Taichi]
"That's also a lie."
[Taichi]
"Even though......I finally understand that."

It would never have happened.
In order to become a more noble version of myself, what sort of sacrifices would I make?
Miki did nothing more than that.
I suddenly started wanting to continue existing with Miki.

[Taichi]
"......let's go to the hokora. If we use a car---"

[Miki]
"It's too late."

Then, suddenly,
The sky grew dark.

[Taichi]
"!?"

[Miki]
"It's started......"

The Miki that had been maintained until now,
The Miki that had been built up,
Would be reset.
Really.
The world really is being rolled back.
That's......an excerpt of Miki's subjective time. In other words,
This means a partial disappearance.
Miki was shaking.
In my arms.
Terror.
That's right.
Miki's terror should be heavier than mine.
It's natural for her to be afraid.
I pushed her head into my chest.

[Miki]
"I'm scared...would you please keep holding me?"

[Taichi]
"Relax. I'm pretty scared too."

[Miki]
"The memory of this conversation...will disappear with everything else......"

I patted her back with the hands I held her with.

[Taichi]
"Don't think about that so much."

[Miki]
"Eeuua......"

[Taichi]
"How will we disappear?"

[Miki]
"Only those who've experienced it would know."

[Taichi]
"That's true."

[Miki]
"What do you think happened to Sakuraba-sempai?"

[Taichi]
"Inside me, he's already set as dead."

[Miki]
"Another loveless thing to say......"

[Taichi]
"Don't you say that!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha."

It was just like an everyday conversation.

[Taichi]
"Seriously...damn this world for doing it so thoughtlessly."

[Miki]
"Hey, Taichi-sempai."

[Taichi]
"What is it, my girl?"

[Miki]
"I love you."

Those became the last words I heard.
