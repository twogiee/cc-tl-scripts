The roof.
I came, I saw, I was surprised.
//I definitely got a Caesar gist from this line. - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"......it looks......"

[Touko]
"Finished......"

The antenna.
The wiring.
Even a tent and a live broadcasting seat had been prepared.

[Taichi]
"Sempai did this all by herself?"

But Sempai wasn't there.

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Touko, while you were indulging in sex, Sempai was continuing a healthy and forward-looking club."

[Touko]
"Wh-why am I the only bad guy......"
//That's the saying.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, still, this really is a surprise."

[Touko]
"......Miyasumi-sempai...I wonder if she's here."

[Taichi]
"I can't see her."

Maybe she's taking a break since it's Saturday?
But wasn't the pilot broadcast for the Gunjou community FM channel planned for tomorrow?
Then,
Touko signaled toward something far away with her hand.
//If she's pointing, consider that term - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"What?"

We approached it.

[Touko]
"Here she is."

[Taichi]
"Ah......"

[Misato]
"......suyaaa."

She's sleeping.

[Taichi]
"She's been doing this all by herself."

Because of that, Sempai seemed a little worse for wear.
Her glasses were crooked.
Her uniform was coming apart.

[Taichi]
"......"

I moved my nose closer and confirmed the smell.

[Taichi]
"There's a slightly bittersweet, sweaty smell fr---"

[Touko]
"Stop that."

She sounded serious.

[Taichi]
"Oouu."

I felt like I was about to have a concussion.

[Touko]
"You musn't take such interest in the many smells of a girl."

The phrase 'many smells of a girl' is unacceptable to begin with.
//Haha, I edited the above line before seeing this! - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"Question."

I raised my hand.

[Touko]
"Yes, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Touko, you've never farted in front of me, so where do you do it? And how conscious are you of this evasion?"

[Touko]
"Whatever do you mean?"

She said it.

[Taichi]
"......you've gotten stronger."

[Touko]
"What a weird thing to say."

Oooh, Touko's letting sexual harassment flow over her......
I'm moved.

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu."

[Touko]
"Huhuhu."

We laughed invincibly like a pair of rivals.

[Misato]
"......nyamu......"

[Taichi]
"Ah, she's awake."

So a weird confrontation in the sky above can wake her up.

[Taichi]
"Hello, Sempai. I'm Taichi."

[Misato]
"......aaeh......Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"It's me, your one and only Taichi."
//I know this was another rewrite but I couldn't think of a way to fix the old line. It sounded pretty weird.-Spin

I didn't worry about Touko's amazingly angry stare.
//Otherwise put a comma in since it's two adjectives altering one noun. - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"If you tell me to suck something, I shall suck it. Now, go ahead and order me to suck."

[Touko]
"Taaaiiiichiii!"

[Taichi]
"Uoooo."

The iron claw on the back of my head really hurts.
But I can endure!

[Misato]
"Umm......why are you here?"

[Taichi]
"......yes, we came to see Sempai's beautiful sleeping face."

[Touko]
"Remember this."

Touko whispered behind me.

[Taichi]
"But that's just a joke, we came to see how things were going."

[Misato]
"How things were going..."

[Taichi]
"It looks like most of it's ready."

[Misato]
"Y-yeah."

[Touko]
"......umm, Miyasumi-sempai, did you do this by yourself?"

[Misato]
"Yes......because..."

Sempai swallowed the rest of those words.
For a while, indecision itself was stuck to her cheeks.
Which is why I knew how she wanted to say it.

[Misato]
"Because, it's my job."

[Taichi]
"Your job. That means it's also my job."

I took her hand.
And kissed the back of it.

[Misato]
"Umm......"

[Touko]
"............"

Ha!?

[Taichi]
"Hey, we don't want the Harakiri Blade here!"
//Something just sounded missing.-Spin

There's a storm!?

[Misato]
"Kya! What happened all of a sudden?"

[Taichi]
"It's because of......that blade's several hundred year history of sucking people's blood, which built up a calamitous deep-seated grudge!"
//Sounds more like a Muramasa blade than Masamune even though he was narrating for some reason awhile back.-Spin

[Touko]
"......abtor, damral, omnis, nomnis."

Sh-she's chanting some kind of unlucky spell, she is!!
(TL Note: This is a spell used by the main character in Osamu Tezuka's Mitsume ga Tooru or The Three-Eyed One.)

[Taichi]
"Stooop!! Stooop!!"

[Touko]
"Destroy alongside me......"

[Taichi]
"No more double suicides!!!"
[Taichi]
"Okay, okay, calm down. Aren't we too close for that?"

[Touko]
"......that's true......"

So she did understand.

[Touko]
"We're close enough for you to think you can go woo another woman without worrying about me......"

[Taichi]
"Howawa!"

[Touko]
"It's okay. Be at ease."

She smiled.

[Touko]
"This blade cuts very well, so it should cut away all your worldly desires."

[Taichi]
"Th-that's only possible in a Kikuchi ****yuki novel!"

[Touko]
"......flirtatious......deceptive......stallion... erotic beast......pervert......seducer......lecherous... nymphomanic......"
//You have a line break in here, and an odd space before erotic that looks like it's there for line break purposes. I would select one to keep and one to go. - pondrthis
(TL Note: Kikuchi Hideyuki is a light novelist most famous for the Vampire Hunter D series.)

[Taichi]
"Ah, aaaaah."

All of these erotic sins are mine!
//Another line I like. 〜IX
//Made it even better, and I agree on 'nymphomania' - Sheeta

[Misato]
"Glasses, my glasses......"

While I was being hit by a dazzling crisis of life and death, Sempai was focusing on her glasses.
Uwaaa, videotape the whole thing!
But I'll die!
My desire to tape and my life preservation instincts fought one another.
......I wanna tape it!
My taping desire won.
But what do I do with that?

[Taichi]
"Ku! I can't die here!"

I held Touko's shoulders.
A desperate measure. No, a lustful measure.

[Taichi]
"Touko, I-I-I-I-I love-"

[Touko]
"Eh!?"

*kiss*

[Touko]
"Nnn! Nn! Nnmu!......nn!......afu!......ann...... ......nn......nnnnn......yan, no tongue......aauun...... uu! *lick*......yau, no biting......noooo......"

A super deep kiss.
More like mouth sex.

[Misato]
"Hawahawa. Glasses, my glasses."

Tape iiit!
But now I must focus on my tongue.

[Touko]
"Amu!......nn!......nnnnn, nnu......! ......aau, ah, yamun......I said, no, tongue......nn......*kiss* ......*lick!*......"

[Misato]
"Hawahawahawa. I can't see. I can't see."

Kissing and glasses.

[Touko]
"Nnu......*kiss*......aamun, nn! Nnn......Taihiii ......aan, your, saliva......aan, okay, I'll drink it, so don't tickle......nn! Nn! Nn! *gulp* nnku, nnnnnnn...... fua, I can't drink it all......aan......"

[Misato]
"Hin! I can't find them..."

[Continuation]
kissing and glasses.

[Touko]
"Erun, nn! *kiss* *kiss!*......stop, I'll, also ......Taichi, your tongue......nn, *kiss* *kiss*...... nnnnnnn......"

[Misato]
"Ah!......no, these are fake party glasses...... not these, where are they......"

Continuation of continuation: kissing and glasses.

[Touko]
"Aan! No fingers......heeey......ah! Fuan, nna ......nn! I get it, I'll suck them......aamu......nn! *kiss* *kiss* nn! Nn! Nn!"
//Translate - pondrthis

[Misato]
"Muu. What are these? Ah, the night vision goggles I use in the evenings......"
//Well, that's one mystery solved. 〜IX

Again and again: kissing and glasses.

[Touko]
"......ya......nnn, nnmu!......nna......*kiss* *kiss!*...... fuan! Don't suck so...so haaaard......nn! Nnmumu!"
[Touko]
"Nnn! Nnn! Nn......nnuuuuu! Nn!............ nnnnnnnnnn------!!!!!"

*plop*
Did she cum?
Touko fell limp in my arms.

[Misato]
"Ah, here they are!"
[Misato]
"And, equip."

*ching*
//The romaji was "shakiiin" if anyone wants to come up with a better English equivalent here. 〜IX
The revival of Mimimi-sempai.

[Misato]
"......Kirihara-san, what's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"She seems to have a cold."

[Misato]
"Her face...it's red. And she's sweating."
[Misato]
"This is bad, her body is shaking!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, this is act......uuohon......it's action-reaction."

[Misato]
"......action-reaction?"
[Misato]
"Is that a serious illness?"

[Taichi]
"It's nothing to worry about."
[Taichi]
"Weeell, it'd be nice if we could find some dark matter."
//Is the action-reaction an RPG reference? The equip was, for sure... And dark matter is FF at least... Otherwise I don't get this. - pondrthis

[Misato]
"......?"
[Misato]
"Shouldn't you have Hasekura-san look into that?"

[Taichi]
"You're right. I'll bring her home with me."

I picked her up on my back.

[Touko]
"......nn!......Tai...chi......"

I can't stand the hot breath against my ears.
Returning home would be the end......I predicted a non-stop fever.
Before I went downstairs, I turned around.
Sempai was still standing right there.

[Taichi]
"Uh, ummm?"

[Misato]
"Y-yes?"

[Taichi]
"......is it okay if I participate in the club tomorrow?"

Sempai's eyes magnified slightly.

[Taichi]
"I'll bring this with me."

I pointed to Touko with my jaw.

[Misato]
"Ah......yes, feel free......"

[Taichi]
"Then we'll be there."

I passed the threshold.

[Misato]
"Ah! Umm..."

She called me back.

[Taichi]
"Uui?"
//Oui?! - pondrthis

She seemed to return to her senses when I said that, and her face turned desperate.

[Misato]
"F-feel free!......"
[Misato]
"Feel free!"

She said it again.
In a loud voice.
And I answered her.

[Taichi]
"Roger!"
