"Uu......"

I woke up.
I'd been sleeping on my desk.
I'd been dreaming.
A dream that should have been nostalgic.
But it put me in a melancholic mood.
In the end, people are living for their own sake.
Yielding many contacts with other people, within various desires.
To cool off my sweaty body, I headed for the roof.
