But now there is the club.
Sempai's sketches.
I will believe that resolving the problems on this list of tears will produce a structure capable of dispatch.
I will believe in Sempai.
Believe. That's a beautiful word.
It can quench my thirst quite a bit.
Begin work.
I continue working under the boiling sun.
I'm fantastically strong against sunstroke.
Because my hair is white.
Just that, makes a significant difference.
So even on a midsummer's day, the work continued.
Without pause.

[Taichi]
"......nn?"

Isn't that Kiri?
Standing next to the fence, gazing at the scenery.
Has she not noticed me?
She should have. This work makes a lot of loud noises.

[Taichi]
"Heeey, Kiriii!"

I called her,
Then walked over at a comfortable pace.

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Well......I didn't have anything in particular......"

Kiri glanced up at the antenna as if she had no interest in it.

[Kiri]
"......you're really working for the club."

[Taichi]
"Well, yeah."
[Taichi]
"Although this heat makes me want to go to the beach."
[Taichi]
"We went last year. Do you remember that?"

[Kiri]
"......yes."

[Taichi]
"That was fun. Though I'm sorry about Miki."

[Kiri]
"......yes."

She's too honest.
Actually, she's acting weird.

[Taichi]
"......what is it?"

[Kiri]
"Well......Hasekura-sempai is......"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan's......watching you?"

[Kiri]
"Y-yes......"

Kiri's hands were shaking.
Even though she was such a tough girl.
She's afraid.
She was shrinking miserably.

[Kiri]
"About that..."
[Kiri]
"About that......"

Her voice was shaking.
I can't watch this.
Even though she was a girl like beautiful glasswork,
Even though she was so fragile that touching her would defile her, and grabbing her would break her,
This......incomplete being, what is it?
I felt hatred for Youko-chan.
Aaah, I'm sinking again, I thought.
Times are good when I can be maintained by raising tension.
At other times, my heart sinks.
A deep part.
An abyss where even the sun can't reach.
A place that makes me forget the warmth of light, turning me into an individual that does nothing but live.
A place where that which is called a heart is unneeded.
If I stay there too long, my frozen heart will eventually degenerate into a pure will to live.
I had a hallucination that I was an existence living in the deep sea.
I thought that was good.
Because, if the world was me and only me, then,
I wouldn't have to hurt anyone.

[Taichi]
"......Kiri, help me with the club."

That sudden idea made circles out of Kiri's eyes.

[Kiri]
"The club?"

[Taichi]
"That's right."
[Taichi]
"......I won't be able to finish......on my own......please help me......"

The crying words passed on to me from Sempai, I now shoved them onto my underclassman.
I made Kiri work on top of the stepladder, so that I could expect the good fortune of seeing Pantyland founded.

[Taichi]
"Pantyland is great......"

[Kiri]
"Did you say something?"

[Taichi]
"This kind of antenna is called an E-type."

[Kiri]
"I heard something about a Pantyland..."

[Taichi]
"I said nothing of the sort."

I whistled.

[Kiri]
"......what...should I be doing?"

[Taichi]
"Aren't you helping me?"

[Kiri]
"Isn't that an order?"

[Taichi]
"......aaah, weeell, yeees, it iiis."

[Kiri]
"I want to pay back my debt in full, so I'm helping."

[Taichi]
"Yaaay."

[Kiri]
"However!"

She spoke with a strong enough tone to cut off my words and actions.

[Kiri]
"I have absolutely no intention of reconciling."

[Taichi]
"That's fine, that's fine."
[Taichi]
"That's yet another part of life."

[Kiri]
"Directions, please."

[Taichi]
"Hmm, theeen, first, please look at this."

I passed her a sketch.
Her face tightened up sharply.
One minute later, she frowned---
