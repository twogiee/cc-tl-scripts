I opened my eyes.
Sunlight pierced through the window.
I must have slept soundly. I didn't have a single dream.
The time is......seven o'clock.
There's no need to go to school.
My body moved anyway.
Breakfast hadn't been prepared.
Obviously.
Mutsumi-oba-san made being beautiful her career. She was also a great cook. But she was no longer here.
She'd taken me in.
And made a peaceful deal with Youko-chan......
I had plenty to be thankful for.
But before I could fulfill my filial duty, she'd disappeared.
There's no real food in the house.
I just drank water.
I met Yuusa-chan a lot on this road.
She really got attached to me.
She was a ticklish existence.
As much as I could, I was making great efforts.
Yuusa-chan's existence healed me well.
But now, she's not here.

[Sakuraba]
"Yo."

It was Sakuraba.

[Taichi]
"Yo."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"So am I."

[Sakuraba]
"You are too?"

[Taichi]
"I am."

[Sakuraba]
"That's painful."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, painful."
[Taichi]
"Right about now I'll rush into a normal home."

I crashed into a nearby residence.
I returned.

[Taichi]
"I caught a big catch."

There were lots of preservatives in it.

[Taichi]
"Behold, canned bread. It even has kompeitou in it."

[Sakuraba]
......*sniff*
(TL Note: "Kompeitou" are small Japanese sugar candies originally made in Portugal.)

Sakuraba was dripping snot.

[Taichi]
"......looks like evacuating was the right choice."

[Sakuraba]
"Now I wish for tissues."

[Taichi]
"There aren't any."

[Sakuraba]
"......mm. Then it can't be helped."

We started walking.
The icicle-shaped snot lightly danced from left to right.

[Taichi]
"Don't just say, 'it can't be helped!'"

I took out my handkerchief.

[Sakuraba]
"......sorry."

[Taichi]
"Don't return it. Absolutely do not return it. I'll kill you if you do."

[Sakuraba]
"I owe you a debt."

[Taichi]
"Do return that."

[Sakuraba]
"Yep."
