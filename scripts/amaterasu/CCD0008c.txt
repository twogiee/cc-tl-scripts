[Miki]
"Suempuaaai......"

A voice called to me from behind.

[Taichi]
"Miki......"

The corners of her eyes were red.
She'd cried her eyes out.

[Taichi]
"Uu, are you okay?"

[Miki]
"Somehow..."

[Taichi]
"So you're living toooo, Mikiii."

[Miki]
"This is baaaad."

The tension of this conversation is going under.

[Miki]
"Meals, and clothes, and television...what's going to happen to them?"
//I'm gonna assume that first "and" is put there for emphasis.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Well...it seems they'll all be reset, so..."

[Miki]
"Uueh?"

[Taichi]
"Well it'll work out somehow. Don't worry."

[Miki]
"......uuu."

She lost heart.

[Taichi]
"Cheer up. You're still my pupil."

[Miki]
"But......this is all strange......"

[Taichi]
"This world is strange."

[Miki]
"I'm anxious."

[Taichi]
"Liven up already."

[Miki]
"Pickled cake?"

Touch chest.
(TL Note: Homonyms again.)
*fu-nya*

[Miki]
"Fu-nya!?"

I fondled her frankly.
I extended a hand to her butt.
*mu-nyu*

[Miki]
"Uueah!!?"

Delicate. Soft. It felt good.
Fragile. Too fragile.

[Taichi]
"Detonation switch!"

I pushed the hook on her back.
Fingertips' pressure and vibration. I undid the hook in a single millisecond.
*slide*

[Miki]
"Naoooh!!?"

She held her breasts.
No bra is needed for that flat, boyish chest.
Single hook fishing......I'll skip that since I'd feel too sorry for her.

[Taichi]
"Final blow!"

*gabachooo!!*

[Miki]
"Nyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!??"

All the moves I sent out hit.
Miki was so unguarded it felt good.

[Taichi]
"Feeling better?"

[Miki]
"Yeees Iiii aaam!!"

She's mad.

[Taichi]
"Then all is well."

As a result I was also supplied with energy.

[Miki]
"I stick my tongue out at you!"

She stuck out her short tongue and ran off.

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."
