[Taichi]
"Aaah, I'll go too."

[Miki]
"......okay, thanks."

Was she anxious about going alone?
We held hands again.

[Miki]
"......why did this happen......?"

[Taichi]
"I don't know."

[Miki]
"Since there aren't any corpses, did everyone just vanish?"

[Taichi]
"Everyone might have gone away somewhere."

[Miki]
"Somewhere......"

[Taichi]
"Hey, there's the atomic plant. Maybe they evacuated."

[Miki]
"Meaning...it's dangerous here?"
//Better effect and also, the voice pauses there as well.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Well......I don't know."

[Miki]
"I don't think......that explains why radios and phones won't pick anything up."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you're right."

And, Kiri's house.
Miki and I each searched around half the house.

[Taichi]
"How'd it go?"

[Miki]
"She's not here."

[Taichi]
"Nor here."

Miki's shoulders fell.

[Taichi]
"We might have gone past her. Shall we go back to the school?"

[Miki]
"She should have used that road!"
[Miki]
"There's no way we'd just pass her......"

[Taichi]
"Maybe she came to school before us?"

[Miki]
"............"
[Miki]
"I'm sorry...I'll go...look for her!"

She raced off.

[Taichi]
"Ah, heeey!"
[Taichi]
"She's gone......"

After that, Miki continued searching for Kiri for three days.
After one day of investigation, Miki rejected all externalities.
And on the third day, she completely locked herself up.
However much I tried to persuade her, there was no sign of her coming out.
Her heart was already completely enveloped in despair.
......I've failed.
