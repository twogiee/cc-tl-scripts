"These scrapes and bruises don't matter anymore."

[Taichi]
"Eh, but you're hemorrhaging quite-?"

[Misato]
"I bleed more than this every month."

[Taichi]
"Bu-----!"

I performed a classic nosebleed.

[Misato]
"Kyaa!"

[Taichi]
"When one's childhood friend who happens to be a girl gets their menarche in a romance manga about that stuff, wouldn't there be or not be a few graphic scenes!!?"

My consciousness blacked out.
*plop*

[Misato]
"H-huh? Peke-kun?"
[Misato]
"Hey! Are you there!?"

Then,

[Taichi]
"......wha-?"

I woke up. A white room. The health room.
I'd been laid to rest on the bed.

[Taichi]
"That's right......Misato-sempai's menarche event occurred......"

*He's tragically mistaken

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

It looks like she put me on this bed.
With those slender arms.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, I've tasted shame!"

I buried my face in the pillow.

[Taichi]
"It smells like Sempai......"

Suuu-haaa-suuu-haaa
Suuu-haaa-suuu-haaa
(TL Note: These sound effects imply slow, deliberate and deep inhaling and exhaling.)
Suuu-haaa-suuu-haaa-suuu-haa-haa (*super hopeless person)
*Super and suuuhaaa are related, Madam!!
