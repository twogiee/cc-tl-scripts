Even in the evening, the ground was hot.
//If you want to speculate on what on Earth this scene means in the context of all humanity being annihilated, make sure you play all the current ccb scripts in game first. There are hints in the visuals. 〜IX
The heat penetrated the soles of my shoes.
But it wasn't unbearable.
Compared to the heat of a Kantou metropolis, clouds and dirt couldn't be more different.
After all, there's a nice breeze. I can handle this temperature.
That is, I could if I didn't have to keep climbing these hills.
The din of the cicadas only further amplified the heat.
Like a band that's only active during the summer, these guys stake everything on one season.

[Shinkawa]
"Gya!"
//PCP In cca0011c he's still called "boy." I won't bother labeling all the other lines of Shinkawa's dialogue with PCP tags, especially since it's the only difference between this scene and the week one version. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

Someone fell over nearby.
He made a dry sound against the ground, and stainless steel crutches fell down by his feet.

[Taichi]
"What's this?"

A person had collapsed.
I tried approaching him.

[Taichi]
"......umm, are you okay?"

[Shinkawa]
"Ah, sorry. I'm fine."

At times like these, Japanese people will always say they're fine.
I couldn't be sure whether that was true or not.
I lost my temper.

[Taichi]
"Are you really okay?! Can you really be sure you're fine in an instant like that?!"

[Shinkawa]
"Oh, oooh......aah."

This particular Japanese person felt pressured into nodding uncomfortably.

[Taichi]
"For all we know you could have multiple bone fractures!!"

[Shinkawa]
"I can tell by looking that it's not broken......"

[Taichi]
"I shall bring retribution down upon you for making light of humanity!"

[Shinkawa]
"What are you talking about?!"
[Shinkawa]
"Anyway, I'm not hurt at all."

He pulled himself up with a wry smile.
I handed him his crutches.

[Shinkawa]
"Ah, thanks."

[Taichi]
"Don't mention it. It's my fault, anyway."
[Taichi]
"Are you hurt?"

[Shinkawa]
"Doesn't seem like it."

Using his crutches, he managed to regain some of his balance.
One of his legs wasn't moving so well......

[Taichi]
"Broken leg?"

[Shinkawa]
"I wish it was."

A calm, carefree smile.
The face of a human who has toiled long and hard.

[Shinkawa]
"Huh, your......your hair..."

[Taichi]
"Aah, this?"

I pinched my own bangs.

[Taichi]
"It's no wig."

[Shinkawa]
"No, I didn't doubt that."
[Shinkawa]
"But did you dye it? It's white all the way to the root."

[Taichi]
"Nope, this is natural."

[Shinkawa]
"Wooow."
[Shinkawa]
"It's perfectly white."

That's right.
My hair has always been pure white.
A person once told me it was the color of down feathers.
Not the white of senility.
Snow white hair which keeps its luster.
White hair so natural it's slightly disturbing.
......that's the biggest reason I draw people's eyes.
The second biggest reason is the gap between that hair and my face. Dammit.

[Shinkawa]
"Ah, sorry. Does it bother you?"

But this guy was good.
He knows how to be considerate.
So I'll be considerate as well.

[Taichi]
"Oh no, not at all."
[Taichi]
"It used to, a bit. But since I'm in that school..."

[Shinkawa]
"Aah......Gunjou Institute?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Shinkawa]
"I'm a student there too."

He cracked a wide smile.

[Taichi]
"Oh, how old are you?"

The Japanese guy gave his date of birth.
He's the same age as me.
And maybe, a friend.

[Taichi]
"I hope we get along well."

[Shinkawa]
"Same here. Please teach me what you can."
[Shinkawa]
"One of my legs doesn't move very well."

[Taichi]
"......I see."

[Shinkawa]
"It's a mental thing. The wound healed ages ago."

[Taichi]
"That's a pain. Since when?"

[Shinkawa]
"Ages ago. It's perfectly natural."
[Shinkawa]
"Look, one's thicker than the other."

He rolled up his jeans, showing me both ankles.

[Taichi]
"Uwa, amazing."

[Shinkawa]
"Since I don't use it at all, the muscles just disappeared."

[Taichi]
"That's bad. Go train it."

[Shinkawa]
"I said it doesn't move well. I do still shift it manually sometimes though."
[Shinkawa]
"It's a real pain."

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey!"

[Shinkawa]
"Ahahaha, joking, joking."

[Taichi]
"So you're a wielder of self-deprecating gags."

I can't take this man's arrival lightly.

[Shinkawa]
"What do you mean?"
[Shinkawa]
"I hope that's a good school."

[Taichi]
"It's good."
[Taichi]
"For those like us."

[Shinkawa]
"That's great."

[Taichi]
"There are a lot of cute girls."

[Shinkawa]
"Seriously!?"

Though you can't hold a decent conversation with the majority of them.

[Taichi]
"Especially Machiko-sensei, she's the best."

[Shinkawa]
"Just the name's great! I wanna see her now..."

[Taichi]
"When we get the chance I'll let you see my treasured Machiko-sensei album."
[Taichi]
"It's rank A."

[Shinkawa]
"Rank A? Is that the highest?"

[Taichi]
"No, there's an S above it."

[Shinkawa]
"Uwa, the same rankings I use......"

[Taichi]
"Y-You too!?"

What's with this guy matching me so naturally?

[Shinkawa]
"Okay, I get the feeling this'll work somehow."

[Taichi]
"Gunjou is a magnanimous, delicious and erotic place."

[Shinkawa]
"Get out! Erotic!? A prosperous life has just opened up for me!!!"

[Taichi]
"Go for it!!!"

[Shinkawa]
"Ooooh, here I go!"
[Shinkawa]
"Come to think of it, this doesn't feel like our first meeting."

[Taichi]
"I also have a feeling that I'll need to settle a score with you someday."

[Shinkawa]
"And I'll accept the challenge."

He said with confidence.

[Shinkawa]
"......but before that, give me your data on Machiko-sensei."

[Taichi]
"Very well, comrade-in-arms."
[Taichi]
"We may not be of the same race, but I wish you good luck."

[Shinkawa]
"......no, you're definitely Japanese too."

This was how I met Shinkawa Yutaka---
