[Kiri]
"Are you okay?"

[Miki]
"......nn......I'm fine......"

Kiri's handkerchief wiped away Miki's tears.
They drew close to one another.
I couldn't get between them.
I walked ahead of them with the flashlight.
Why did Miki want to come here?
Why all three of us?
Why did she cry?
......there's no doubt that there's a lot going on with Miki.
Well, it's all within her own privacy.
That's right, the hokora was near here.
I guess I'll take a look.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, I'm going to take a bit of a detour......"

I handed her the flashlight.

[Taichi]
"See you later."

[Kiri]
"Eh?......Ah, wait."

[Miki]
"Ah, that way is......it's dange......"

And then I,

[Taichi]
"I finally came."

I showed my deep emotion using a word with no "ra".

[Taichi]
"Gyaaa."
(TL Note: For the verb "to come," all the forms which use the letter "ra" in Japanese would be some form of "to not come".)

My legs bent. I turned upside down.
I quickly extended the Lupin wire on my belt and wrapped it around a branch......it'd look cool if I could do that, but I just fell over normally.
It's best to fall right over in these situations.
Passively.

[Taichi]
"......nn?"

I looked closely at the ground.
Footprints.
There were several belts of footprints overlapping as they neared the hokora.
This is what happens when you come back and forth to the same place dozens of times.
I tried investigating the shoeprints themselves.
The size is at least twenty-seven.
The same as mine.
Probably the same maker.

[Taichi]
"............"

The same shoes as me.
Not Tomoki's shoes.
Not Sakuraba's.
There shouldn't be a girl with size twenty-sevens.
I have a general grasp on everyone's bodily data, so there's no mistaking it.
Either I've lost part of my memory, or someone used my shoes to make these.
But, what am I supposed to do at the hokora?
At the moment I tried to absorb myself in thought---

[Taichi]
"......!"

I smelled blood.
A faint ferrous odor.
It pulled me closer, and I parted the undergrowth.
It signaled danger.
I pulled out a knife from the Taichi Bag.
A large Chris Reeve knife.
It's nearly a short sword.
Of course, possession is a crime,
But the concept of crime was gone.
I was also prohibited from owning one.
But,
Although I won't admit it, I need this in order to protect myself.
Because I know the terror of being continuously attacked by people.
I cleared my ears.
I sharpened my senses.
I walked slowly.
I could only search via the feeling that something was wrong.
There it was.
The incongruity won't escape my eyes.
I took a prudent detour and closed in on the base of the tree.
......a bow trap?
It used a small crossbow.
It'll trigger if I try to go in deeper.
It hasn't triggered yet.
I could only think of one person who might do this.
I severed the wire and removed the crossbow bolt.
It had been concealed quite carefully.
It was set up in a great location.
Right in front of the pedestal, where I could barely see it.
Lowering my guard here would equal death.
Traps which insidiously desired certainty.
Why don't we confirm what's inside, Youko-sensei?
I continued a little further, and there was another wire trap set up.
It was a snare. If my leg was caught, a rock would fall from above.
Destruction.
The danger signal weakened.
Does that mean there aren't any more?
Even so, I continued on cautiously.
When I passed the last patch of grass, I saw Youko-chan's body, and that someone had tried to hide her.

[Taichi]
"........................"

How should I describe this emotion?
It's different from astonishment.
It's different from rage.
It's not sadness or sorrow.
An indescribable torrent.
Swirling around inside me.
Youko-chan...died.
Blood had spread out from the core of her chest.
Old blood.
It had hardened, changed color and was now black.
I touched it. It was cold.
A few days after her death. She'd stiffened up.
But there was no sign of decomposition.
That's also strange, but......well, I'll leave that aside.

[Taichi]
"......Youko-chan...did you die?"

I started talking to the beautiful corpse.
Even though she should have been the farthest from death.
I straightened her hair.

[Taichi]
"You were careless, weren't you?"

However, there was no answer.
When I talked to her, she rejoiced like a small animal.
Even though I'd been hardhearted to her.
Like a small rabbit.
......she really could have been a lion or a wolf.

[Taichi]
"I'm surprised."

My vision became blurred.

[Taichi]
"......nn?"

When I tried touching the corner of my eye,
Tears,
In large quantities.
It's not sadness.
My facial muscles had just tightened up, squeezing out tears.
Without stopping.

[Taichi]
"Uwa, amazing......they're pouring out."

It's mysterious.
My physical body might be grieving.
My heart......
Aaah.
Half of me had died.

[Kiri]
"......Sempai......you......"

Kiri!!

[Miki]
"......"

Miki too.
I quickly......no, there was no point to hiding the knife now.
They'd already seen it.
And......probably misunderstood.

[Kiri]
"You were......a murderer......after all......"

After all.

[Kiri]
"Did you kill her?"

[Taichi]
"......I didn't."

[Kiri]
"But, aren't you holding a knife......?"

[Taichi]
"I was just holding it because I was entering the undergrowth."
[Taichi]
"Come on, look at her wound. It's from an arrow."

[Kiri]
"......I'm not coming......over there."

They're surrounding me at a distance.
Kiri had been gazing at me.
It seems she doesn't want to let her guard down.

[Kiri]
"......even though, not long ago......you were laughing and talking with us......you can do such things so coldly......"

She spat out.

[Kiri]
"Why is that!?"

[Miki]
"............Sempai."

Miki's also receiving a shock.
The face of one who's taking something regretful to heart.

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki."

[Miki]
"Ah, yes......"

They both pulled back.
Leaving me behind.

[Taichi]
"But I didn't do it."

I don't even care anymore.
Youko-chan died.
Unexpectedly, it seems that I've received an impact.
My thoughts were vague, and wouldn't regain their clarity.
That was my lamentation for her.
