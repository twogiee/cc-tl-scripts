Club activities.
Miki leaped out from the shadows.
My eyes didn't miss her.
I squeezed the trigger on my Uzi submachine gun.
Bullets were fired.
Their trajectories swerved downward to hit Miki's feet.

[Miki]
"......ku!?"

Miki noticed.
She jumped behind a planter and returned fire.
Crap, she's got me pinned down!
Mimi-sempai showed herself on my flank.
She took out an empty magazine from her AK-47.

[Misato]
"Sakura-san isn't hereee!"

[Taichi]
"You lost sight of her!?"

[Misato]
"She's really agile......"

[Taichi]
"Ku!......This is bad."

It's bad to lose sight of your enemy.
Then, Kiri came around a corner to our right.
This is bad, they're forming a pincer.
Kiri's M4-A1 Carbine spat fire.

[Misato]
"Ah! They've got us!"

[Taichi]
"Shit!"

Two against one.
I retreated while returning fire.
I'm finished if they surround me.
I'm also worried about Miki.
Right then, a muzzle was pushed into my back.

[Miki]
"Hold up."

W-when did she-!?

[Miki]
"Game set."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, I've been beaten again!"

[Miki]
"Yahooi!"

[Kiri]
"We win!"

Miki and Kiri high-fived.

[Taichi]
"That's four wins in a row......damn!"

The club was going well.
............huh?
