[Sakuraba]
"Yo."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed him a surgical mask.

[Sakuraba]
"Okay."

He put it on without any questions.

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"You're not eating?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm preparing for first period class."

[Taichi]
"......is eating curry bread your class?"

[Sakuraba]
"Until the day curry bread is no more."

He decided coolly.
Just like the records said.

[Taichi]
"Can't you just eat instant curry?"

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."

Just like the records said.
I'm accomplishing a lot.

[Sakuraba]
*hekkusu!!*

[Taichi]
"......a hexagonal tragedy."

This was also in the records.
From what I've confirmed so far, its occurrence rate was above fifteen percent.
Which calculates to being hit with a snot bridge one out of every seven times.
But a great person in the past (me) devised a means of evasion through equipping him with a mask.

[Sakuraba]
"......can I take the mask off?"

[Taichi]
"I cannot allow that."

[Sakuraba]
"Life......is a harsh thing."

[Taichi]
"That's what I want to say."
