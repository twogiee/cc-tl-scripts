I'll eat in Kiri's seat.
Today it's rice balls.
There were seasonings on them, so they appeared quite delicious.

[Taichi]
"Time to eat."

*munch* *munch*

[Kiri]
"......why are you in my seat......?"

[Taichi]
"Welcome back."

[Kiri]
"Ummm......that's......my seat......"

[Taichi]
"That's true. Wanna sit here?"

[Kiri]
"............but, my seat......"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, I see. Sorry."

I borrowed another chair and sat down again.
On the opposite side of her desk.

[Kiri]
"......umm..."

[Taichi]
"Eat. This is a double portion."

[Kiri]
"......Miki's procuring food for me......"

[Taichi]
"Would she mind if you helped yourself to this?"

[Kiri]
"......haa."

She extended her hand.
A successful breakthrough.
Well, Kiri has been losing her nerve lately.

[Taichi]
"Don't touch anything that could serve as a blade or any other weapon."

[Kiri]
"......okay."
[Kiri]
"I don't want to die, after all."

[Taichi]
"Yep, yep. Youko-chan is strong. And she does what she says."

[Kiri]
"......why is she so good with a sling?"
[Kiri]
"It's just strange..."

[Taichi]
"For the most part, she's good at everything."
[Taichi]
"What she can do is fundamentally different."

Whatever she does, she gets the hang of it in an instant.

[Kiri]
"Does she receive special training?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, she used to. She had some kind of long vacation where she went to some foreign country and hired a military instructor on the spot."

[Kiri]
"Military......!?"

She was lost for words.

[Taichi]
"Maybe she learned the sling then. She might have even learned it from a real shepherd."
[Taichi]
"Does it still hurt?"

[Kiri]
"......a little."

[Taichi]
"She's piled up a lot."
[Taichi]
"I'm sure she's done many, many other things too."
[Taichi]
"It feels like she uses most of her life as self-training."
[Taichi]
"I talk like I'm a martial artist too, but I'm no match for her."

[Kiri]
"You were doing martial arts?"

It was good of her to ask.

[Taichi]
"It's called karade."

[Kiri]
"......I don't know that."

[Taichi]
"Eh!?"

[Kiri]
"Is that a spinoff of karate?"

[Taichi]
"No it isn't, you brat!"

[Kiri]
"Kya!"

[Taichi]
"......ah, sorry......I shouldn't have gotten mad......"

Kiri had run three meters away and taken up a battle stance.

[Taichi]
"Come back over here, I'm not going to eat you."

She came back doubtfully.

[Taichi]
"Now, now, eat, eat. I'm actually kind and gentle."

Being told karade is a spinoff of karate made me lose it.

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"She doesn't say it, but she can probably use firearms too."
[Taichi]
"As for martial arts, if you got into a grapple, I think you'd be killed in an instant. She knows a lot of moves, and she bought a really expensive knife recently."

[Kiri]
"......that's......to think of killing someone......for any reason......"

[Taichi]
"Weren't you trying to kill me?"

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Weeell, it doesn't bother me."

[Kiri]
"Sempai......are you okay with this?"
[Kiri]
"I find you......simply detestable."
[Kiri]
"But you saved my life, and now that I can't do anything, I can't help being in this situation."
[Kiri]
"But......that doesn't change the fact that I hate you."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Kiri]
"Please don't misunderstand that."

[Taichi]
"I won't. I think that's just fine."

[Kiri]
"......but, eating together......and getting familiar with one another..."

[Taichi]
"I just want to watch from nearby."

[Kiri]
"......what from nearby?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin."

I smiled.

[Kiri]
"Yo-you're making fun of me!"

She blushed a little.

[Taichi]
"A precious gem is not something to be touched and loved."
[Taichi]
"It is something to be watched and enjoyed."

[Kiri]
"......I can certainly understand why Sempai would think that."
[Kiri]
"But it doesn't sit well with me. If you want to play with a girl that badly, why not do it with Hasekura-sempai?"
[Kiri]
"The rest of us are not tools for your amusement."

[Taichi]
"No good. She only has herself."

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"She's running away. She always has been."
[Taichi]
"It really irritates me."

Kiri threw a look at me like she'd seen something unexpected.

[Kiri]
"......I can't understand any of Sempai's relationships."

[Taichi]
"Well, don't let it bother you so much."

The history between me and Youko-chan...not one of those memories of ours can be called fun.

[Taichi]
"As a tool of amusement, she's useless."
[Taichi]
"......she's got her hands full with this."

[Kiri]
"Which means?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm......"

I thought.
But no adequate exposition was constructed.
There's no need to explain this to Kiri-chin since she sees right through me to start with.

[Taichi]
"Yeah. It'd also be best to stay near me if you can."

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"I think it'll be fine since I said it pretty strongly, but there's a possibility she'll do something to Kiri-chin when my eyes are elsewhere."
[Taichi]
"She might try to chop off your head without me finding out."

Kiri held her neck.

[Kiri]
"......ch-chop off my......"

She was shaking.

[Taichi]
"To preserve your own life, you have to stay near me......let's just leave it at that."

[Kiri]
"......of course, that's true, but......"

[Taichi]
"It's not a reconciliation so much as a truce, right?"

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"And so, let's keep up the friendly fighting."

I held out my left hand.

[Kiri]
"......ha."

Reluctantly, Kiri held out her left hand......but didn't shake mine.
She got angry and pulled it back.

[Kiri]
"............you're mocking me!"

[Taichi]
"Please stop getting mad at every single joke."

I held out my right hand and gripped Kiri's right hand.
A small, slender hand.
It's definitely not suited for weapons.
After crossing the dangerous bridge called Youko-chan, it feels as if our relationship has improved a little.

[Taichi]
"Then let's have a party celebrating the successful truce mediation."

[Miki]
"Procurement completed!"
[Miki]
"......huuuh?"

[Taichi]
"Good work."

[Miki]
"Why are you together?"

[Taichi]
"I invited her."

[Miki]
"......what a scary person......even your enemies are your friends......"

[Taichi]
"This is her thanks for three visits."

[Kiri]
"......that's not true......"
(TL Note: A Chinese and Japanese idiom referring to various stories in which a well-to-do person pays three visits to the home of a less fortunate person, often one of their subordinates.)

[Miki]
"Aaah, you're eating something, what am I going to do with all this food?"

Miki poured out the contents of her tote bag on the desk.
It formed a mountain, spilling off the edges of the desk.

[Taichi]
"Oooooo!"
[Taichi]
"Aren't these all sweets!?"

[Miki]
"Tehe!"

[Kiri]
"......what about canned food?"

[Miki]
"It's all gone."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm. Having sweets for lunch......that seems harsh."

[Miki]
"Is that so?"

[Taichi]
"It's bad for your health."

[Miki]
"But Miki loves sweets."

[Kiri]
"I'm already full myself, so..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, so am I."

[Miki]
"......eeeh?"
[Miki]
"Then I'll eat these myself."

She took offense.

[Kiri]
"......you'll get fat."

[Miki]
"......"
[Miki]
"Even if I'm fat, I'll still love sweets."

She started eating some potato chips.

[Taichi]
"Doesn't it bother you on the inside?"

[Miki]
"But, buuut!"

[Kiri]
"Don't cry......"

[Taichi]
"Come on, I'll give you this rice ball."

Its size is intended for an adult male, so for Kiri-chin it should be just about right.
It wasn't really enough for me, but......whatever.

[Miki]
"Aaaaah, handmade fooooood."

She clung to the sleeve of the hand holding the rice ball.

[Taichi]
"Do you want it? Mmm?"

I held it up high.

[Miki]
"Ah! I want it..."

[Taichi]
"Here now, here now."

To the right.

[Miki]
"Aaauuu..."

[Taichi]
"Uriuri."

To the left.

[Miki]
"Uuuaaa..."

[Kiri]
"......you're harassing her."

[Taichi]
"......here now."

[Miki]
"Aaah, delishus!"

She started biting into it.
Leaving the mountain of sweets.

[Taichi]
"......those are......unsettling eating habits......for a girl. Is it always like this?"

[Kiri]
"It's normally canned food or bread."

[Taichi]
"Eat vegetables."

[Kiri]
"There aren't any."

[Taichi]
"Here, tomatoes. I've got two of them."

[Miki]
"Aaaaah, tomatoeees..."

[Taichi]
"Mmm? Do you want one?"

[Miki]
"I want one!"

[Taichi]
"Here now, here now."

To the right.

[Miki]
"Aaauuu..."

[Taichi]
"Uriuri."

To the left.

[Miki]
"Uuuaaa..."

[Kiri]
"............as I thought, this person......is just a bully."

[Taichi]
*sigh*

[Kiri]
"Nnnnnnn."

[Miki]
"Souuur."

[Kiri]
"But delicious......"

[Miki]
"I'm gonna cry."

[Kiri]
"It's nice to be alive."

[Miki]
"Nyauuu."

What eating habits do these two have?
While watching Miki's and Kiri's mouths turn into a 『＊』 shape as they ate the tomatoes, I quenched my throat with a water bottle.

[Taichi]
*cough* *cough!*

She's watching, she's watching!!!
I'm being stared at!!
She's a lump of jealousy......
Showing herself to me as if I'm doing something to bother her......must be an intentional hint.
As a kunoichi, she's supposed to have a high degree of secrecy.
She's not something I'd be able to find.

[Miki]
"What's happened?"

[Taichi]
"......we're being watched with Ichihara-style intelligence gathering."

[Miki]
"Ichihara?"

[Taichi]
"Espionage techniques passed down through an incredibly skilled group led by E. Ichihara."

[Miki]
"?"
(TL Note: This might be a reference to Ichihara Etsuko, who plays the lead role in the Asian drama "Kaseifu wa Mita" or "I Saw a Maid.")

[Kiri]
"Kyaaaaa!!?"

Apparently Kiri saw her too.

[Kiri]
"Sempai! Se! Sempa......ah, that, that......"

[Taichi]
"It's okay, I'm right next to you."

[Kiri]
"......o-okay......"

[Miki]
"Eh? Eh?"

[Kiri]
"Wh-what......?"

Kiri pointed. Miki said, "Wha-?" and looked.
Youko-chan was gone.

[Miki]
"......eh? There's nothing there...what happened?"

[Kiri]
"J-just now I'm sure I......Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"The Shimura Phenomenon. Miki can no longer physically observe Youko-chan."

*Shimura Phenomenon = Taichi physics. A kind of observational problem found within stable, specific situations. That which someone can and cannot see is fixed as a personal attribute. Those attributes are often destroyed due to a major change within the situation.
Aaaaah, she's watching......

[Kiri]
"......ku!"

Kiri was stressed half to death.
I held her shoulders reflexively.
The corners of Youko-chan's eyes shook.
This is something hopelessly rare.

[Kiri]
"......uu, uuuuu......"

Kiri was getting nervous and not noticing how familiar I was acting around her.
Like a cat driven into a corner.

[Taichi]
"......your shoulders feel delicate."

I find her adorable, but at the same time I had the desire to destroy her.
Those two feelings existed simultaneously.
......I let go of her.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, be careful."

[Kiri]
"......meaning?"

[Taichi]
"Even if you don't get injured, there's a possibility she'll do disagreeable things to you."

[Kiri]
"Di-disagreeable? Concretely speaking, what do you mean?"

[Taichi]
"Uhhhh......I think it'd be quite insidious."
[Taichi]
"Stealing your dignity...humiliating you as much as possible while still passing it off as a joke."

[Kiri]
"......isn't that the same as you?"

[Taichi]
"Uu!"

[Kiri]
"......I knew it......I can't trust you."

Kiri returned to Miki's side.
Aaaaah, my lover's been stolen by homosexuality.

[Taichi]
"Damn you!"

I'll try hating Miki.

[Miki]
"......yeees?"
