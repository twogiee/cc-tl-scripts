[Kiri]
"Wha---!!?"

Kiri shuddered.

[Kiri]
"What is that underwear......"

I was still wearing the elephant underwear Miki had equipped me with (gives a more exact impression than 'put on me') yesterday.

[Miki]
"Huh? Doesn't Sempai take baths?"

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Miki]
"He doesn't!"

[Kiri]
"Unclean......"

Ku! Damn little hygienic girls.
They gather and reproach people.

[Miki]
"Isn't it summer?"

[Kiri]
"......his character's like that, so his personal grooming is also..."

[Taichi]
"Are you treating a filthy person like a sinner?"

[Kiri]
"It might be best to bring an end to this here and now......"

[Taichi]
"Wait up!"

[Miki]
"Hmm. Sempai's root has lowered greatly."
//"Root?"-Spin

[Taichi]
"It's only been one day. It enters once every two days."

[Kiri]
"I'm not understanding anything......"

[Miki]
"Not entering daily is subpar."

[Taichi]
"Eh!? Is that so? Youko-chan never said that......she never told me......"

There are many cases like this when someone will mature with their originality intact unless they exchange information with human friends of the same generation!
//Oh so that's why I'm like this. 〜IX
Being a normal person is a very difficult thing!

[Miki]
"What do we do, Kiri-chin?"

[Kiri]
"This is bad, Miki."

[Miki]
"Yeah, it's bad."

They informed each other.
//Japanese line! - Sheeta
//That was truly pathetic. 〜IX

[Kiri]
"I thought he was weird, but to think he was this bad......"

[Miki]
"We have no choice but to do it."

[Kiri]
"Yes. There's nothing else to be done."

[Miki]
"After all, you have to participate in the club with this guy."

[Kiri]
"Mm. Do it where?"

[Taichi]
"What do you mean by 『do』?"

They ignored me and continued speaking to one another.
Low voices. I can hear fragments.

[Miki]
"A place where people won't see it."

[Kiri]
"Silently,"

[Miki]
"With strong drugs,"

[Kiri]
"If we dare to,"

What are these girls talking about?

[Taichi]
"......this atmosphere seems bad......"

Perhaps I should run away.

[Kiri]
"Don't move!"

[Taichi]
"Hii!?"

No good. I can't run away.
It'd be bad to stimulate Kiri any further.

[Miki]
"Sempai, we've decided on your sentence."

[Taichi]
"......would it be okay if I put my pants back on?"

[Miki]
"No it wouldn't."

[Taichi]
"Are you a demon?"

[Miki]
"You will accompany us."

Miki said 'us.'

[Taichi]
"I understand......but to receive such treatment just for not taking a bath for one day......"
(TL Note: The particular pronoun Miki used is almost exclusive to royalty.)

[Miki]
"Don't even try. Sempai has no merits at all in the first place, so cleanliness is practically a duty for you."
[Miki]
"But Sempai got lazy."

[Kiri]
"You are abnormal......in many ways."

I'm being treated like an abnormal.

[Miki]
"Let's go."

I was brought along.
And,

[Taichi]
"......eh? What's being done to me?"

I'm incredibly uneasy.
Sempai still hasn't come.
There's no one here to save me.
Miki brought a hose out of a prefab structure.
Kiri maintained surveillance on me with her crossbow.

[Miki]
"Sempai, strip."

[Taichi]
"More than this?"

[Kiri]
"......"

I'll be sniped by the crossbow.

[Taichi]
"......yesh."

I stripped.
I took off my shirt.
I am now nothing more than elephant underwear.

[Taichi]
"......these too?"

[Miki]
"Hmmm, well, I'll let that go."

And then Miki released the valve on her hose.

[Miki]
"There!"

An intense flow of water attacked me.

[Taichi]
"Upu!"

[Miki]
"Take that!"

Is that what this is?
Compulsory cleaning?
Aaah, if only it was a compulsory sexual massage...

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, the drug!"

[Kiri]
"Okay."

Kiri shot something.

[Taichi]
"Uu! Th-this is...?"

A displeasing citrus mist.
Body soap?
She gripped the bottle as they washed me.

[Miki]
"And now, and now,"

Both of them came toward me with deck brushes......deck brushes!!?

[Miki]
"Goooo!!"

[Kiri]
"Ei! Ei!"

I was washed like the deck of a ship.

[Taichi]
"Owowowowowowowow!!?"

It's prickly! It prickles!

[Taichi]
"I'm not a deck!"

Dammit, is this because I ate canned bread this morning!?
Is the world a gag?
(TL Note: "Canned bread" and "ship's deck" happen to be homonyms.)

[Miki]
"Soap, soap, soap!"

[Kiri]
"Soap, ei!!"

Repeated calls for soap.
I'm a little excited.
I will...make you both...with soap...into soap...into women......
//Is it worth mentioning that he swapped one letter of "soopu" with a kanji meaning "woman"? It doesn't look to me like that'd really add to this line. 〜IX
Deck brushes once again.
I got used to the sharp pain, and stopped caring.
In fact, the prickly sensation became refreshing.

[Kiri]
"Mi-Miki! Th-the elephant is!!?"

[Miki]
"U-uwaaaaaa!!? The elephant trumpeteeed!!"

A discharge of water.

[Kiri]
"Pervert! Pervert!!"

[Taichi]
"Th-this is just because I received a stimulus......I can't help it......upu!"

[Miki]
"Scrub, scrub, scrub, scruuub!!"

She rubbed frantically.

[Kiri]
"Kya! The elephant's gone!"

It was taken off in the stream of water.

[Miki]
"The elephant cover I bought at Atomic Goods!!?"

So you did get it at Atomic Goods......
The owner (Female - Beautiful - Twenty-five) is a pervert herself so she sells indiscriminately.

[Miki]
"Look, Kiri-chin, it's like an entirely different creature!"

[Kiri]
"I mustn't look! My eyes will rot!"

Are you elementary schoolgirls?

[Miki]
"Ginyaaa, it just shook!?"

[Kiri]
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

They ran away.
I was left behind......naked......

[Taichi]
"......hu."

Tears in the corners of my eyes.

[Misato]
"Fuaaa, now for another day of hard work......nn?"
[Misato]
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!?"

Judging by that reaction, she's a virgin.

[Taichi]
"Hu."

Suffer......

[Taichi]
"Uu! Uu! Uu!"

I decided to cry.
*whoosh!*
A bath towel was placed on me.

[Miki]
"......weeell, sorry about running away."
[Miki]
"That was too strong a stimulus for a maiden. Here you go."

New underwear and my uniform.

[Taichi]
"Uu! Miki......such a good girl."

I put them on.

[Miki]
"Now that you're clean, that looks great."

[Taichi]
"My whole body stings though."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chiii, Mimi-sempai, I'm doneee."

[Kiri]
"......reallyyy?"

They both came out terrified.

[Miki]
"So, let's start the club."

She smiled brightly.
And then we devoted ourselves to club activities.
Aaah, it was this easy.
Unity.
What was that campout I labored to carry out?
Was that a bad way to do it? Or was I too forceful?
How should I touch people?
I don't understand any of it.
