[Misato]
"Ha, haeee..."

Sempai arrived.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Sempai."

A hello from atop the stepladder.

[Kiri]
"......morning."

[Misato]
"Fuwaaa..."

[Taichi]
"Rapid fire moe words."
[Taichi]
"But those two are rather old."
[Taichi]
"For a moe girl living in the 22nd century, there's not much left besides 'yuaaan' and 'yuyooon'---"

[Misato]
"Are you the poet Nakahara Chuuya? Is your mouth agape?"

She retorted with a clear-cut face.

[Taichi]
"......geh, you know him."

[Misato]
"I like Nakahara."

[Taichi]
"We-well, if you talk about learning from the past or the Restoration movement......it's like asking the old to learn the new!"

[Misato]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway......congratulations on being discharged from the hospital."

[Misato]
"Aaah, my wounds weren't that serious."

[Taichi]
"Do they still hurt?"

[Misato]
"......I'm fine, but..."

I was being stared at.
I also stared at Sempai's beautiful breasts.

[Misato]
"Uh, ummm, why are you working on the antenna?"

She asked me while hiding her bust with both arms.

[Taichi]
"......on a whim."

[Misato]
"A whim......"

[Taichi]
"It was a whim."

[Misato]
"......!"

An unsatisfied face.

[Taichi]
"I, who am both sound and healthy, want to live optimistically."
[Taichi]
"And then, someday, I shall metamorphose into a young adult who has tasted both the sweets and sours of life."

[Misato]
"Into...a pervert!!?"

She further embraced her bust.
(TL Note: "Metamorphose" and "pervert" happen to be written with the same kanji.)
Sempai is nice...
She'll even fondle her own breasts...

[Taichi]
"That's incorrect!"

Kiri exhaled on the opposite side of the antenna.

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's right. There are a lot of things I want to ask you about."

I took out a sketch.

[Taichi]
"I don't quite understand the note here."

[Kiri]
"When you're done, I also have something to ask you, Club President-sempai."

[Misato]
"Ha, haa."

[Taichi]
"And what'll we do about the batteries?"

[Misato]
"Eh? I was thinking we'd......get them from cars parked at the school."

[Taichi]
"Now that's a man's job. I'll make Sakuraba do it."

[Misato]
"Eh? But we shouldn't assume Sakuraba-kun's going to help......"

[Taichi]
"If I say 'help out' he'll help out. Probably."
[Taichi]
"Since all he wants is to live an easy life."

[Misato]
"No, that's not what I......"

I know Sempai's true intention.
This club was a flight for her and her alone.
Even if we all do this together, Sempai's thirst won't be quenched.
If it took forever, that'd be fine by her.
Since she could inexhaustibly devote herself to it.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Sempai, is this really going to end when we complete the antenna and send the SOS?"

[Misato]
"Yes, basically......"

It will end, along with her flight.
That's why this person has been working by herself.
So that it won't end.

[Taichi]
"There might not be a response to the SOS right away."

[Misato]
"Haa......"

[Taichi]
"And there's the problem of directionality......"
[Taichi]
"They could be using handheld wireless devices rather than FM radios, right?"

[Misato]
"Yes......"

[Taichi]
"So we have to think about reception."

[Misato]
"Aaah, that's true......"

[Taichi]
"It'll be like a broadcast channel."
[Taichi]
"Once we open the channel, we'll have to keep maintaining it until there's a reaction."

[Misato]
"............ah."

[Taichi]
"It'll get busy."

[Misato]
"............"

Redness pierced Sempai's face.

[Misato]
"You're right, it will."
[Misato]
"Yeah, that might......"
[Misato]
"It's a good thing to be busy, isn't it?"

[Taichi]
"Very much so."
[Taichi]
"Besides, it's more fun if everyone does it."
[Taichi]
"If all three of us work on it, do you think it'll end in a day?"

[Kiri]
"......it's a bit tough for me. I don't understand this at all."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, if only we had a mechanically knowledgeable pretty girl..."

[Misato]
"Why are you specifying the gender......?"

Then, with great timing a presence pattered up to us.

[Miki]
"Kiri-chiiin, are you heeere?"

The door opened, and there was Miki.

[Taichi]
"Bingoooo!"

[Misato]
"Eh?......what is it?"

I told her what was going on.

[Miki]
"Fuiii, such a healthy thing..."

[Taichi]
"Your high-tech knowledge is needed."

[Miki]
"PCs, sure, but I don't know much about wireless."

[Taichi]
"Aren't your grades good?"

[Miki]
"That doesn't help with special technical skills."

[Taichi]
"But you can understand difficult books."

[Miki]
"Well, well well well......"
[Miki]
"Even so, I would like to see more people......"

She glanced at her partner.

[Miki]
"And Kiri-chin's here..."

[Kiri]
"......sorry."

[Miki]
"You don't have to apologize......I'm just surprised."
[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, what will we do about 'that?'"

[Kiri]
"......sorry."

[Miki]
"Canceled?"

[Kiri]
"......yeah. Well......a lot of things have happened."

[Taichi]
"'That'?"

'That.' The 'that' of tender girls.
The secret 'that.'

[Miki]
"Things happened?"

[Kiri]
"Sorry, talking about that here would be..."

She doesn't want it overheard.

[Miki]
"Hmmm. Then......"
[Miki]
"Nyaaa?"

She meowed.

[Kiri]
"......nyaaa."

[Miki]
"Nyan-nyaka-nyaka-nyaka."

[Kiri]
"......naaago."

[Misato]
"Are they...speaking cat?"

[Taichi]
"It would appear so......"

We were afraid.
While the two of us shivered in the corner, Miki and Kiri went on 'nyaaa'ing.
Without pause.

[Miki]
"I see......so that's what happened..."

She'd come to terms with it.

[Taichi]
"Did that actually convey any information?"

Are youngsters these days creating their own languages as well!?

[Miki]
"Well then, well then, it seems that we no longer have an army or a country to found."

[Kiri]
"......yes. I think that's impossible at this point."

[Miki]
"Weren't we carrying weapons for self-defense, not for an army?"

That's just like a certain country......

[Taichi]
"From what I could perceive, that conversation seems to have a connection with me."
[Taichi]
"Weren't you carrying a knife too, Miki? I think it'd be best if you got rid of that."

[Miki]
"But it's pretty convenient to have one."

[Kiri]
"You were carrying a knife?"

[Miki]
"Nyaaa."

[Kiri]
"Ah, sorry."

[Taichi]
"That is incredibly convenient."

What kind of grammar does it have?

[Miki]
"It plays an active part in all sorts of facets of daily life."

[Taichi]
"......hmmm, well it should be fine as long as you don't give it to Kiri-chin, okay?"

[Miki]
"Okay. Then I'll be sure not to."
[Miki]
"Stiiill, to think Kiri-chin and Sempai have reconciled......the world is coming to an end."

[Kiri]
"We haven't reconci-"

[Taichi]
"......seems so."

[Miki]
"Hmmm."
[Miki]
"Sempai, come here a moment."

My hand was pulled, and I stepped away from the antenna.
To a location where our conversation wouldn't reach Kiri and Sempai.

[Taichi]
"......and?"

[Miki]
"I've heard the general circumstances, but..."

That catspeak is amazing.

[Miki]
"Sempai, are you okay with that?"

[Taichi]
"Okay with what?"

I don't really understand Miki's question.

[Miki]
"It's true that Kiri-chin is like that around Sempai......she seems to have trouble dealing with you......"

[Taichi]
"She hated me. Just say it."

[Miki]
"Ahaha......well..."

A forced smile.

[Miki]
"Actually, she's been asking me to come and live away from everyone, just the two of us."

[Taichi]
"Eh? Why?"

[Miki]
"Kiricchi can't trust people. So, in this disordered situation...she says it's dangerous to be near people like Sempai."

Wooow, Kiri-chin is perceptive.

[Miki]
"So......weeell......about you, Sempai."

[Taichi]
"I was the hypothetical enemy?"

[Miki]
"......yes."

She lowered her shoulders.

[Miki]
"As for why......Kiri-chin won't tell me. She's always been that way."

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Miki]
"Though lately she's started to seem a bit neurotic."
[Miki]
"......given all that, do you think things can go well with Kiri-chin?"

Miki asked me doubtfully.

[Taichi]
"Hmm, I had Youko-chan back out by promising to make things go well with Kiri-chin."

[Miki]
"Hasekura-sempai......did she hurt Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"She'll just appear out of nowhere."

[Miki]
"Just like a hero."

[Taichi]
"That's right. My heroine."

[Miki]
"You're making a girl's face."

[Taichi]
"......I haven't once met a good fate with her."
[Taichi]
"She just frightens me, throws me down and confuses me."

[Miki]
"......is that how it is..."

[Taichi]
"At one point, I stopped wanting to meet people. I didn't want to converse with other people."

[Miki]
"Now you're the exact opposite."

[Taichi]
"Because it's food."

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"......because it's something I need."
[Taichi]
"The fact of the matter is, even if I hate food, I'll die if I don't eat."
[Taichi]
"There's a lot inside my heart, and the way to eat got swept up in it."
[Taichi]
"I used to think that people thought badly of me because of my face. My eyes in particular kept bugging me."

[Miki]
"Eyes?"

[Taichi]
"I get the feeling that my eyes are different from others'......well, I also get the feeling that my face was built differently......"

[Miki]
"It's a little pretty. Couldn't you call it handsome?"

[Taichi]
"Everyone tells me that."

[Miki]
"Hahaa, so that's Sempai's emotional wound."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, this is something like an extra on top of extras, to be honest......"

'Hey now, hey now,' I remonstrated myself.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, the deal is, in order for Youko-chan to stay away, Kiri has to stay powerless."

[Miki]
"The conversation flew away."

[Taichi]
"Which is why I'll be borrowing Kiri-chin."

[Miki]
"Ummm......please don't harass her, okay? I know it's fun to, but..."

[Taichi]
"......I'll take the proper measures."

[Miki]
"In that case, I'll join you two."

Like this,
Miki was added to our group.
