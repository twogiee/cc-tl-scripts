[Taichi]
"Haa."

I began walking to school like a robot.
An incongruity in my crotch.
Chafing hurts.
I'll become bowlegged.

[Taichi]
"If only I had the charm that makes bowlegs look good......should I go with bankara?"

All I can do now is stomp my feet and keep the team banner from falling to the ground.
(TL Note: "Bankara (Barbaric Color)" is a look analogous to the Western "gangsta". It was created to contrast with "Haikara".)
As I walked up the hill,
(TL Note: The "Haikara (High color)" look is meant to imitate upbeat Westerners.))

[Taichi]
"Mu!?"

The sound of a tire scraping against the ground.
A sign of danger.

[Taichi]
"......hu, too easy!"

This body was baptized with fellatio this morning.
My whole body has become sensitive from having just cummed!
That is to say, my ability to sense danger has become sharper.

[Taichi]
"Haa!!"

No matter what sort of attack occurs, if one can predict it in advance, it's easy to evade.
*impact!*

[Taichi]
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeh!!!"

If only the chastity belt wasn't interfering with my walking!!

[Nanaka]
"Soooorry!!"

I was thrown into the grove of trees while she appealed to me with a side view of her chest.

[Nanaka]
"You okaaay?"

[Taichi]
"......the chastity belt protected me."

[Nanaka]
"Haa?"

[Taichi]
"Sarcasm regarding something in my head. Don't worry about it."

I came out of the trees and wiped off the dirt.
Walking bowlegged, of course.

[Nanaka]
"Bowleggeeeed."

[Taichi]
"......don't call it that."

Damn this girl whose mouth runs off so reflexively.

[Nanaka]
"You seem energetic this week too."

[Taichi]
"What you speak fails to convey meaning."
[Taichi]
"But I shall make you convey it, Tomie!"

[Nanaka]
"It's Nanaka, Taichi."
(TL Note: "Tomie" is a manga about an immortal girl whose supernatural powers can, and inevitably do, cause anyone around her to fall in love with her and commit violence as a result.)

[Taichi]
"Anyway, why does a person that's perfectly unknown to me know my name?"

[Nanaka]
"Don't worry about it."

[Taichi]
"I will worry."

She seemed to have good motor skills.
Even though I'm walking at slow speed, she's matching my pace without faltering.
She came across as a lively, energetic, childhood-friend- type pretty girl.
Who'd come and wake me up every morning.

[Taichi]
"So, what's your business here, as a person who feels nonexistent?"

[Nanaka]
"Feels nonexistent?"

[Taichi]
"None. Faint. Sketchy."

[Nanaka]
"I don't really understand, but is it related to my presence?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. The presence I feel from you makes it clear to my cranial deliberation committee that you are not human."

[Nanaka]
"Ha, you figured out that much......you're too sharp, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hu!"

Here was an effect of the morning fellatio that I couldn't have thought of.

[Taichi]
"By combining these sensation abilities with my meta-reasoning, I can even extract your true identity."

[Nanaka]
"Uwa, really?"

[Taichi]
"You are a girl of Scorpius......in other words, I think that you are a sentient life form living on Star V861 in the Scorpius constellation."

[Nanaka]
"Isn't that place a black hole?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Nanaka]
"So you just say whatever feels right."

[Taichi]
"......well, that's my job."

[Nanaka]
"Must be tough every time."

[Taichi]
"I don't understand 'every time' or 'this week.' Isn't this our first meeting?"

[Nanaka]
"I've crashed into you several times."

[Taichi]
"No, you haven't."

It's not in my memory.
And I have no memory loss.

[Nanaka]
"......well, that's fine and all,"
[Nanaka]
"Still, it'd be interesting if love sprouted at least once..."

She said something amazing.

[Taichi]
"Eh?......Are you saying you have a thing for me? Me with the hook nose?"

[Nanaka]
"What hook nose? It looks normal to me."

[Taichi]
"It's crooked. Can't you see that?"

[Nanaka]
"Not aaat all."

[Taichi]
"That's strange......"

[Nanaka]
"It might be a little crooked......but I don't think it's enough to worry about."

Frankly.

[Taichi]
"So it was true......it was crooked......"

The way my nose bends has bugged me for a long time.
......I became self-conscious with maturity around the same time that I began to hate myself.

[Taichi]
"Uuuuuuuuun."

[Nanaka]
"What is it? What is it?"

I wonder if that's true.
Various malices and ill wills from my surroundings...
Did I become conscious of such things, and desire to rationalize them with my looks?
I've read such theories before.

[Taichi]
"Well, looks don't matter. It doesn't change the inclination to make main characters of stories look pretty in the pictures even if they're described as mediocre in the text."

[Nanaka]
"......well, well, that's enough poison for the soul."

Nanaka made the face of a secretary who'd handed down a political decision.

[Taichi]
"So, just how are you related to this Humanity Annihilation Syndrome?"

[Nanaka]
"Unrelated."

[Taichi]
"That has to be a lie......absolutely."

[Nanaka]
"It's true. Humanity got annihilated on its own. I don't know the reason."

I quietly gazed at the girl.

[Taichi]
"......you know?"

[Nanaka]
"I saw."

[Taichi]
"You saw!?"

[Nanaka]
"Yeah. I saw."
[Nanaka]
"The world was annihilated slowly."

[Taichi]
"Slowly?"
[Taichi]
"How slow is slowly?"

[Nanaka]
"Nnn, I don't know. I lost my sense of time."

[Taichi]
"It's weird. After all, wasn't it normal before we went on the campout?"
[Taichi]
"The campout was three days and two nights...... were they all annihilated in three days?"

[Nanaka]
"Oh no."

Nanaka shook her head.

[Nanaka]
"......more than that."

[Taichi]
"But that's just strange. It doesn't match logic."

[Nanaka]
"I think it's a matter of how you look at things."

[Taichi]
"Haa?"

I didn't know what she meant.

[Nanaka]
"Well, there's no point in thinking about things that have already passed."

[Taichi]
"That's true, but......humanity really disappeared that easily..."

[Nanaka]
"I think something happened somewhere."
[Nanaka]
"I can somehow feel it in my skin."

[Taichi]
"Somewhere?"

[Nanaka]
"I can't explain it well with words......"
[Nanaka]
"I think a big wave came from somewhere, and that spread out rapidly."
[Nanaka]
"That's the limit of my perception."

[Taichi]
"......are you......a god?"

She made a wry smile.

[Nanaka]
"No, no. I'm nothing special. I can't do a thing."
[Nanaka]
"......I don't know anything."

[Taichi]
"Then why are you here in front of me?"

[Nanaka]
"......nn, that's......I can't quite say it. I don't have the right to say it. I'm sorry."

[Taichi]
"The right......hmm..."

I know that sensation well.
Just as......I don't have the right to live and hang out normally with my friends.
That's why I was sent here, to Gunjou.
Because I'm something that can hurt people.
Because I'm dangerous, I don't have the right to make friends.
And that's......correct. Oppressively so.

[Taichi]
"Then I won't pry."

[Nanaka]
"......nn, sorry."

[Taichi]
"Forget it."
[Taichi]
"Still, I don't understand anything."

[Nanaka]
"I think if 'that girl' gives it her all, the mystery will be solved."

[Taichi]
"That girl? Do you mean Youko-chan?"

[Nanaka]
"......although I can't bring myself to like her."

She narrowed her lips.

[Taichi]
"So you hate her."

[Nanaka]
"That's not it, but......somehow she just doesn't sit well with me."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

[Nanaka]
"After making her clean up, I'll point out her deficiency by rubbing the window frame with my finger."

[Taichi]
"You're thinking like a mother-in-law."

[Nanaka]
"A mother-in-law......that's not bad."

[Taichi]
"What does that mean?"

[Nanaka]
"Taichi."

I heard her voice from quite far behind.

[Taichi]
"?"

An impossible distance.
Nanaka had been next to me until three seconds ago.
Twenty meters. Not a distance one could traverse in an instant.

[Taichi]
"......"

[Nanaka]
"Since this seems to be the most effective..."

[Taichi]
"Wait, you......"

I knew it.
She's not human.

[Nanaka]
"......you know about the hokora, right?"

[Taichi]
"The hokora..."

[Youko]
『With that and the information from the hokora, I have a general grasp of the situation.』

It's related.

[Nanaka]
"If you want to know, go there!"

A white fingertip shot out, pointing to me.
No, to something behind me.
The school.
No......the mountains?
There was a mountain path that we used during the campout.
There are a lot of animals on that path, but it reaches the summit quickly.
And at the end of it.
There's a hokora.
I don't know what's enshrined there.
A small, old, decayed hokora.
A place that might be dedicated to an unworshipped god.
No one goes near it any more.
There's something there.
I returned my gaze to Nanaka, in order to ask her a trivial question.
She'd disappeared.
Along with her bike.

[Taichi]
"............"

The cicadas weren't chirping. A quiet new term.
