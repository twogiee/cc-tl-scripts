*whshhhh* (running water)

[Taichi]
*sigh*

[Youko]
"......without even telling me."

[Taichi]
"----!!??"

That scared me half to death.

[Taichi]
"......hey, Youko-chan."

[Youko]
"Are you faking love for her?"

Her tone of voice lacked any intonation.

[Taichi]
"You know, would you mind not sneaking up behind me without any presence?"

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"What'll you do if my heart stops?"

[Youko]
"......Taichi's heart......wouldn't stop so...... easily."

[Taichi]
"How rude!"

[Youko]
"Cohabiting without my knowledge."

[Taichi]
"Why do I need to get Youko-chan's permission?"

The eyes in the mirror moistened delicately.
Truly, delicately.

[Taichi]
"Besides, even you're calling it fake love."
[Taichi]
"If that's what you see it as, then there shouldn't be a problem. There's no reason to look at every little game and sport, is there?"

She faintly hesitated.

[Youko]
"......but, Taichi's done this before......and failed."

[Taichi]
"The situation was different back then."
[Taichi]
"Besides, it's my responsibility to stay with Touko."
[Taichi]
"......just maybe, if our current life calms down, Touko might be able to support herself in the future. If that happens, then I can just cut myself off from her again."

[Youko]
"......that's a small possibility."

[Taichi]
"That's why I said, 'just maybe.'"

[Youko]
"............"

Has she accepted it, or not?
I couldn't try to learn anything from her facial features.
She basically has a flawless poker face on at all times.
Basically...

[Youko]
"If you can't control your sexual desires, then-"

[Taichi]
"About that,"

I cut her off strongly.

[Taichi]
"Give it up. I'm hanging out with Touko now."

[Youko]
"......I see."

She suddenly left.
At the same time she disappeared from view, that sense of an independent existence vanished.
She'd killed her own presence.
That's the sort of thing she can do.

[Taichi]
"Haaaa......"

I was tired.
