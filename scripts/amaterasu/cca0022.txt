"Oooh, I'm inhaling the smell..."

There were very few guards around.
There are usually ten of them standing here, but today there were only two.
We must be having a lot of absences at the moment because everyone's having mental problems due to the heat.
Which was why the cafeteria was so nice and quiet.
Thanks to that I could easily get the highly sought-after menus.
No......if I used a certain connection of mine, I could get them easily anyway.
But that must not be used.
My forbidden secret tactic.
It's a double-edged sword.
Aaah, but Yuusa-chan's really cute.
I bought a ticket for the B meal and waited at the counter.

[Voice]
"Oh, you! What're you doing here!?" (98 Phon)

[Taichi]
"Dowaaaa!!?"
(TL Note: Phons attempt to measure actual perceived loudness by considering sound intensity and frequency, while decibels are based only on intensity.)

It's here!

[Voice]
"Say hello now, huhuhu."

That woman laughed with a muffled voice resembling an abnormally huge leader of a group of bandits one might find drinking sake in the depths of a cave in a fantasy game. (Sometimes he's larger than the cave entrance. What's with that?)
//Fully punctuated sentences inside parentheses + full sentence outside of parentheses = period goes before parenthetical expression. - pondrthis
I was afraid.

[Taichi]
"Don't scare me, oba-chan. I'm a delicate writer."

Oba-chan: "You think you're a writer? Don't talk in your sleep!" (118 Phon)
Her angry voice traversed the cafeteria with a bang.
(TL Note: At the frequency of the average adult female voice, phons are a little higher than decibels.))
The reinforced glass was shaking (not possible).
I watched with absurd interest.

[Taichi]
"......you're loud, oba-chan."

Oba-chan: "I'm just talking normally. The kids here are just weak!" (94 Phon)
Oba-chan: "You take it easy yourself!" (115 Phon)

[Taichi]
"!?"

Sensing danger, I took a step back.
A giant deformed hand passed in front of my eyes with a roar.

[Taichi]
(Just now...) (Skinship?) (If I'd been hit......) (Death!?)

I accidentally used the method of thought depiction from Tsutsui ****taka's Nanase Series.
(TL Note: "Skinship" refers to the concept of deepening an emotional connection to someone through physical contact.)
I can't explain it, but I feel like there's a connection to Nanase (no there isn't).
(TL Note: This novel trilogy is about a psychic girl named Hita Nanase trying to live with her powers, which tend to reveal dark secrets and tragic accidents.)
Oba-chan: "You really are persistent, aren't you!? Huhuhu."
Oba-chan: "You want some food at least, right?"
//sounded just a touch like "you, at least, can defeat me" i.e. you at least as opposed to jimmie-bob. This way it's more like, "you're gonna buy something, right?" - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"Ye...yesh."

I held out my meal ticket, feeling like I was giving candy to a lion.
Oba-chan: "Since you're looking after Yuusa, I'll give you something special."

[Taichi]
"Hahaha, thanks, hahaha."

Yes.
This very person was being allowed to exist as the mother of the ultimate pretty girl Yuusa-chan.
So in a few decades Yuusa's going to---

[Mommy]
"What's wrong? You look faint."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, yeah, I was feeling dizzy."
//It sounded REALLY off since he was just repeating what she said without really confirming it. Not too sure about what I added but that's the best I could think of.-Spin

[Mommy]
"We can't have that now. You need more flesh and blood."

Hahaue-sama made her decision.

[Mommy]
"Here you go, an S meal."
(TL Note: "Hahaue-sama" is a more formal and impersonal version of "okaa-san.")

[Taichi]
"There's an S?"

[Mommy]
"I made it just for you!" (118 Phon)

Spoken in a loud voice echoing throughout the cafeteria.
*whisper* *whisper*......
I'm being whispered about.

[Taichi]
"......I'm very grateful Hahaue-sama, but......"

[Mommy]
"Oh? Hahaue-sama? Now that's nice to hear!"

My food doubled in height.

[Mommy]
"Hey, you, how's it with my daughter?"

[Taichi]
"Ha? How am I supposed to answer that?"

[Mommy]
"Aren't you winning her over!?"

[Taichi]
*cough* *cough!*

[Mommy]
"A son-in-law...that'd be nice. Huhuhu."

[Taichi]
"Son-in-law!?"

And even more food!!?

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry, this is enough, Hahaue-sama!"

[Mommy]
"No problem, don't worry about it!"

She added a second plate of pork cutlet.
This is......a bribe! Is it a buyoff?
*whisper*......

[Taichi]
"Awawawawa."

Rumors are spreading!
Right now everyone's spreading incredible rumors about me!

[Mommy]
"You must have a lot going on, so don't sweat the hard stuff."
[Mommy]
"Leave it all to me."

The miso soup which should have nothing but seaweed in it, for some reason, had whole crabs thrown in.
//while this is cool to know... umm... who hasn't eaten miso soup? Even my mom who hates asian food and all things asian knows what miso soup is. - pondrthis
*whisper* *whisper* *whisper* *whisper*......
(TL Note: "miso" is literally "fermented soybean paste.")

[Voice]
"......accepting a bribe......"
[Voice]
"Golden parachute......"
[Voice]
"......insider trading..."
[Voice]
"Something unlawful......"
[Voice]
"......the person concerned with a question of worship......"

[Taichi]
"Uguu!"

Bad.
This matter is beneath the dignity of Kurosu Taichi.
Now I had four plates of pork cutlet.

[Taichi]
"That's too many!"

[Mommy]
"Nn? What? You're a boy. Can't you eat at least this much!?"

She slammed down on my shoulders with arms like those of a crown-of-thorns starfish devouring Okinawan coral.
The doubling of dead weight pushed me into the floor.

[Taichi]
"Guwaaaaa!"

I fell to my knees.

[Mommy]
"Ah, you failed! Hehaha! So you do need to eat more. Fatten up!"

[Taichi]
"Uuu."

Yuusa-chan......if you don't leave home soon, you'll be fattened.
Holding over five times the provisions of a common man, I sat down in an appropriate place.

[Tomoki]
"I see you've got powerful connections as always."

Tomoki, holding a tray with the C lunch, sat down beside me.

[Taichi]
"Is that you, Tomoki-sensei?"

[Tomoki]
"I'd like to borrow some of that luck."

[Taichi]
"Please do borrow it."

[Tomoki]
"Are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"I can't eat this much."

[Tomoki]
"Then I won't hold back."

He took the pork cutlets.

[Tomoki]
"I was eating bread with Sakuraba just now, but it wasn't filling enough."

[Taichi]
"He was in sports clubs, after all."
//Using "used to be" with a past tense verb is just plain effed. I think this form gets the same emphasis across. - pondrthis

[Tomoki]
"But he's not even doing strength training anymore."

[Taichi]
"Just having muscles consumes fat. That's why muscular guys have bad mileage."

[Tomoki]
"Ehh? Then it's better to not have muscles?"

[Taichi]
"Of course not. They keep your figure from gaining extra fat. It's better to just do strength training in moderation."

[Tomoki]
"I see."

[Taichi]
"Is Sakuraba still having curry bread?"

[Tomoki]
"He was on his seventh when I left."

[Taichi]
"Wow."

[Tomoki]
"He says the stuff they get here is his favorite curry bread."

[Taichi]
"Stupid tongue of his."

[Tomoki]
"It is a stupid tongue."

We ate.

[Taichi]
"Dammit, we eat and we eat and it won't get any smaller!"

[Tomoki]
"......should I take it off your hands?"

[Taichi]
"Please do."

[Tomoki]
"Hey, there are crabs in your miso!"

[Taichi]
"......there are."

[Tomoki]
"What are your connections......?"

[Taichi]
"The world's strongest submission, a trout hold (son-in-law engagement)."

[Tomoki]
"You're referring to that oba-chan's daughter?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Tomoki]
"I wonder if she looks like her mother."

[Taichi]
"No, she's an amazingly cute girl with glasses. And she's attached to me. She'll believe anything I say."

[Tomoki]
"Then there's no problem."

[Taichi]
"No......"
[Taichi]
"I, who will likely ascend to an aggressive job of my own which will make me fit to hold a Swiss bank account, cannot be meowing after an honest girl."

[Tomoki]
"You're talking in your sleep."
[Tomoki]
"Ah, Taichi, how was your adaptation coefficient exam?"

[Taichi]
"Any way you look at it,"

I gulped down the self-served wheat tea.

[Taichi]
"Severely high. Unacceptable. My teacher's eyes went white when he saw it."

[Tomoki]
"How much?"

[Taichi]
"......eighty-four percent."

[Tomoki]
"Uwa, if only that was a percentile."

[Taichi]
"Exactly. Isn't that bad? I might become something horrible."

[Tomoki]
"You might get dissected for research purposes."

[Taichi]
"Have mercy."

I clung to his sleeve.

[Tomoki]
"Impossible......you're living in a different world from my seventeen percent."

[Taichi]
"What? Hey! Why's your number the same as a normal person's!?"

[Tomoki]
"......I had external obstacles, remember?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's right......"
[Taichi]
"I'm so stupid. I'd been thinking of us as equals."

[Tomoki]
"You shouldn't be saying that."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, Raba's (Sakuraba's nickname) is pretty low as well."

[Tomoki]
"I think he was fifteen."

[Taichi]
"Weren't his obstacles internal? Why did he get sent to Gunjou with that number?"

[Tomoki]
"Well, it seems he wrote Gunjou down as his preferred school."

We looked at each other's faces.
Both of us: "Haaaa!!?"

[Taichi]
"......that makes no sense."

[Tomoki]
"......I know."

[Taichi]
"National exams are pretty half-assed."
[Taichi]
"Ah, on that note, you'd better make up with your onee-san."
[Taichi]
"You keep saying it's too hard and that you never get around to it."

[Tomoki]
"That's because Onee-cha......Aneki would betray me......"

Didn't this guy nearly say 『Onee-chan』 just now?
(TL Note: "Aneki" is a more formal and impersonal version of "onee-chan.")
......whatever.

[Taichi]
"Miyasumi-sempai would?"

Tomoki and Mimi-sempai were siblings.
Though their surnames are different.

[Tomoki]
"What do you think of the argument that I had to 'help' because I was a 'computer nerd?'"
//The feeling I got from this is that one or both of those should have quote marks.-Spin
(TL Note: "Going Home Club" is a euphemism for not having a club.)

[Taichi]
"Come on..."
[Taichi]
"Does it even matter? You're practically in the Going Home Club anyway."

[Tomoki]
"Well......in any case, this place doesn't have a Basketball Club."

[Taichi]
"But you can't even run."

[Tomoki]
"Well..."

[Taichi]
"Give it up. It's nice not to have any annoying upperclassmen."
//Before you ask, he didn't say sempai. He said joukyuusei. 〜IX

[Tomoki]
"I was hoping to read all the manga I wanted to when I got into the Going Home Club."
[Tomoki]
"Why do I have to get into a sports club and make up with Aneki after all this time?"

[Taichi]
"......your siscon is palpable."

[Tomoki]
"Did you say something?"
(TL Note: "Siscon" = "Sister complex." The intent is virtually identical to "lolicon" and other complexes.)

[Taichi]
"Nooo I diiiidn't."

All that aside, I'm helping out with the club now.
What do I do with this part?
Does it go here?
Or here?

[Taichi]
"......"

I'll put it here for now. This feels like the right spot.

[Misato]
"You can tell where it goes?"

[Taichi]
"Well, somehow."

Sempai was holding the stepladder below me.

[Misato]
"It's encouraging to have a boy here."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"
[Taichi]
"Anytime you are in need, I shall......"
//To "have need" tends to require an indirect object (have need of...), even when you're talking super-fancy. - pondrthis

Come to think of it,
Doesn't she have a brother?

[Taichi]
"......umm, are you fighting with Tomoki?"

Sempai's face became overcast.

[Misato]
"Aaah, well......"
[Misato]
"There's a bit of a cold war."

[Taichi]
"So even Tomoki gets in fights."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"That guy doesn't get seriously mad all that often."

It seemed Sempai received a shock from those words.
//Gah, more MOON. flashbacks. I almost misspelled it on purpose this time. 〜IX

[Misato]
"......it might be perfectly natural."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"He's got this, 'Dammit, life is hard!' kind of feeling."

I didn't understand that.

[Tomoki]
『......you'll be betrayed.』
//Requesting old line check here. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Umm, was there some kind of betrayal?"

Her eyebrows narrowed.

[Misato]
"Did Tomoki say that?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Sempai?"

[Misato]
"......nooo, nooo."

Sempai looked like she was about to cry, and she was moaning, 'nooo, nooo.'

[Taichi]
"Ummmm?"

[Misato]
"What did you say!!?"

She jostled the stepladder back and forth.

[Taichi]
"Wawawa!!?"

[Misato]
"Nothing will come of that!!!"

[Taichi]
"I'm going to fall!!!"

It was a harsh club.
