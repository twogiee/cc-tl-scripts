No one's here.
I have a feeling I haven't seen Touko here for a few days.

[Taichi]
"I know you don't like it, but would you try coming to the club tomorrow?"

I had a soliloquy.
I had been planning to say that if Touko was here.
If we're going to enjoy our youth, we should all do it together.
Diary writing will be worthwhile today.
By the way, 『diary writing』 isn't a grammatical mistake.
Since 'diary' is a noun.
I scratched my head as I wove together such things that I could color my forehead with.
*Color my forehead with = Taichian for 'learn from.' Taichi made this mistake when he thought that 『Knowledge colors the self like a picture frame.』
//This might just be the single most untranslatable line I have ever seen. 〜IX
//Tried to make it make sense by turning 'put in my forehead' into 'color my forehead with' O.o - Sheeta
If possible, I'd like everyone to gather on Sunday.
(TL Note: One of the kanji for "picture frame" also means "forehead")
Aaah, I can't record Sunday in the diary.
But, I want to see that scene at least once.
The reset just might be a very scary phenomenon.
Identical to death.
That's why......at least......

[Taichi]
"I'll try inviting her......"

I headed for the post office.
I stormed the post office.
I robbed it of about thirty postcards.
On the way home, I passed in front of the kouban defiantly.
Since I felt like it, I also stormed the kouban.
This is the first time I've been in one.

[Taichi]
"Hoo, so this is the inside of a kouban..."

I wonder if there are any handguns.
There were handcuffs.
There was nothing else of value.

[Taichi]
"Not good."

I don't have time to be doing this.
I hurried home.
I wrote a postcard.

[Taichi]
"Now then......"

All around,
It was a busy night.
