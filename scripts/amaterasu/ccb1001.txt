I killed some time.
It became evening.
I wonder if Sempai is still here.
The temperature seemed to have loosened alongside my memory.
The indigo curtain I could see from the roof had already taken on a crimson tinge.
There was no gust of wind blowing.
A time of twilight as quiet as a neutered cat.
No one's here.
I looked around for Misato-sempai.

[Taichi]
"Ah."

She was lying beside the antenna.

[Taichi]
"There she is."

She's sleeping.

[Misato]
"......"

Soft, regular breathing.
That sound, which didn't even overcome the background noise, possessed a mysterious musical quality which numbed my thoughts.
In, out, in, out.
Gentle, harmless breathing.
Her natural, undecorated form.
It held no lies.
No impurity.
When sleeping, everyone returns to an innocent age.
*stare*
Her closed eyes cannot behold the clarity of dusk as it envelops the earth.
For a long time,
I watched Sempai,
With envy and admiration.

[Taichi]
"......"

I wonder how long I did that for.
Her healthy breathing ceased, and her eyelids shuddered.
Her long eyelashes twitched subtly.
Her eyes opened slightly.

[Taichi]
"......you really are great, Sempai."

[Misato]
"Ah......what......?"

With her sense of language dulled, Sempai's voice was as artless as a child's.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"......Kurosu......kun?"

[Taichi]
"I'm Peke."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun......"

That nickname she just recited is reserved only for Sempai's use.

[Misato]
"......nn, don't......"
[Misato]
"Don't watch me sleep......"

She covered her pupils with both arms, and her body writhed faintly.
Everyone wants to hide their defenseless form.
And that desire to hide means there are lies within one's normal self.
So that also applies to Sempai.
......I cut off those cold thoughts.
Sempai finally got up.

[Misato]
"When did you get here?"

[Taichi]
"Just now."

[Misato]
"......hmmm."

A suspicious look.

[Taichi]
"It's true."

I tried surrendering by raising both of my hands.

[Taichi]
"I don't tell lies to Sempai."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, it's dangerous to nod off in the middle of the day."
[Taichi]
"You could dehydrate or get sunstroke."

[Misato]
"Mm, that's true."

She held back a yawn.
Her glasses were crooked.
My hand moved.

[Misato]
"Eh......?"

I took her glasses with both hands and gently repositioned them.

[Taichi]
"Now Sempai's back to normal."

[Misato]
"......that's dangerous too."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Misato]
"That side of Peke-kun is dangerous."

I think she's a bit mad.

[Taichi]
"What side? How so?"

[Misato]
"Think about it while looking in a mirror."

[Taichi]
"Haaaan!!!"

Uwa, this girl's saying things that make me want to cry!

[Taichi]
"You mean......I'm ugly!!? Uwaaaa, you know I'm sensitive about that!!!"

[Misato]
"Eh, no that's not......"

[Taichi]
"Hideous......I'm hideous......Mommy......"

[Misato]
"Aaaah, you know that's not what I meant, right?"

[Taichi]
"Because I was born hideous......"

[Misato]
"I'm trying to say-"

[Taichi]
"That's okay, I know I'm ugly. It's perfectly natural. I'm a disgusting man."

[Misato]
"No, that's not......well, your face did surprise me the first time we met."

[Taichi]
"......"

Well, your face did surprise me the first time we met.

[Taichi]
"............"

Well, your face did surprise me the first time we met.

[Taichi]
"........................"

Well, your face did surprise me the first time we met.

[Taichi]
"Ha, hawawa, hawawawawa......"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"Gyuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!?"
[Taichi]
"Wiiion! Wiiion!" (Alarm)
[Taichi]
"Guii, Guii, Piiwian!" (Propulsion Sounds)

[Misato]
"Wa! Peke-kun's state of mind is-!"

[Taichi]
"My name is Creator, the existence which rules humanity!"

[Misato]
"Wa, wa, Peke-kun's a trite creationist from a twenty-year-old video game!?"

[Taichi]
"Wherefore doth thou disobey me? Within my control thou shalt enjoy eternal peace!"

[Misato]
"Question."

[Taichi]
"What be it?"

[Misato]
"Why are you using such unnaturally old diction?"

[Taichi]
"Gogogogogogogogogogogogogogo!!"

[Misato]
"I'm sorry, it really doesn't matter!"

[Taichi]
"Star Buster ready to fire!"

[Misato]
"Ei!"

[Taichi]
"Gufu!"
[Taichi]
"......haa, where am I?"

[Misato]
"Thank goodness, you're back."

[Taichi]
"How strange..."

[Misato]
"What happened?"

[Taichi]
"I was told something incredibly shocking, and I had a dream where I got revenge with the humanity annihilation bomb Star Buster, but......I can't remember the shock which motivated me to do so."

[Misato]
"So it was that kind of bomb......"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, what was it..."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun is too concerned about looks. Remember, people are souls."

[Taichi]
"My looks......?"

Ah, that's right.

[Misato]
『Well, your face did surprise me (with its ugliness) the first time we met.』

[Taichi]
"Ooooooooo."

[Misato]
"Again......"

[Taichi]
"Geronimo!!!"

[Misato]
"......who?"

[Taichi]
"Uu, hiku, egu!"

[Misato]
"What should I......?"

Sempai was flustered.

[Taichi]
"Sempaaai!"

I tried hugging her. (daringly)

[Misato]
"......uu."

Sempai's body stiffened for a moment.
Her arms loitered in midair.

[Taichi]
"It's not like, I wanted to be born ugly......which is why I'm trying to live cleanly......to avoid bringing pain to others"......*sob*......

[Misato]
"AaaaAAA."

Sempai's body gradually lost its stiffness.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

She held me softly.

[Taichi]
"......"

I buried my face into her full bosom.
Buried it around and around.
I could smell her sweet flesh through her uniform.
I was getting dizzy.
A hint of sweat.
Strangely, that too was fragrant.
And sooooft.
Squishy to no end.

[Misato]
"......nn......"

My restlessly moving face must have been tickling Sempai.

[Misato]
"Excuse me......"

I continued pretending to cry.

[Misato]
"I mean it."
[Misato]
"Regardless of how you look, Peke-kun, your eyes are really deep and pretty."

Hesitation.
But that dissipated in an instant.

[Misato]
"......if you approach me so suddenly, I'm going to be startled."

[Taichi]
"Are you sure?"

[Misato]
"Yes, that's why I told you to look in a mirror."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"Will you stop crying now?"

[Taichi]
"......yes."

I removed my face with a broken heart.
Who knows when this kind of opportunity will come again.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, you're quite the crybaby."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"You're going to burn bridges if you keep that up."

Burn them, burn them, my heart cried out.
Scorch me to the bone...

[Misato]
"Maybe you'd like to become my little brother?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

Immediate decision.

[Taichi]
"I hope our relationship as siblings shall blossom in the future."

[Misato]
"Eh!?"

[Taichi]
"I'll get my things right away, so wait at your house."

[Misato]
"What!?"

[Taichi]
"But should I have a look around the place first? After all, I need to know whether siblings sleep in the same futon or not."

[Misato]
"Ah, umm, you know, Peke-kun......"

[Taichi]
"To be honest I've always been lonely at night......thank you, my nee-san......no, you deserve to be called hime-nee-sama."

[Misato]
"Wha...what should I do?"

Sempai whispered in the direction of the day after tomorrow.

[Taichi]
"I'm kidding."

[Misato]
"......"

Her expression became something unfriendly before my very eyes.

[Misato]
"Peeekeee-kuuunnn!"

[Taichi]
"I thought it would soften the mood."
[Taichi]
"Was I wrong?"

I tried pretending I was about to cry again.

[Misato]
"Uu."
[Misato]
"......"

A sigh.

[Misato]
"Seriously......that's not fair."

[Taichi]
"Not fair?"

[Misato]
"That's a private matter."

Although she seemed to be fuming a fair bit,
I think she's forgiven me.
Sempai truly is kind.
As we wasted time, the night approached.
Daylight hours ended, and the darkness came upon us.
