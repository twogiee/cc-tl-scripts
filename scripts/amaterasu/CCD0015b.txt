"I surrender."

[Kiri]
"Please don't move. I'll shoot......eh, eh?"

[Taichi]
"I surrender."

Before she could tell me to put my hands on the wall and spread my legs, I put my hands on the wall and spread my legs.
The posture of surrender.

[Miki]
"Weaaak......"

[Kiri]
"......what do we do, Miki?"

[Miki]
"Uhhh......now that you ask that......I feel sorry for him."

[Kiri]
"There's no need to feel sorry for this person."

[Miki]
"But, Kiri-chin holding a weapon is too one-sided. It's not good to point that at people......"

[Kiri]
"......but..."

[Miki]
"Stop it, okay?"

[Kiri]
"......I understand."

She was reluctant, but...

[Taichi]
"May I lower my hands?"

[Kiri]
"......go ahead."

[Taichi]
"Fuuu, thanks Miki."

[Miki]
"Ah, no problem."

She's a good girl.
Now then, I have to do 'that' to one of them.
