[Taichi]
"Here we are: the beach."
[Taichi]
"And now, here are the reliable faces who shall enjoy this summer day overflowing with libido!"

The group lined up.

[Misato]
"......"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Miki]
"......"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Now, here we go."

I walked along the line with the tight step of a sergeant.

[Taichi]
"What's with these faces that make it look like we're gathered here for a funeral?"

[Touko]
"That's because you tricked us!!"

[Taichi]
"Mmm...aah, I don't remember that."

I dug out some earwax.

[Touko]
"Yooouuuu aaaarrrreeee..."

[Taichi]
"Why are your feet scratching along the ground?"
[Taichi]
"Is it biology?"

*slap!!*

[Taichi]
"Gofu!"

An accurate attack hit my cheek hard, producing an onomatopoeia identical to the name of the act.

[Karade Master]
"More than half of the human body is composed of water. If you try hard enough, you can be a water balloon."
[Karade Master]
"A single attack received from that pliant yet tenacious palm moving slightly downward. She's tuned into your cranial fluids to impart upon your brain a tremor surpassing that of the common punch."
//Goddamn that was fun. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Who's that?"

........................

[Touko]
"I'm going home!"

[Taichi]
"Well, well."

*yank*

[Touko]
"Kiaaa!!? Where are you grabbing on to!!?"

[Taichi]
"The part of your swimsuit covering your butt."
[Taichi]
"This swimsuit material can really stretch."

[Touko]
"Molester!"

[Taichi]
"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh."

I sunk into the sand.

[Taichi]
"......uuu......"

[Touko]
"I-I can't believe this, you perverted monkey! Are you an idiot!? Are you an idiot!?"

Touko was fuming as she fixed her swimsuit.
I saw all of her butt crack.

[Misato]
"......my stomach..."

Sempai couldn't stand watching others fight, so she was already groggy.

[Taichi]
"Today is the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club's sea bath. Let's begin."
[Taichi]
"Now, listen up. I won't be saying this twice. You are all scum! You have the foulest breath of any pigs in the country!"
[Taichi]
"As you are among the lowest and most vile of living things, the country's upkeep of you has not come cheap. They're making an investment, but they've seen no profits in return---"

[Misato]
"Are we all new conscripts?"

[Tomoki]
"It's Number 10."
//I found the Japanese wiki page for this manga, but I can't figure out what it has to do with the situation. 〜IX

[Kiri]
"............defeated......"

Kiri lowered her head, quite sick of this.

[Miki]
"I'm sorry for tricking you. Sempai said he needed me to."

[Kiri]
"......today......I had planned to go out and eat sushi with my family......"
//This line always makes me feel bad. 〜IX

[Miki]
"Hey, if we do this favor for Sempai now, won't it come in handy later?"

[Kiri]
"Salmon roe, sea urchin, medium tuna, jika......"

Ignoring the military play, Kiri let a heavy sigh fall to her feet.
(TL Note: "Jika," literally "market price," refers to asking the waiter what everything costs on a given day before ordering, because sushi ingredients have highly unstable prices.)

[Misato]
"So, through what means did you bring Kirihara-san here?"

[Touko]
"Hasekura-sempai said she had something important to talk to me about."
[Touko]
"I never thought such an important person would side with Kurosu......"

Her iron fist was shaking.

[Misato]
"Hasekura-san......just what kind of relationship does she have with Kurosu-kun?"

[Taichi]
"Nn? Youko-chan?"

[Touko]
"Youko-chan!?"

[Misato]
"Youko-chan!!?"

[Miki]
"Youko-chan!!!?"

[Tomoki]
"Youko-chan!!?"

[Taichi]
"Nice quartet."

I flicked my conducting baton.

[Touko]
"Wh-why is such an amazing person being addressed with '-chan' by a dumpster like yourself!?"

[Taichi]
"There's a limit to how much you can avoid putting oblaat over your words."

[Miki]
"Sempai, Sempai, question, question."
(TL Note: "Oblaat" is the Dutch word for the starch-based translucent water-soluable material used to coat certain medicinal pills to make them easier to swallow.)

[Taichi]
"Yes, Miki-Miki."

[Miki]
"I am Miki-Miki. Ummm, are Kurosu-sempai and Hasekura-sempai going out, by any chance?"

[Touko]
"No! That cannot be allowed!"

[Misato]
"Hieee, beauty and the beast!"

[Tomoki]
"......truly frightening......what is happening to the world......?"
[Tomoki]
"To think that a --- like Kurosu has a girlfriend! On top of that an extreme cool beauty like Hasekura-sempai!"

[Taichi]
"......you'd better not think you can run your mouth all you like just because I'm not looking at you."

[Miki]
"So, what is it?"

[Taichi]
"......we aren't going out or anything."
[Taichi]
"Youko-chan is merelyyy, my meat slave♪"
//Might be a little too literal here. 〜IX

A little devil's smile.

[Misato]
"Huu......"

[Miki]
"S-s-s-sergeant-donooo! Miyasumi-sempai has swooned!!"

[Tomoki]
"Lies! Jehovah, tell me that's a lie!!"

[Kiri]
"......umm, Shima-sempai......I do think it's a lie, so you really don't have to face the sea and pray to the almighty......"

[Touko]
"Ah, that valiant Hasekura-sempai......has been so......stained by Eros......it hurts......my head hurts......"

Hey, you've got the unrivaled destructive power.

[Taichi]
"And a one-two!! Three-four!!"

This feels nice.
They're all running themselves ragged over something as trivial as garbage. That's moe.
//Okay, you don't really need a TL note 'cause it's SOOO nubish to ask... but please clarify what moe actually means in the forum :( all I know is cute. - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"Two-two!! Three-four!!"

[Touko]
"-ut up!! Stop that dancing!"

[Kiri]
"......perhaps, this is...fate."

[Misato]
"Buku, buku..."

[Miki]
"S-s-s-sergeant, your Majesty!! Miyasumi-sempai is blowing bubbles!! Bubbles!!!"

[Tomoki]
"On your knees!! Beg for your life! Get the stone back from the brat!!" (currently deranged)

[Miki]
"Ah, that's......"
(TL Note: This appears to be a quote from the movie "Laputa: Castle in the Sky.")

[Taichi]
"You're thinking of using that cannon in a shootout against me?"

[Touko]
"What are you all saying......?"

[Taichi]
"Swimsuit, gal, if they come upon beach sand there must be beach volleyball. This is a convoy."

[Tomoki]
"Get the stone back from the brat!!"

[Taichi]
"This guy's getting annoying......"

[Miki]
"Won't beach volleyball make our breasts jiggle?"

[Taichi]
"Yes! After all, there could be no other reason for beach volleyball to be anyone's long-cherished ambition, and though I was fully intending to pass on any position which would overuse one's chest---"

[Miki]
"......everyone, that seems to be intentional, so be careful."

[Taichi]
"Be at ease, Miki-jou."

I patted her head.

[Miki]
"Nnku?"

I like Miki because she doesn't mind this sort of thing.
She's the number one moe girl among the underclassmen.

[Taichi]
"Three years from now yours will be bouncing too."

[Miki]
"......uhaa......s-seriously?"

She's embarrassed.

[Miki]
"It'd be nice if that happened."

[Taichi]
"I know these things. You shall develop!"

[Miki]
"Th-thank you so much."

[Taichi]
"Kirihara's nearing the age where growth ends, so she'll be staying flat."

[Touko]
"Yooouuu aaarrreee..."

[Misato]
"Nn......it's noisy here......"

Ah, she revived.
Pushing herself up with one hand, her buxom chest bounced weakly as her body bent.

[Taichi]
"Sempai, you've got beautiful breasts."

[Misato]
"EEH?"

[Taichi]
"Beautiful."

[Misato]
"Wait, Kurosu-kun......"

[Girl]
"Ummm..."

[Taichi]
"Just like the forbidden fruit. Even though I'm not Adam, I feel like I'll be bewitched."
//No Christian overtones at all in a game called CROSS+CHANNEL... this is the second "TLN?" and second christian reference! - pondrthis

[Misato]
"I'm-I'm going to be raped......"

She squatted, held herself, and shivered violently.

[Tomoki]
"W-will you stop that!?"

[Taichi]
"Dammit, this is no joke. Aren't you yourself holding a few too many immoral emotions toward your sister? Mister Siscon-kun?"

[Miki]
"Now you're the yakuza."

[Tomoki]
"Who are you calling a siscon!?"
(TL Note: "Yakuza" = The Japanese equivalent of the Mafia.)

And yet, he became a little flustered.

[Misato]
"No-not my body..."

[Girl]
"Ummm, excuse, excuse, excuse, me!!!!!"

One moment.
All movements stopped.

[Taichi]
"......Yuusa-chin?"

[Yuusa]
"I-I'm Yuusa. S-s-s-s-sorry to intrude while you're all busy."

She lowered her head as if apologizing.

[Yuusa]
"Uh, umm, I am honored to have been invi-invi-invi......ow!"
[Yuusa]
"............(crying)"

She seemed to have bit her tongue.

[Touko]
"And who might you be?"

[Yuusa]
"Haa...I'm Doujima Yuusa."

[Touko]
"Are you someone's acquaintance?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, mine."

*gossip*
//yep, it's a sound effect in Japanese. Dunno if we should try to adapt it any further. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"......what is the meaning of the atmosphere being pulled toward an infinite minus?"
//Dunno how much non-engineers use the words "source" and "sink", but "infinite minus" is so shitty I might as well suggest a construct with "sink", "toward a fun sink?" There should be a better one... - pondrthis

[Misato]
"Is she your friend, Kurosu-kun?"

[Taichi]
"My girlfriend. We're cohabiting."

[Yuusa]
"......!"

*stare*

[Miki]
"Co-"

[Touko]
"habi-?"

[Misato]
"N-not again..."
[Misato]
"That's not true, right Ojou-san?"

She spoke directly to Yuusa-chan.

[Taichi]
"Eeh, that's riiight. We're living together, aren't weeee?"

[Yuusa]
"......(nod)"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Misato]
"......huuu..."

[Miki]
"Ah, she swooned again."

[Taichi]
"Juuust kidding♪"

[Touko]
"......that's what I thought."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, that's how honest this girl is. Be nice to her."
//You know, this might've been the easiest adaptaion of "yoroshiku" I ever got handed to me. Thank you Taichi. 〜IX

[Miki]
"So you're called Yuusa-chan? I am Yamanobe Miki."

[Yuusa]
"Ah, very pleased to meet you......"

They bent forward to shake hands.

[Tomoki]
"......lovely."

[Taichi]
"Whut!?!"

Th-this woman stealer......is after Yuusa-chan......he's after MY Yuusa-chan!?
//Think this adds a better effect.-Spin
Desired surveillance target selected.

[Taichi]
"Well, you really came."

[Yuusa]
"Okaa-san said to take care."

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

I whispered into her ear.

[Taichi]
"Did Youko-chan bring you all the way here?"

[Yuusa]
"Ah, yes. But she never said a word."

[Taichi]
"Whyaa?"

[Yuusa]
"D-did I do something to make her mad?"

[Taichi]
"No, that's normal. Don't worry about it."
[Taichi]
"So, where is she?"
//The following lines make it sound like this is what he was asking.-Spin

[Yuusa]
"She was with me up until now, but then she suddenly disappeared."

[Taichi]
"......"

She's around here somewhere.

[Taichi]
"Ah, there she is."

There's no mistaking that silhouette.
She was even wearing a swimsuit. Such a waste......

[Taichi]
"......"

Technically, she did 『participate』 in our group sea bath.

[Taichi]
"Well, it doesn't matter."

[Yuusa]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Now, since Yuusa-chan's here, let's play."

[Touko]
"That was a long buildup."

[Miki]
"Let's split into teams."

[Touko]
"Do I have to do it too?"

[Miki]
"The number of people..."
[Miki]
"The two male sempais, please split up."

[Taichi]
"Male sempais......wait, aren't you forgetting something?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, that's what I thought."

[Taichi]
"What was it?"

[Tomoki]
"Hmmm..."

I couldn't remember it.

[Miki]
"Kiri goes here. Then Kirihara-sempai and Miyasumi-sempai go there."
[Miki]
"Then, Yuusa-chan will enter our small-bodied team."

Okay, okay.
Miyasumi-sempai's over there.
Shaking...they'll be shaking...
My thoughts raced around Miyasumi-sempai's wonderful boobs.

[Taichi]
"Guah!"

[Miki]
"......umm, we're starting now."

[Taichi]
"Without any warning?"
[Taichi]
"Ow-ow-ow, dammit, who was that just now?"

[Touko]
"......hmph (turns away)."

Her...

[Taichi]
"The filthy Japanese army may have planned their Tora Tora Tora attack before declaring war..."
//I feel like they should be capitalized. Still hisitant though.-Spin

I held up the ball in my hand.
(TL Note: "Tora Tora Tora," literally "Tiger Tiger Tiger," was the radio message sent by the bomber pilots to indicate the success of the Pearl Harbor attack.)

[Taichi]
"Our American army obtained that information a long time ago!"

[Touko]
"Iiidiot."

[Taichi]
"Ah, you are irritating...that attitude, yep, irritating."
[Taichi]
"Since you irritate meee......attack!"

I attacked.
Tomoki returned it without difficulty.
Damn, he was an ex-sports club member.
The ball came to us once again, and this time, Miyasumi-sempai returned it.

[Misato]
"Ah, here it is......"

She meandered in all directions.
The received ball hit Kirihara Touko in the back of her head.

[Touko]
"Fui!?"

[Misato]
"I-I'm sorry..."

[Touko]
"......no problem."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."

[Touko]
"-hut up!! Don't laugh!"

Touko's serve.
In Yuusa-chan's direction.

[Taichi]
"There it goes..."

[Yuusa]
"Eh! Ah! Ya!?"

Crap, her specs aren't that different from Miyasumi-sempai.
I signaled Sakura Kiri with my eyes, since she looked like she had good motor skills.

[Taichi]
(Sakura) (Yuusa-chan) (Save her)

She returned my signal with her own gaze.

[Kiri]
(Why) (Do I) (Have to do that?)

[Taichi]
(Without) (asking) (you're good) (at sports) (right?)

[Kiri]
(Troublesome)

[Taichi]
(Are you) (a devil?)

[Kiri]
(It's) (not) (my field.) (If you want to save her) (do it yourself.)

[Taichi]
(Cheater) (Bully) (Lonely wolf)

[Kiri]
(I don't know) (myself) (very well)

Those sorts of talks took place.
It might've been my delusion.

[Yuusa]
"Ah! Spin! Spinning!?"

She's saying 'spinning' out loud.
This is hopeless.

[Miki]
"I'll!"

Miki jumped in.
She runs (she slips).
Splendidly (tumbles).
*fump*

[Miki]
"............"

Since Miki jumped in face first, the ball fell onto her subpar butt.
//Ouch...sorry Miki. But he just couldn't leave it at flat chest jokes. 〜IX
//The picture that's displayed tells a different story about her "subpar" butt.-Spin

[Touko]
"Second point."

[Taichi]
"I'll admit only that there is love in your heart."

[Miki]
"Sh...shempuai......"

Miki's raised face was red.

[Taichi]
"Blood......you're bleeding."

[Kiri]
"Miki!!?"

[Miki]
"Ow, owwww, my forehead hurts..."

[Taichi]
"Blood, blood is......blood is......"

The sand was filled with broken fragments of something.
Blood.
A shock went through my back.

[Kiri]
"No, it's torn apart!"

[Miki]
"It hurts......"

[Yuusa]
"I'm, I'm sorry, it's all my fault......"

[Miki]
"I don't care about that......it hurts..."

[Taichi]
"Tea, here's some tea!"

I passed a can of tea to Kiri.

[Kiri]
"What are you doing!?"

[Taichi]
"I just said tea!"

I held out the tea to avoid looking at the blood.

[Miki]
"It stings! It stings!"

[Kiri]
"Uhh, what should we do...in this......huh?"
[Kiri]
"I don't know......I don't know what we should do, but......"

Kiri was coming apart.

[Taichi]
"I said TEA!!"

I was also coming apart, and no useful words would come out.

[Miki]
"Owowowowow......uhyaaa, I'm bleeding......what should I do...?"

[Misato]
"Are you okay!?"

[Touko]
"I'll go call a doctor!"

She ran away.

[Taichi]
"TEEEEAAAAA----------!!"
//Think we should make it "this tea" just for the memetic hilarity? 〜IX

[Yuusa]
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

[Miki]
"Blood's pouring...! My head stings!"

[Tomoki]
"I...is there anything I can do? Hey, is there something I can do?"

You're the only one here with a clean bill of health!
Many people cried out, and many people were befuddled.
I was also frantic since I didn't want to look at blood.
I closed my eyes.
"............"
Someone took the can from my hand.
The sound of the pull-tab opening.
//I forgot what the English expression is for opening this kind of can, so I went hyperliteral for a change. 〜IX
The sound of something pouring down Miki's forehead.

[Miki]
"Funya?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes, that's it."

[Tomoki]
"Wh-what're you trying to do by pouring tea on it?"

[Taichi]
"......actually, the catechin included in green tea has a sterilizing effect."
[Taichi]
"There's a handkerchief in my bag, so put that on her."

[Tomoki]
"O-okay."

I opened my eyes.
Right then, Misato-sempai started applying the handkerchief.
Ho!

[Taichi]
"Miki, does it hurt?"

[Miki]
"It stings a bit."

[Taichi]
"Who was it who found the tea?"

[Misato]
"Well, about that......"

[Tomoki]
"I don't know."

[Taichi]
"Say what?"

[Misato]
"When we were all in chaos, I think I saw someone out of the corner of my eye."

[Tomoki]
"Likewise."

[Yuusa]
"Me too......I think......"

If there was a super ninja-like human capable of reading our awareness level with such skill......
It's her.
I looked around the area, but didn't see her.
Of course I wouldn't.
Then, Touko brought over the lifeguard.
Everyone wilted at once.

[Miki]
"Th-thank you very much......Sempai."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Miki]
"Because you kept on screaming, 'Tea! Tea!'"

[Taichi]
"......I was confused too. I don't know why I wasn't able to explain properly."

[Miki]
"I'm grateful......"

[Taichi]
"To the person who found the tea."

[Miki]
"Same goes for Sempai."

Her teary eyes looked straight at me.

[Taichi]
"......I see."
[Taichi]
"You're a charming gal."

[Miki]
"Nyaa."

Then, Miki was taken away by the lifeguard.

[Kiri]
"I'll go with her. You sempais can go home now."

[Taichi]
"That's not happening. Right?"

[Tomoki]
"Mmm."

[Misato]
"We'll be waiting."

[Kiri]
"......ummm......thank you."

She thanked me awkwardly, then followed Miki.

[Taichi]
"Yuusa-chan, aren't they great?"

[Yuusa]
"Eh? Ar-are they? They all seem very adult...it's like......I'm the only child here."

[Taichi]
"Do those two look sexy to you?"

[Tomoki]
"Well, compared to Yuusa-chan they are much older."

[Taichi]
"......"

You're calling her '-chan?'
Isn't that a bit soon?
Does this guy just naturally have all the attributes of a woman-stealer?
Definitely a priority target.
In my heart, Tomoki's surveillance level went up by one.

[Yuusa]
"But......they're all good people. Those two and the sempais."

[Taichi]
"That's the unity of two who have eaten out of the same pot. Do you envy it?"

[Yuusa]
"Ah, yes, a lot."

[Taichi]
"You'll have friends like that soon enough."

[Misato]
"......Doujima-san...are you going to Gunjou?"

[Yuusa]
"Yes, it looks that way."
[Yuusa]
"I was planning......to go to a private school, but..."
[Yuusa]
"......I messed up on the adaptation exam......"

[Taichi]
"Fear not. We all did."

[Misato]
"Yes, yes. Our school definitely doesn't allow bullying, so it's very comfortable."

[Yuusa]
"......okay."

[Touko]
"Hey, weren't none of us here when this girl entered?"
[Touko]
"And she's being far too nice to you. Is she an idiot?"

[Taichi]
"All who cannot understand Roman should go eat bad ramen in a seaside house."

[Touko]
"What's that mean?"
(TL Note: "Ramen" refers to various kinds of noodle soups, many containing meats, vegetables, miso, etc.)

[Taichi]
"What's with you?"

[Tomoki]
"Stop it......Doujima-san's getting scared, you know."

Hey, hey, you trying to be her knight now?
Surveillance level is now three. Four would indicate a severe hazard.
You think I'll allow this?!

[Taichi]
"Ah!!"

I collapsed.
My hand reached Tomoki's swim trunks.

[Taichi]
"Uwaa."

*slide*
Shima Tomoki. Height: 172 cm. Weight: 59 kg. Penis Length: 12 cm.
That organ, equipped with a force resembling that of the brontosaurus ready to face the final evolutionary process, was now exposed before the eyes of a young and helpless girl (and doubly so).
//No idea what the () part is referring to. 〜IX
//Two young and helpless women. Yuusa and Touko. - pondrthis

[Yuusa]
"........................"

[Tomoki]
"Uu, uwaaaaaa!!?"

[Yuusa]
"........................"

That pure and innocent girl who'd never seen her father's, now, slowly, without a single change in complexion, and without a single scream......fell down unconscious.
Kirihara ran away somewhere after seeing Tomoki's (newly dubbed) Super Dragon Bogack.
//Try to find a TLN for Bogack. What the hell is that for a dick? - pondrthis
Considering how noisy her mouth is, she's awfully weak.

[Misato]
......*muttering*

Miyasumi-sempai nursed the unconscious Yuusa-chan.
Even that sempai was half-disgusted and half-embarrassed, such that her face turned crimson.

[Taichi]
"Oh no, sorry."

[Tomoki]
"Be more careful!!"

[Taichi]
"I'm sooorry."

[Tomoki]
"......this is the end."

End, end now.

[Taichi]
"Don't get depressed. Do you think I've forgotten our vow to remain the 'cherry boys' until graduation?"
//NAT, and "wakarimasen lol." 〜IX

[Tomoki]
"That is true..."

His shoulders collapsed.

[Tomoki]
"Haaa......shall we swim?"

[Taichi]
"I'll join you."
[Taichi]
"But that aside, Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"It's been bugging me for a while now, but..."

[Tomoki]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Isn't this Sakuraba?"

[Tomoki]
"......hmmm."
[Tomoki]
"I guess someone stepped on him during the excitement."

[Taichi]
"He's alive."

[Tomoki]
"This guy won't die that easily."

[Taichi]
"I thought we were one short."

[Tomoki]
"This is a stupid sea bath."

[Taichi]
"But it was fun."

Tomoki sighed, agreeing with me.

[Tomoki]
"......I guess so."

Our fun sea bath ended there.
Miki's wound left a very small scar.
Even so, she was bright and cheerful on the way home.
As if she'd gained something through being hurt.
It was that kind of face.

[Misato]
"Sorry, I have something to do at school."

[Taichi]
"Something to do?"

[Misato]
"The club. I need to set things up."

[Tomoki]
"You really are serious."

[Misato]
"......Tomoki's always being sarcastic."

[Kiri]
"That's not true."

[Misato]
"Eh, really?"

[Miki]
"He doesn't say that to anyone besides Miyasumi-sempai, does he?"

[Kiri]
"That's right. Shima-sempai is admirable."

[Tomoki]
"Thank you for the compliment, but please stop, it's embarrassing."

[Miki]
"We made him mad."

[Kiri]
"......we sure did."

They looked at each other's faces and giggled.

[Yuusa]
......*giggle*

Yuusa-chan followed their lead awkwardly.

[Misato]
"Then let's split up here. Everyone did great today!"
