Was Kiri coming to school?
It wasn't mentioned in the records I saw for Monday.
The fourth floor. The first year classroom.
Kiri was there.
She was staring at the scenery.
A small physique.
She was filling herself with fresh vitality without becoming stiff.
From what I could see of her face, there was a pinch of anxiety there.
Her black hair rippled, habitually covering her forehead.
Her young vitality covered by a fragile film of glass......a girl who ought to be loved.
//Yes, that's "film" instead of "pane." ã€œIX
Being hurt breaks off fragments, so she sometimes hurts others.
But the back holding her slender shoulders up was delicate, and even looked defenseless.
......so much so that I might attack it.
She appeared to have not noticed my presence.
