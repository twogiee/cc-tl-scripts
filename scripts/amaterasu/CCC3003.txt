I walked home.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

In the end, I spent the day doing nothing.
Maybe it's because I knew everything would be reset?
I just couldn't get into it.
Besides......even after going to school, I didn't feel any liveliness or prosperity.
The world was becoming a shell.
You can't call this a world with only eight people.
An eternal summer.
Are we the remains of humanity trapped in an eddy of time?
Or perhaps......a different meaning...
I stood still partway up the hill.
The grove of trees on the side of the road.
I remember.
I remember......
Shinkawa Yutaka was staring at the grove of trees.
I moved toward Shinkawa, and called out to him.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

Shinkawa was sweating.
It didn't look like summer sweat.
I stepped back.
A car came.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa!"

Shinkawa was run over and killed. That traumatized me.
......nothing like that happened.

[Taichi]
"Ah, it's the Tasaki Shop's pickup."

That flashy guy passed by slowly at thirty kilometers per hour.
The old man with rich facial features waved his hand at me, saying 『Thanks for everything!』
Since I'm one of his customers.
I turned to him.

[Taichi]
"Thanks for all the Shouwa-era beverages!"

An*sa.
Me**ow Yellow.
Nepo*.
Pepper Captain.
Gato**de.
Legendary soft drinks.
As a former railway otaku, I guess it makes sense he'd be maniacal about his business.
I don't know how he supplies them.
Anyway, Shinkawa didn't die.
He's just peachy.

[Taichi]
"You were hovering between life and death just now. If I hadn't grabbed onto your arm like that, those gray brain cells of yours would've made a gory painting on the asphalt."

Shinkawa was shaking.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa?"

[Shinkawa]
"Ah......sorry."

He regained his senses.

[Shinkawa]
"Somehow......when I look into something like a grove of trees......I start feeling horrible......I've been like that for a long time......though I have no idea why......"

He covered his face as he stood up, and looked dizzy for a while.
Then he looked up at the blue sky, and sighed as if panting.

[Taichi]
"............"

[Shinkawa]
『One of my legs doesn't move very well.』

I'd thought his obstacle was external.
There aren't many in Gunjou, but there were students with long-standing external obstacles.
But Yutaka's different......it might really be internal, if I think about it now.
Within the forest,
Closed space surrounded by trees.
It's a weakness of mine too.
A long time ago, something happened which dug into the wounds in my heart.
I was able to understand Shinkawa's feelings, and therefore a little bit of my own.
