I returned to my room and turned on the lights.
A lot had happened, and I was tired.

[Taichi]
"It's still hot..."

I need to get my AC repaired soon.
There's another AC in the living room downstairs, but for some reason I can't relax down there.

[Taichi]
"Maybe I should take a bath."

I did take a bath.

[Taichi]
"Nnna?"

The bath felt so good that my consciousness had been going to the other side, then the doorbell called me back.

[Taichi]
"Crap."

I got out in a hurry and wiped my body.
I put on my kimono and went for the door.

[Taichi]
"Yes-yeees."
[Taichi]
"Who might you be?"

[Yuusa]
"Uh, umm, I'm Doujima."

[Taichi]
"That cute voice hiding underneath a gangster-like surname......Yuusa-chan? It's open, come in."

The door opened timidly, and a pretty girl was standing there.

[Yuusa]
"Good eveni......ng."

Her eyes opened wide.
Her formerly black pupils now reflected my form.

[Taichi]
"Good evening."

[Yuusa]
"That's a...kimono."

[Taichi]
"Oh, this thing? Surprised?"

[Yuusa]
"It did surprise me......"

[Taichi]
"I like priests."

[Yuusa]
"Haa."

[Taichi]
"That and it's comfortable."

[Yuusa]
"Umm...it suits you."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Yuusa]
"That is, since your hair happens to be white......it matches that color."

[Taichi]
"Maybe so, but black hair is best for kimonos."

I gave a wry smile.

[Taichi]
"I think someone like Yuusa-chan would be better suited to one."

[Yuusa]
"Th-that's......hic!"

At the moment her voice rose up, she hiccuped.

[Yuusa]
"Hic......hic......hic."

[Taichi]
"Arara."

[Yuusa]
"Hic......I'm sorry, hic......"

[Taichi]
"It doesn't seem to be stopping."

From what I've heard, I just have to surprise her.
If this was Kirihara, then I'd just open up the front of my kimono without hesitation.
But to surprise this girl......

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."
[Taichi]
"Yuusa-chan, look this way."

[Yuusa]
"Hic?"

I closed in on the pretty girl's face that looked up at me.
I approached within five centimeters, and whispered,

[Taichi]
"Let's get married."

[Yuusa]
"------!!??"

Yuusa-chan froze.
For a whole minute, she didn't budge.
Her hiccups stopped.

[Yuusa]
"Uh, umm, that was...?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it just came out."

[Yuusa]
"Umm, just now?"

[Taichi]
"Make yourself at home."

[Yuusa]
"......just now, what exactly happened......?"

I sat her down and served her wheat tea.

[Yuusa]
"Where are your parents?"

[Taichi]
"I don't think they'll be coming home tonight."

[Yuusa]
"Eh!?"

Her expression became complex.
Undoubtedly, she was imagining complex circumstances.
Though they actually are rather complex.

[Taichi]
"They always stay at company hotels when they're this busy with work."

[Yuusa]
"Aaah, I see......"

[Taichi]
"So, what exciting news have you brought for me today?"

[Yuusa]
"That tone sounds like a character in a foreign novel."
[Yuusa]
"Umm, today's my birthday."

[Taichi]
"Oooh? It was today?"

I didn't know that.
Taichi-kun, careless.

[Yuusa]
"About that, this is......my birthday present."

As I unconsciously accepted the thing covered in wrapping paper, the inside of my head filled with 『?』s.

[Taichi]
"Ummm......anyway, thanks. But, why?"

A birthday present?

[Yuusa]
"It's thanks for always looking after me."

I've definitely been looking after something good then.
Or maybe, she's trying to make me like her. Tentatively.
I thought that I could mitigate the minus of my appearance by kindly interacting with her throughout her childhood.
My plan for a 『Grand investigation into whether Hikaru Genji was ever really satisfied』 had now gathered enough data to make a favorable judgment.
I finally noticed something that I hadn't thought much of after I'd succeeded at it.
(TL Note: Hikaru Genji is the protagonist of The Tale of Genji, which is primarily about his epic womanizing.)

[Yuusa]
"Also, I thought the exchange diary was due tomorrow, so......"
(TL Note: This is most likely a reference to Genji's effort to raise a little girl into his perfect wife.)

She twiddled her fingers strenuously in her lap to try and calm down.
She looked down, and the part of her neck I could see was perfectly red.
Her heart seemed full to the brim with something.

[Taichi]
"Moe..."

[Yuusa]
"......eh?"
(TL Note: The slang term "moe" is related to the Japanese words for "burning" and "budding" and refers to something irresistably cute.)

[Taichi]
"Aah, I've been writing in it. I'll go get it."

[Yuusa]
"O-okay."

I went upstairs.
Her diary, and...
I looked around the room.
For something I could give to Yuusa-chan.
It'd be nice if I had some stuffed animals here, but my room had no history with fairy tales or the like.
Fairy tales...
Only sensual.

[Taichi]
"Not good, not good-"

I tried thinking about what I'd want if it was me.
Yuusa-chan's raw panties.
My hands naturally untied her obi, and while maintaining rationality with an iron will, they peeled off even more.
What would I do if I blew away this thing I'd been building up for so long to the horizon in an instant?
(TL Note: An obi is the thick belt of fabric tied around the waist of a kimono or similar garment.)

[Taichi]
"Not good..."

Something fitting for a birthday. Isn't there anything?

[Taichi]
"Ah."

Would this really...?
No, it's just not suited for her character.
I can't let her become aware of my real interests.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Would this have shock value?
Might it work?

[Taichi]
"Hhhhmmmmmm."

From the first floor,

[Yuusa]
"Ummm, Taichi-saaan, I'm going to have to go home soon..."

[Taichi]
"Nuuu."

There's no time to hesitate.
I found and repackaged the box and manual, then stuck it into a paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Sorry for keeping you waiting."

[Yuusa]
"Ah......"

Her face turned to the color of relief.

[Taichi]
"So here's your exchange diary, and on top of that, a birthday present from me."

[Yuusa]
"............"

This girl is always at a loss for words when she's surprised.
I guess I'll explain the present later.

[Taichi]
"Now then, why don't I walk you back home?"

[Yuusa]
"........................!!!?"

She was at an even worse loss for words than before.

[Taichi]
"It's already nighttime, so there are quite a few dangerous people out there."

Especially in this town.

[Taichi]
"Shall we go?"

[Yuusa]
"Y-yes!"

We walked down the night road together.
Yuusa-chan's stride was short, so time flowed by without a care.

[Taichi]
"That's right, tell your okaa-san I'm grateful for all the food."

[Yuusa]
"My mom?"

[Taichi]
"She's always preparing banquets for me."

[Yuusa]
"......well, that's true."

[Taichi]
"Have you gotten used to school?"

[Yuusa]
"You always ask that question, don't you, Taichi-san?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, do I?"

Now that you mention it, I do.

[Taichi]
"It's like a ritual phrase. It's a cushion for the conversation."
[Taichi]
"Still, you've grown up, Yuusa-chan."

[Yuusa]
"Ta-Taichi-san, how would you know what I was like as a child......?"

[Taichi]
"I might say the same thing to you in the years that follow."

[Yuusa]
"Taha, you've already been saying it."

[Taichi]
"Still, I think you've grown since the first time I met you. At least from my perspective."
[Taichi]
"Although one part's still undeveloped♪"

[Yuusa]
"......huh?"

[Taichi]
"Take good care of yourself. Physically."

Though that's impossible.

[Yuusa]
"Eh!? Ea!?"
[Yuusa]
"That's too hard for me to really understand, but......okay."
[Yuusa]
"If Taichi-san says so, I'll give it my all."

She squeezed both hands into fists.

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

[Yuusa]
"Umm, I'm sorry for making you walk me home."

[Taichi]
"It's a natural thing for I, a young adult who's tasted both the sweets and sours of life."

I proclaimed while holding up my index finger.

[Yuusa]
"It's training."

[Taichi]
"Ha-ha-ha."

Is she misreading her obligations in this situation?
So cuuuteee...

[Taichi]
"I would love to assault a girl like you in my bedroom at night."

[Yuusa]
"Your bedroom at night?"

[Taichi]
"Ha-ha-ha, well, forget it, forget it."

[Yuusa]
"I'd thought getting walked home like this was the sort of thing which only happens in novels."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

Come to think of it, this girl liked the Co**lt novels.

[Yuusa]
"I'm a bit surprised."

[Taichi]
"I did just say it, but it's a natural thing."
[Taichi]
"Because there's a group in this world which prevents any combination of the big and the small."
[Taichi]
"They're a pitiful bunch."

Both big and small have their good points.
My philosophy is that, ultimately, either one's fine.

[Yuusa]
"......"

Her face said 'Sempai really does talk about difficult things, since he's an adult.'
Something was stimulated.

[Taichi]
"But 『I』 do not want to become a man with nothing but a long shooting range."

*Rough translation......'That's not to say I'm only into younger women.'

[Taichi]
"I want to become a human who looks far ahead into the distance while still paying attention to their feet."

*Rough translation......'It'd be nice if 『little girls』 spoilt by their elders could also be loved.'

[Taichi]
"The enlightenment I have for the microists might be called a kind of rags to riches story."

*Rough translation......'I want to talk to the diehard lolicons and show them the error of their ways.'

[Taichi]
"There's certainly something fresh about a flat board. I'll admit that. But not all is told through that alone. Whether few or many, people are confronted with problems of mass and shape.

"Whether from lack of life experience, or childhood traumas......the failure of wishing to revolve them all back to nothing out of fear is something I can only see as running away from the problem."
*Rough translation......'They're definitely flat (the rest has been omitted)'

[Taichi]
"Through a concrete set of values, the many and varied things that 『are』 can be classified within a number of models.

"『Bowl-form』, 『Rocket-form』 and such on top of the list, then 『Tsurigane-form』, 『Drooping-form』, 『Blood-form』, many more like that. With viewpoints penetrating subtler matters, things like 『Spearhead collapse-form』 can be reported on......"
I looked down at Yuusa-chan to find that she was writing all this down.
(TL Note: TP)

[Taichi]
"Uwaaaaaa! No! You can't--!!!"

[Yuusa]
"Eh? What's wrong!?"

[Taichi]
"You can't record that!"

[Yuusa]
"Well, it was pretty hard, so I thought I'd try and figure it out later..."

What did she say!?
If she went and researched those dangerous words on the internet...!!

[Taichi]
"It's coming! Take cover!"

I pulled her close and hid in the shadow of a telephone pole.

[Yuusa]
"Wh-what!!?"

[Taichi]
"Stay quiet. This is a battlefield."

[Yuusa]
"This place, which looks like nothing but a peaceful Japanese street, is a battlefield!!?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. And I just felt a hostile soldier's presence."

[Yuusa]
"A soldier!?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe the CIA, or the KGB, there's even the possibility he's from the N*K."
[Taichi]
"They're all intelligence networks with extreme military power."
(TL Note: NHK = Nippon Housou Kyoku = Japan Broadcasting Network, ie one of the biggest TV networks over there.)
[Taichi]
"That last group in particular is so utterly heinous, they've been known to employ guerilla tactics to raid private residences and forcefully rob them of their cash."

[Yuusa]
"Hieee."

[Taichi]
"......he's gone. Okay, it should be fine now."

We returned to the road.
The salaryman we'd happened to pass by on his way home looked at us with a dubious face.
We could make out the sounds of late-night sports broadcasts from various directions on that pastoral night road.

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry. For those reasons, the content of our conversation is classified information. Recording it would put your pure body in danger."

[Yuusa]
"Wh-what?"

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry, but would you mind destroying the pertinent entries?"

[Yuusa]
"Uh, yeah, I'll erase them, I'm sorry!"

With the eraser on the back of her pencil, she rubbed the face of the paper back to default status.
Aah, she'd taken out and used that unstained eraser for this......

[Taichi]
"My apologies."

[Yuusa]
"It's all right. I was at fault."

My chest hurt.
Or perhaps, I hurt.
