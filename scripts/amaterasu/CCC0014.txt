I shrugged my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Actually I do have business here."

Kiri's eyes narrowed vexingly.

[Taichi]
"Is Miki-kun around here?"

[Kiri]
"......she isn't."

[Taichi]
"Did she come here?"

[Kiri]
"......she's not here."

She was in no mood for mulling over the details.
I shrugged again.

[Taichi]
"I've got nothing to go on then."

[Kiri]
"Yes, there's nothing."

I sat in a nearby chair.

[Taichi]
"Weeell, biology is serious. It's such a melancholic time. See, humanity's been annihilated."
//I doubt this is meant to be coherent. 〜IX

[Kiri]
"......"

She stared at me.
She seemed on the lookout for my every move.

[Taichi]
"You know, Miss Innocence..."

[Kiri]
"Please don't call people such names."

[Taichi]
"You know, Kiri-chin..."

[Kiri]
"Please don't call me with such a friendly name."
//Not sure about "with" but "by" seemed weird in that context. I don't know if that's just me overthinking it though.-Spin

[Taichi]
*sigh*

I shrugged for the third time.

[Taichi]
"I really do tease you a lot..."

[Kiri]
"......"

I stood up.

[Kiri]
"......!"

Her lookout strengthened.
She shivered.
Incredibly cute.
The sadistic Masoch that I am can find satisfaction in this character.

[Taichi]
"Huhu......"
(TL Note: Leopold Ritter von Sacher-Masoch is the man after whom "masochism" was named.)

[Kiri]
"......?"

I laughed invincibly. Kiri hesitated.
She lowered her hips, taking a stance from which she could run at any moment.
I moved faintly, standing in front of a certain seat.

[Taichi]
"Wasn't this Kiri's seat?"

[Kiri]
"Please don't drop my honorific......"
[Kiri]
"......especially in your position."

It was like a knife.
Sticking right through me.

[Taichi]
"Sakura's seat."

With slow motions, I tried to sit down there.

[Kiri]
"Stop!"

She screamed at the end of her wits.
I froze in place.

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

[Kiri]
"......you'll defile it."

She seemed embarrassed about getting upset, and her voice lowered even further.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm. Then there's no choice."

I sat down.

[Kiri]
"Ah---"

[Taichi]
"Oooh, it's hot, really hot. I'm Oda Nobunaga..."
//If anyone has a clue what he really means, go ahead and mess with this. 〜IX
//Maybe people will assume he's talking about being on the "hot seat" which, makes sense in this context so it's fine.-Spin

[Kiri]
"......"
(TL Note: A major daimyo, or feudal lord, during Sengoku who lived a life of continuous military conquest.)

[Taichi]
"Silence?"

Kiri's shoulders were shaking.
Was it that mortifying?
She seemed to horribly dislike this.

[Kiri]
"What did you come here for?"

I smiled brightly.

[Taichi]
"For Miss Innocence's innocent chastity."

[Kiri]
"......please go back."

[Taichi]
"But I haven't done anything yet."

[Kiri]
"Do you plan on doing even more?"
//It seemed like she was actually asking him in a nonrhetorical way.-Spin

[Taichi]
"What ever shall I do..."

I worried.
Touching glassware leaves fingerprints.
That sort of hesitation.

[Taichi]
"Fine, I'll go."

[Kiri]
"............"

She ignored me.
Either ignore, or knife.

[Taichi]
"Right after some small talk."

[Kiri]
"Please go back."

I shrugged. The fourth time.

[Taichi]
"Ah, you brought your school supplies."

I searched through Kiri's bag.

[Taichi]
"Today was just the opening ceremony. Ah-haaah, are you the type to bring all your schoolbooks on the first day and leave them here?"

[Kiri]
"Please don't look at that. Please don't touch my bag."

I shrugged. The fifth time.
I was shrugging my shoulders a lot.
This is Sakura Kiri after all.
The girl with the alias Miss Innocence.
//Not entirely sure about this but I think "of" is redundant there. Especially since "Miss Innocence" is capitalized anyway.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Everything I do hurts you, doesn't it?"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Are you tired?"

[Kiri]
"Whose fault......is that......?"

Her voice was shaking. From rage.
She's always blunt, but with humanity's annihilation...
Kiri's quite disturbed, and the wall around her heart seemed to be weakening.

[Taichi]
"It might be my fault."

I chuckled.
I shrugged.
Shrugging at high speed certainly relaxes my shoulders, though the motion is comical.

[Kiri]
"......would you mind......getting out?"

She was desperately controlling her desire to become enraged.

[Taichi]
"......hahi."

I've made her too mad.
I'll walk away.

[Taichi]
"Ah, hey, can we eat lunch together?"

Kiri looked at me blankly.

[Taichi]
"......may I? Well, see you. Tell Kiri-chin that I hope to see her again."

I left the classroom.
