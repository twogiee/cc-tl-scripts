[Miki]
"Heeellooo."

It wasn't long before Miki arrived.
Bringing Kiri with her.

[Misato]
"......Yamanobe-san?"

[Miki]
"I am Yamanobe Miki. I have come."
[Miki]
"Come on, Kiri-chin, greet her."
//Her voice pauses there like a comma so I decided to add it in.-Spin

[Kiri]
"......hello."

[Miki]
"Your voice is too low. I can't hear you!"

[Kiri]
"......he-heeello!"

[Miki]
"Not 'heeello.' It's 'good morning,' isn't it!?"
//Felt a little out of place there. It sounds better this way in that context anyway, especially with the voices.-Spin

[Kiri]
"G-good morning."

[Miki]
"Your 『g』 and 『d』 and 『m』 and 『i』 were too soft. One more time!"

She smacked her butt.
So preciiise!

[Kiri]
"Kya!......Don't hit me......"

Kiri's posture was straightened via her butt.
I want to be straightened too.

[Kiri]
"G-good morning."

She lowered her head.

[Miki]
"Yep, yep."

Miki-chin can be sadistic at times.

[Taichi]
"What the heck was that bow!? Aren't you four degrees short---!---?"

[Miki]
"......you're putting considerable stress on the delicate Kiri-chin. It's best not to do that."

[Taichi]
"Tell me that sooner......"

I felt sad after Miki told me.

[Misato]
"Ummmm, what are you two here for?"

[Miki]
"We've come to participate in the club."

[Misato]
"Ah, but......there's nothing I really need you to......"

[Miki]
"We've come to participate."

[Misato]
"Umm, well, you've been skipping until now......"

[Miki]
"We've come to participate."

[Misato]
"I'd been thinking about doing it on my own, so it's okay if you all don't come......"

[Miki]
"We've come to participate."

Sempai desperately tried to refuse.
So the objective of this club was 'flight.'
//Is it still fresh enough in everyone's minds that they'll know "flight" is the past participle of "flee"? If not, edit. 〜IX
//Yeah, it is for me - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"As I expected."

My power to observe humans is now infinitely near to God's.

[Miki]
"We have come to participate in club activities!"

And Miki kept pushing.

[Misato]
"Ummm......hmmm......"

[Taichi]
"Nothing can be done by averting your eyes from reality. There's nothing left for us to do but rot away here, so let's give up and enjoy the present!"

[Misato]
"Awww, Peke-kun, you're so..."

Cheerfully.
But, strongly.

[Miki]
"Now, your orders."

[Misato]
"Ummmm, that's tough..."

[Miki]
"Eheheh."

[Misato]
"......is Sakura-san helping too?"

[Kiri]
"I-I was just......forced by Miki......"

[Miki]
"Unmanageable lust."

She muttered.

[Kiri]
"Please let me participate."

Kiri said after straightening her back.

[Misato]
"......haa, so it can't be helped."
[Misato]
"Then......I'll have you help......"

[Miki]
"Yaaay, a school youth drama! ......Kiri-chin?"

[Kiri]
"......y-yaay......a school youth dramaaa......haa."

[Misato]
"Still, why so suddenly......?"

[Miki]
"It's the result of Miki's trial and error. Well, don't worry about it."

[Taichi]
"......so it's decided."

[Misato]
"So you'll be participating too."

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry......but Miki is just......"

[Miki]
"......adorable elephant."

She muttered.

[Taichi]
"I do so through my own will, your excellency."

I saluted her as I spoke.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun has become a military man!?"

[Taichi]
"What be saying you?"
[Taichi]
"Kurosu Taichi has not once forgotten his Prussian mentality."

[Misato]
"Aren't you being a stereotypical Mongoloid?"

[Taichi]
"Either way I'm a Japanese-Prussian."

[Miki]
"So it's something like the Japanese Alps."

[Taichi]
"Just as you say."

[Miki]
"Since Sempai and Kiri-chin are both perfectly fine kids, please make use of them."

[Misato]
"......I see. In that case, I'll ask you for help up to your eyeballs."

[Miki]
"For now, I was thinking they could carry necessary stuff that was too heavy for you."

Little devil......

[Kiri]
"......I can't carry anything heavy either......"

Kiri looked like she was about to cry.
For now,
The hokora visit is canceled......
After a few hours,
Club activities ended.
We left the building and looked up at the roof.
We could see the tip of the antenna.
Beside it,
Sempai was still there.

[Taichi]
"......"

Working hard at her club.
Truly like a student.
But that student healthiness of hers is being used for flight.
But that aside,

[Taichi]
"......ho."

I was tired.

[Kiri]
"......ho."

We're that similar?

[Miki]
"That was a fulfilling day..."

That would be the case,
Except that you employed other people.
Waving a baton around while giving orders.

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm going this way."

I walked away.

[Kiri]
"......see you, Miki."

[Miki]
"Yeah, bye-bye."

Footsteps behind me.

[Miki]
"Let's go together until the shopping district."

Miki lined up with me.

[Taichi]
"Let us do so, and do so freely."
//I'm not sure if that second "do so" was a typo so I just left it. Just leaving a note here for you to correct me later.-Spin

I felt tired.

[Miki]
"Weeell, I was able to develop 'those.'"

Miki had done that in the Photography Club's room during our club activities.

[Taichi]
"......if I think about it, aren't there only eight people to show those to? Six if you exclude us."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin said the same thing. So, will you quit the club?"

[Taichi]
"......well, I've hung out with you this far. Do as you wish."

[Miki]
"Ehaha."
[Miki]
"Sempai is strong, isn't he?"

[Taichi]
"Am I?"

[Miki]
"I enjoy watching a man carry stuff. It was worth loaning you to the club."

Was that the only reason......?

[Miki]
"Bravo for your hard work. I'll buy you some juice at the Tasaki Shop."

[Taichi]
"Ha, ha, ha. Thank you very much."

My face was becoming tense.
//Is that another idiom?-Spin
This girl......

[Taichi]
"Well, maybe it's better to have something to do."

[Miki]
"It is, it is."

[Taichi]
"I can think about the little things slowly."

[Miki]
"......let's have our school youth drama this week."

[Taichi]
"What about next week?"

[Miki]
"Nnn. Eight men and women on a journey searching for the survivors of humanity......or something."

[Taichi]
"That would be fun."

In these times.
Until the eight of us become zero.

[Taichi]
"But, I'd prefer to do normal things here."

Since it's humanity's nature, it should be just fine to do what's normal.

[Miki]
"......I see."

We arrived.
Miki really did buy it for me.

[Taichi]
"This really does feel like a normal day."

[Miki]
"Yes♪"

The evening sun shone upon the sky.
It made me think back on the setting sun of humanity.
//The "now," really screwed the dramatic flow of this line.-Spin
