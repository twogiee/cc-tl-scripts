The work continued.
Miki and Kiri don't appear much.
......I guess that's natural.
In fact, I'm abnormal for coming to school regularly.
But, what happened to Sempai?
It was lunchtime.
For food......I'd brought cup ramen from Tomoki's delivery.
I boiled water on the roof and opened the cup.
......somehow, this was different from the club activities I'd imagined.
I'd forgotten.
Humanity was already long gone.
A world of just us eight. No, now only seven.
A lamplight before the wind.
I poured the hot water into the cup ramen.
(TL Note: A Japanese idiom similar to "hanging by a thread".)
I ate.

[Misato]
"......aaah, Peke-kun."

Sempai had come.

[Taichi]
"Good morning. You're late."

[Misato]
"Yes......"

She's depressed.
Her glasses were hazy.

[Taichi]
"There was a shocking occurrence."

[Misato]
"Yes, very."

She sat down near me and looked up absent-mindedly at the sky.

[Taichi]
"......you'll feel better if you talk about it."

[Misato]
"I...had a fight with Tomoki."

[Taichi]
"Haa, with Tomoki? I do that a lot."

Sempai smiled as if tired.

[Misato]
"Not that kind of fighting. Something different."

[Taichi]
"Is that what they call 'complex family circumstances?' Do you want a bite of this?"

Sempai shook her head weakly.

[Misato]
"......we have no other siblings, but......we just can't get along well."

[Taichi]
"Tomoki is also quite obstinate."

[Misato]
"The cause......lies with me."

She silently urged.

[Misato]
"Because I'm such a chatterbox."

[Taichi]
"Are you now?"

[Misato]
"......I was wrong."

She scorned herself, and played with her hair.

[Taichi]
"Then, you're the same as me."

[Misato]
"......is that so?"

[Taichi]
"I'm also very bad. That's why I'm here."

[Misato]
"......huhu, then you'll be suspended."

[Taichi]
"Together with Sempai."

[Misato]
"Then why don't we both get suspended and go do bad things?"

Sempai smiled like a baby.

[Taichi]
"Thaaat sounds niiice, baaad thiiings."

The iron door opened with a shrill noise.

[Kiri]
"Sempai, stay away from him!!"

Kiri was armed.
That's definitely no water pistol.

[Misato]
"......poeh?"

[Kiri]
"Miyasumi-sempai, please get away from that guy right now!"

[Misato]
"Eh? That guy?......Peke-kun? You can't...address an upperclassman that way......you'll be suspended."

[Kiri]
"He's dangerous, hurry up!"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Misato]
"That water gun......is that a water bow gun?"

[Taichi]
"That's the real thing."

[Misato]
*sigh*

She swooned.

[Taichi]
"Fast."
[Taichi]
"It's your fault you know."

[Kiri]
"......Kurosu Taichi!"

Kiri set her sights on me.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong? You're being spontaneous again."

[Kiri]
"......you killed Kirihara-sempai too!"

[Taichi]
"!?"

Touko...?

[Taichi]
"Hey, that's......"

[Kiri]
"I went to see her, and she'd died......you killed her!"

[Taichi]
"I know nothing about that! Are you serious? Did Touko really die?"

[Kiri]
"Hasekura-sempai, Kirihara-sempai......who's next?"

[Taichi]
"What were the circumstances of her death?"

[Kiri]
"......you already know that."

[Taichi]
"What wounds? What place?"

[Kiri]
"In Kirihara-sempai's home. In her own room."
[Kiri]
"There was one blade sticking out of her chest......"
[Kiri]
"You are obviously the culprit."

What a simpleton---
Youko-chan's death and my existence had confused Kiri.
She was too excitable.
Persuasion would be meaningless.
......crossbows are weak as threats.
Because they can't fire more than once.
If you miss, it's over.
It's not that easy to hit a running person.
It would be simple to seize Kiri, but...

[Taichi]
"There's no other choice......"

This is no way to die.
I concentrated on my lower limbs, intending to invite a misfire from Kiri.

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, don't do this!"

Miki grabbed her from behind.

[Kiri]
"......ah."

The arrow flew.

[Taichi]
"-!?"

The arrow grazed by, thirty centimeters to my side.
Behind me, it stuck into the wall of the prefab tool shed, its tail shaking.

[Miki]
"You mustn't do that."

[Kiri]
"But!"

[Taichi]
"......Miki, thank you for saving me, but you could have been a bit more cautious......"

[Miki]
"Ah, I'm sorry."

[Kiri]
"Don't come any closer!"

I walked up and grabbed Kiri's shirt at the chest.

[Taichi]
"I won't do anything!"
[Taichi]
"......though I do want to send you flying."

I threw her back.
Kiri fell down on her rear.

[Kiri]
"......murderer!"

[Taichi]
"Aan?"

[Miki]
"Stop this, both of you, smile."

[Kiri]
"Murderer! Who are you going to kill next!?"

[Taichi]
"......hey, Kiri, you......you come out at bad times. In the first place, I only just learned that Touko died. Why am I automatically the one that did it?"

[Kiri]
"......who else would do it!?"

[Taichi]
"......you're the one who found her, so...?"

Kiri raised her eyebrows in anger.

[Kiri]
"There's no way I'd kill her......the only one who could do that is a lunatic like you!"
[Kiri]
"Die, just die! If you want to kill that badly then kill yourself! Lunatic! Go to hell! There's only eight people......in this world......what are you doing!!?"
[Kiri]
"Die, die already! Murderer! ......inhuman!"

Noises I couldn't stand to hear.
They invite discouragement.

[Taichi]
"......not beautiful."

If the usual Kiri was a rusted knife,
This is......right now, an uncouth log.
No precision.
No delicacy.
Kiri, since when were you such an unsalvageable person?

[Taichi]
"............"

Doesn't it make you lose interest?

[Kiri]
"......those eyes......those aren't the eyes of a human."

She's talking about my eyes.
Is this an attack?
It's an attack.
Is it okay for me to flip the switch?
Isn't it okay?
......for an enemy.
I looked at Kiri.
Why don't I eliminate you?---

[Kiri]
"Hii......"

It seems she 『read』 me. She has good eyes.
She turned pale in an instant.
Humans die so easily.
There's no need to stab them.
Especially when they have such slender necks---

[Miki]
"Okay, okaaay, that's enouuugh! Graaab!!"

Miki flipped Kiri's skirt.

[Kiri]
"Kyaaaaa!!!"

[Taichi]
"......oh."

Passions awakening.

[Taichi]
"Stripes!"

With the proud face of having just predicted the path of the ball, I screamed.

[Taichi]
"Batter Ou-!!!"
[Taichi]
"Fuu, your underwear was striped after all."

[Miki]
"Aaah, he's back, he's back, yaaay."

[Kiri]
"......wait......what...don't do that so shamelessly......idiot."

[Miki]
"But...Sempai had started to get angry, and Kiri-chin was being strange."
[Miki]
"All I did was stop you."

[Taichi]
"Ha, I'll be going. I'll try investigating a little at the scene of Touko's death."

[Miki]
"Okay, I'll take care of the striped-panty girl."

[Taichi]
"I leave her in your hands."

I left the roof.
