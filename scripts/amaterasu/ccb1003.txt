[Miki]
"Ah, Sempaiii."

[Taichi]
"Yo."

I ran into Miki as she stood by the wall with nothing to do.
From the looks of things, Miki isn't receiving that much of a shock.
Though she might just be pretending to be fine.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating properly?"

[Miki]
"Ha...thanks to the club, I am, somehow."

[Taichi]
"......you mean the other club."

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Proper Title]
Active Life Maintenance Club.

[Taichi]
"......Kiri-chin's participating too, I'd bet."

[Miki]
"Yes. She's excellent."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, excellent."

[Miki]
"It's strange that Sempai isn't participating."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, you there, Kiri-chin and I---"

As I was talking, Kiri-chin came out of the bathroom.

[Taichi]
"Did you flush?"

[Miki]
"Th-th-th-th-the forbidden questionnnn!!?"

*grind*
Kiri ground her teeth.

[Kiri]
"......Kurosu Taichi!"

No honorific?
And treating me like an archenemy?

[Kiri]
"............"

She sent me a cold gaze.
Kiri hadn't changed a bit, behaving exactly as usual.
I was a bit reassured.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, your skin is as beautiful as ever."

I extended my fingers.

[Kiri]
"Please don't touch me!"

I was shot down by a pliant hand.
*shiver* *shiver*  *shiver*  *shiver!*

[Taichi]
"......nice."

[Kiri]
"......ha?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind."

I brushed aside my bangs.

[Miki]
"Awawa, you can't fight."

[Taichi]
"We're doing nothing as savage as fighting."
[Taichi]
"I want this to be a graceful duel."

[Kiri]
"......does that mean you're challenging me to a duel, Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, if you mean a duel at night."

[Miki]
"Po!"

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki."

Kiri pulled Miki's arm and turned her heels.

[Taichi]
"Let's go, let's go, excuse me!"

I lined up with them.
The three of us are very friendly.
Three gorgeous sisters like canola blossoms!
This is a story about the beautiful dream of those three little girls♪
......obviously not.

[Kiri]
"Sempai......"

[Taichi]
"Oh, you noticed me♪"

[Kiri]
"The only one who didn't notice was the Sempai here with the shallow mind."

[Taichi]
"But my mind's gray."

[Kiri]
"We won't know for sure unless we break you open."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."

Kiri didn't laugh.

[Kiri]
"......considering the situation, you're quite carefree."

[Taichi]
"Oh no, don't compliment me so. It's embarassing, you know?"

[Kiri]
"......"
[Kiri]
"But I...I know. That's why..."

[Taichi]
"Ho-eh?"

[Kiri]
"I have absolutely no intention of lowering my guard around you."

The two of them walked away.

[Taichi]
"......haaa."

What was that?
That sweetly pressing......atmosphere.
I called out to both their backs.

[Taichi]
"Aah, you two."

But only Miki stopped and turned around.

[Taichi]
"Aaah......"

I hesitated to say it.

[Taichi]
"Please take good care of yourselves."

A safe spot.
Now that we've been cut off from civilization, managing our health is a serious concern.
Miki energetically pumped her fist, and Kiri looked away after one glance.
