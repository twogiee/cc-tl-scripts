"......now then,"

Since it's before noon, the air temperature isn't that high yet.
I went to the roof alone.
I looked up at the antenna and the iron tower holding it up.
This certainly isn't......a job that can be done alone.
Since we're amateurs, the antenna looked rather distorted.
Its form was like a monster of wavelength and directionality.

[Taichi]
"Now,"

I got to work.
Even so, I had virtually none of the specialist knowledge necessary for this.
But it's fine.
I'll ask Misato-sempai about it all later.

[Taichi]
"This......should go......in here..."

......
............
..................

[Taichi]
"Damn, I don't get this."

Kurosu Taichi is slightly unfamiliar with the conveniences of modern life.

[Tomoki]
"......what are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, I figured if I did this then she'd say 'Peke-kun, you're amazing!' or 'I'm so moved!' or 'I'm getting wet' and kiss me......or something. Yo, Tomoki-sensei."

[Tomoki]
"She's not going to kiss you."
[Tomoki]
"This for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, yep."

Tomoki lazily sat down on the ground.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, thanks."

Canned juice.
Though it wasn't all that cold.

[Tomoki]
"......Taichi...why are you so eager to do this?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, a serious youth-flavored question."

[Tomoki]
"You're making no sense or seaweed."

[Taichi]
"That joke was hilarious."

[Tomoki]
"Hey, hey, don't evade a question you brought upon yourself."

Tomoki pulled out a postcard.

[Taichi]
"You say I brought it on myself, but it was someone else's hands that mailed that."

[Tomoki]
"......why are you working for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Can I ask something too?"

With a serious face.

[Tomoki]
"Mm?"

[Taichi]
"It has to do with......you and your nee-san. Are you okay with that?"

[Tomoki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"It's a serious question."

[Tomoki]
"......okay. What?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

I pushed out my question a little stiffly.

[Taichi]
"Why do you, a person from Kantou, sometimes use 『nan?』 for 『what?』 and 『sou yan』 for 『that's true』 like part of some pseudo-Kansai dialect?"

[Tomoki]
"That question has absolutely nothing to do with Aneki!!"
(TL Note: Kantou and Kansai are two regions of Japan, each of which pronounces certain words differently.)
[Tomoki]
"I'm going home......"
(TL Note: The Kansai dialect is more old-fashioned and "folksy." Kantou tends to be more modernized and borrow more words from English.))

[Taichi]
"Woah, woah, hold up a minute. Rome wasn't built in a day."

[Tomoki]
"Thank you for depressing me, Taichi-kun."

[Taichi]
"Yep. My conversations always take the scenic route."
//Amen, Taichi - pondrthis
[Taichi]
"In other words...think about it, doesn't having an objective give a person something to live for?"
//Was something edited out accidently some time ago? "That" what? Is it an allusion to something that I missed?-Spin

[Tomoki]
"......something to live for."
[Tomoki]
"Once basic needs are met, that sort of thing might be nice."

[Taichi]
"That's why I was enamored with this."

[Tomoki]
"'This'?"

[Taichi]
"Youth Group Grafitea."
[Taichi]
"What flavor do you think this has?"

[Tomoki]
"No, that's not tea."

Tomoki stood up and circled the antenna.

[Tomoki]
"So......that's it?"

[Taichi]
"It's nice to have something to do."

[Tomoki]
"......we do have something. Like looking for materials."

[Taichi]
"At the very least, this club has hope."

[Tomoki]
"You might only be able to confirm your despair, you know?"

[Taichi]
"There's the hope that we can confirm despair."

[Tomoki]
"......I can't understand how you think, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"

[Tomoki]
"Why do you seem to be enjoying this so much?"

[Taichi]
"He-he."

[Tomoki]
"Truly, unbelievable."

Tomoki wiped his eyes with his arms.

[Tomoki]
"All I know......are the materials used in wiring mobiles and antennas."

[Taichi]
"Then help out."

[Tomoki]
"That's it? At least pretend to feel a little more gratitude than that."

[Taichi]
"Idiot, I'm crying on the inside. My tears are even bitter."

[Tomoki]
"It doesn't look that way."

[Taichi]
"It's lame for two guys to get damp with each other's tears, so go do that with your nee-chan."

[Tomoki]
"You're horrible!"

[Taichi]
"Now, if you've made that decision then hurry up and work! The planned broadcast day is tomorrow."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, yeah."
[Tomoki]
"Then I'll go procure some materials."
[Tomoki]
"......Taichi?"

Tomoki's feet stopped in front of the door.

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Tomoki]
"I thought you'd tell me to make up with Aneki no matter what, but instead you tell me to help her out as a brother."

[Taichi]
"Oh no, sibling rivalry is part of a healthy life. I wouldn't stop it."

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"The point being, I was telling you to help me out."

I stuck out my chest.

[Tomoki]
"......aren't you a big shot."

[Taichi]
"I'm the overlord of all adaptation coefficients over eighty."

[Tomoki]
"......even if you're an overlord, I'll still be your friend."
//Same reason as a lot of other edits. It stuck out.-Spin
[Tomoki]
"Because I don't dislike that."

He disappeared into the school building. As if running away.

[Taichi]
"'Because I don't dislike that'......huhu!"

When Tomoki said that, for a moment his face was as red as the limits of humanity would allow.

[Taichi]
"Don't say it if you're going to get embarrassed. Seriously."

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"But, this should get it progressing a bit."

An enjoyable farce of a club.
This could become a precious memory.
So that someday, I'll see enjoyable dreams---
Surely.
Forever.
So I can feel thankful.
I am fighting.
