I swept my bangs aside.

[Taichi]
"I've been a nuisance."

[Miki]
"Thank you for all your hard work."

[Taichi]
"That's right, Miki."

I stood still.
I'd forgotten to tell her something important.

[Miki]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"She says that club activities are going to start up again soon."

[Miki]
"The club?"

[Taichi]
"If your ever feel tightness within your heart, you should give it a go sometime."
[Taichi]
"Since that's what the club is there for."

A glimpse of understanding slowly began to show on Miki's face.

[Miki]
"......okay."

Delight was mixed in there, along with other emotions as well.
