"Now then,"

I swept my bangs aside.

[Taichi]
"I've been a nuisance."

[Miki]
"Thank you for all your hard work."

[Taichi]
"That's right, Miki."

I stood still.
I'd forgotten to tell her something important.

[Miki]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"She says that club activities are going to start up again soon."

[Miki]
"The club?"
//Seems better without the 'is' to me... - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"If your ever feel tightness within your heart, you should give it a go sometime."
[Taichi]
"Since that's what the club is there for."

A glimpse of understanding slowly began to show on Miki's face.
//someone help me with 'look of understanding'? I changed it, but it still doesn't seem right - Sheeta
//This sounds better but I liked "look" as well.-Spin

[Miki]
"......okay."

Delight was mixed in there, along with other emotions as well.
