I betrayed myself.
This is a challenge against fate.

[Taichi]
"Miki, I hate the status quo."

[Miki]
"I see."

[Taichi]
"That's why, I'll fight."

[Miki]
"...you're serious."

That tension didn't matter.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, I changed my mind."

That was truly the nondirectionality of whimsical puberty.

[Taichi]
"And now that I've said that, blasting switch!"

My fingers went around Miki's back to her bra hook!
*grab!*

[Taichi]
"Whaaat!?"

My fingers were intercepted by Miki's!
And she got her hand behind her while facing forward.
What reflexes! What flexibility! And my eyes did not overlook the tag attached to the flash of her bra visible through her sleeve.

[Taichi]
"Then I'll do this!"
[Taichi]
"Single-hook fishing!"

Single-hook fishing is a forbidden move in which you stick your hand into the crotch from behind and reel up the underwear into the air.
It was a midair shame game.
But!

[Miki]
"Nyomyouu."

My fishing hand was stuck when Miki clamped her thighs shut.
I couldn't pull it up like this.

[Taichi]
"You've blocked it!"

Her bare thighs felt great, but the battle plan was a failure.

[Miki]
"......is that all?"

[Taichi]
"Hawawa!"

Miki was giving off the aura of a shounen manga hero who'd gotten seven times stronger after a really short training session.
She's...strong!

[Miki]
"This time I'll make the first move."

Miki smoothly took on a new stance.
As if dancing.

[Miki]
"Sorry!"

I took up my stance.
But, Miki flew to my chest in an instant.
Her narrowed fingertips touched my kneecap, and slowly pushed outward.

[Taichi]
"Ahaaan!!?"

It tickled, and I couldn't stay standing.

[Taichi]
"Th-this move is!?"

[Miki]
"Huhuhu, your kneecap is a surprising erogenous zone."

[Taichi]
"That's too surprising!"

Still, that seriously tickled.

[Taichi]
"I have......been completely defeated."
[Taichi]
"......so that should be about it for the norm."
