[Taichi]
"We would......work well together?"
[Taichi]
"You say......it'd work well between us?"

[Youko]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Hahaha, that's amazing."
[Taichi]
"Then, why don't you make it work well?"

Malice penetrated familiarity.
........................
............
......
Sunday.
However, any sense of the date had disappeared from my head.

[Taichi]
*cough*

[Misato]
"Oh, nice to see you. Ah, Hasekura-san."
[Misato]
"It's been a long time."

Sempai stuck her mop into a bucket and turned to meet us.

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Greeting."

[Youko]
"......hey."

[Misato]
"Why are you so close together?"

Youko-chan and I had come to the roof together.

[Taichi]
"We were just wandering around."
[Taichi]
"Do you mind if we watch?"

[Misato]
"It won't be that fun to watch, really."

She smiled with a tired face.

[Taichi]
"No, I also want to talk to Sempai."

[Youko]
"......nn!......"

[Misato]
"Aaah, then you're welcome here."

[Youko]
"......!......nn............"

Youko-chan's voice leaked out.

[Taichi]
"You've progressed quite far."

While making small talk, I writhed my fingers.

[Taichi]
"The antenna's mostly done, isn't it?"

Sempai lost her expression for a moment.

[Youko]
"........................!"
[Youko]
"......!......"
[Youko]
"......ah......"

Even Sempai soon knew she was acting strange.

[Misato]
"Eh? What is it?"

[Youko]
"It's......nothing......"

[Taichi]
"What about the broadcast channel?"

[Misato]
"Eh? Aaah, that's right......I've nearly got it."

I crossed and bent two fingers.

[Youko]
"Nn......haa......nn............!......"

I inserted only my middle finger into her deepest parts, and rubbed against her rough pleats.

[Youko]
"......no............that's......!!......!!"

I twisted my fingertips around her labia and touched one other narrow region.

[Youko]
"......nn......nnn."

I lightly flicked her clitoris.

[Youko]
"---!"

I pushed into it.

[Youko]
"Hi!"

[Misato]
"Hi?"

I weakened the stimulus.

[Taichi]
"Can we broadcast yet?"

[Misato]
"Aaah, it's not that we can't connect all the equipment at this point......but I wanted to do it according to the original plans."

[Taichi]
"Since there's no interference from other EM waves, why not arrange them to our convenience?"

[Misato]
"If we were near the sea, I'd do that......"
[Misato]
"On the other hand, an antenna this high up with twenty watts of output should be strong."

[Taichi]
"What does Youko-chan think?"

While my fingers were securely devoured, I stopped moving them to ask her.

[Youko]
"......I-I think that's-!......fine......uuu......"

[Misato]
"Aaah, with Hasekura-san's seal of approval, I feel much better."

Restart.

[Youko]
"Hyau!"

She momentarily stood on her tiptoes.

[Misato]
"?"

[Taichi]
"So, the fact that we haven't detected any EM waves nearby really did mean---"

I pulled Sempai's focus into the conversation.
All of my nerves were directed toward caressing.
My fingers traced her vaginal erogenous zone and vibrated with pinpoint accuracy.

[Youko]
"Aaah......no......no......Taichi......"

Effective cotton.
//"cotton?"-Spin
Her pelvic muscles contracted.
//"Crotch" just sounds so vugar.-Spin
Her whole body shook slightly.
The hair on the back of her neck stood up, and goosebumps appeared.
I pushed her even farther.
I stopped my attack on her weak point for the time being and pushed the whole inside of her vagina with my fingers.

[Youko]
"Nn......nn......!......fua......nn............"

A damp feeling came down from her core and built up in my palm.
As I rolled up her flesh, I bent my fingertips into hooks.

[Youko]
"Nnnnn!!! Uuuuuu!!"

She came.

[Youko]
"O-one......"

[Misato]
"One?"

[Taichi]
"A habit of hers. It means nothing so don't worry about it."

[Misato]
"Haa......"

Youko-chan doesn't show herself in front of people much, so some degree of odd behavior would be allowed.
Since there was no doubt that she was a member of Gunjou.
Her degree of perfection on that exam was truly wonderful.
Knowing that an abnormal person definitely won't be overlooked---
//This adaptation is based on my personal guess that the line is implying Youko-chan "bombed" the exam on purpose. If anyone can think of a vaguer way to adapt it that doesn't add this implication, please mention it. 〜IX
Now then,
I took a machine out of my rear pocket.
An ultra rotor using four AA batteries.
That silver object entered Youko-chan's vagina.
Since she was drenched, it slid in nicely.

[Youko]
"......it's!......co...ld......"

[Misato]
"Hasekura-san, you don't seem well."

[Taichi]
"She's always fidgeting and mumbling like this."
[Taichi]
"Please don't worry about it. Well......this is her ultramarine after all."
//Hopefully I don't need a reminder tl note this time. 〜IX

[Misato]
"Aaah, I see."

She easily accepted it.
So, switch on.

[Youko]
"......!!!?"

Her legs squeezed closed.
It made me think, 『be careful.』

[Youko]
"Uuaaa......nn!......stro......"

I set the motor to its lowest setting.
Even that was a significant oscillation.
Not gently raising her pleasure, but forcefully taking her to the summit.
I adjusted it as I pushed it in to make contact with her weak point.
//Old line made it seem like he was adjusting the thing itself to make contact but really, he's adjusting the intensity of it.-Spin

[Youko]
"Nn......!......!---!!"

She isn't acting like herself.

[Misato]
"That must be tough."

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm here too."

Sempai gave a friendly smile.
//Not too sure about this one but "showed" sounded just a little off.-Spin
Thankfully, the wind was loud enough to wipe out the sound of the motor.
She seemed completely unaware of the rotor's existence.
//Oh, if anyone's wondering, I'm not getting "rotor" and "motor" mixed up. Both words are being used. 〜IX
Ah, it came out.
I'll push it back in.

[Youko]
"......kyafu!!......!!!"

She stood on her tiptoes for a while.
I pushed it in further.

[Youko]
"......nnnnnnnnn!!?"

Standing on her tiptoes even more.
Switch to maximum.

[Youko]
"......nnnnnn!......Nn......--------!!!!!!"

She came, she came.
In one moment.
She'd climaxed as if being chased up to a high place.
With her heels held up, unable to return to the floor.

[Youko]
"......hii......t-two-o!......!!!!"

I'd ordered her to report the number of times she cums.
Still, this rotor really is amazing.
Normally, rotors use two batteries, but this one uses four.
On the maximum setting, it rumbles like an earthquake.
And that's what was inside her vagina.

[Misato]
"Your face...it's red......and...you're sweating..."

[Taichi]
"That's normal. In fact, it's evidence she's in good condition."

[Misato]
"Is that so......"

[Taichi]
"If she got worse, there aren't any doctors, so I want her to stay well."

[Misato]
"For only us to have been left alive......it's distressing."

[Taichi]
"It really is."

The two of us nodded.

[Youko]
"......nnnnn, nnnnn, nnnnnnnn! --!!"
[Youko]
"Th-three......"

She's cumming again.
Her intervals are short.
I turned it off.

[Youko]
"......haa, haa."

On.
I changed it to a mode that alternated between the strongest and weakest settings every five seconds.

[Youko]
"......uu!......Uuu......haa......aau......uuu..."
//It sounds so much hotter this way. Seriously though, the dialogue appeared right below the "Youko:". Hope this makes it fit in 1 line.-Spin

[Taichi]
"We must live on, even in these times."

[Misato]
"That's true, it'll be hard."

[Youko]
"A......ya......nn!......Taichiii......"

A crying voice.
I started to pull it out again.
But pushed it back in.
//Makes it sound more masochistic.-Spin

[Youko]
"......aaoh!......Nn!......"

I intentionally pulled it almost all the way out.

[Youko]
"---nnn!!?"

But yet again inserted it as deep as possible.

[Youko]
"Uuuuu!......Aaaa......"

She's amazingly wet.
I tried flipping the rear of her skirt.
It was flowing down from her haunches to her inner thighs, becoming quite provocative.
Countless drops fell to the ground, making a small puddle.
And while I thought that, she made even more of them.
I pushed in.

[Youko]
"............hi!!!?"

A momentary convulsion. A short scream.
Sempai showed her reaction a beat late.
She appeared to be rather overwhelmed.

[Misato]
"Wh-what's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"That's a hiccup."

[Youko]
"That was......fo-ur......"
[Youko]
"......haa, uuu......tight......no......I... can't......"

She's felt all she can.
As I caressed her haunches, her muscles convulsed as if they had a mind of their own.

[Youko]
"......f-five......nn!......-----!!"
//Oh how I envy girls and their almost nonexistent refractory periods.-Spin

She's breathing out sweat.
If I looked down now, I'd probably find she'd suffered incontinence.
It fell to the ground from her inner thighs, sparkling.

[Youko]
"......nn!......no......weaken...it......aku......"

[Misato]
"Somehow......this is making my heart throb...... umm..."

Sempai began to feel something obscene.

[Taichi]
"You'll get used to it. She didn't mean anything like that anyway."

[Misato]
"I see......I guess that's okay."

[Youko]
"......haan, nn, uu!......Haahaa...nn......a......"

Convulsions.

[Youko]
"Six......"

She just keeps cumming.

[Youko]
"......u......uuu......seve......n......nii!!!"
[Youko]
"Nn! Haa, ha!......Aau---"

[Misato]
"My, you're sweating."
[Misato]
"Please use this."

A handkerchief.

[Youko]
"Haa, haa, haa, haa......"

Youko-chan can't move.
She's holding herself and stiffening up.

[Taichi]
"Come on, take it."

[Youko]
"Haa......im-possible......if I moved even a little......I'd......hau!......Nna!!?"
[Youko]
"......eigh-t!............"

[Misato]
"What might this counting mean......?"

[Taichi]
"She actually has a heavy mental sickness that makes her mentally unstable when she's not stretching."

[Misato]
"......haa."

[Taichi]
"She looks like she standing here, but she's actually stretching right now."

[Misato]
"I see, all the mysteries are solved!"

Sempai was relieved.

[Misato]
"That strange fidgeting is stretching, and she's counting those stretches, and her face is red because that exercise is working. Is that it?"

[Taichi]
"That's my Sempai! Mostly correct answers."

[Misato]
"Eh-heh-heh."

'Mostly' since her body is fidgeting because her pu**y feels good.
And she's counting the number of orgasms.
And her face is red because the rotor is putting too much force into her sphincter for it to close.
......although, she's actually close.

[Misato]
"I understand. So I will not worry about Hasekura-san's behavior in the slightest. I respect her."

[Taichi]
"That's great, Youko-chan! Here's someone who can understand you well."

I massaged her anus.

[Youko]
"......uuuuuu............sto-! Noo......It won't, stooop......for......giv............-----!!!!"
[Youko]
"Nine............uuu! And again......teeen......"

Repeated cumming.

[Misato]
"I'll wipe off that sweat for you."

[Youko]
"......ah, no......if you touch me......"

Sempai's handkerchief softly touched her neck (erogenous zone).
At the same time, the rotor I'd turned off touched the deepest part of her vagina.
And then---ignition.

[Youko]
"......kya!......Ah!............e-leven......nnoh! Uu......uuuuu......-----!!"

She held herself, continuing to climax while standing.
At the same time, her physical body renounced consciousness.

........................
With a powerful rotary device, I induced eleven sequential orgasms within Youko-chan until she could no longer remain conscious, much less stand up.
//Should this be phrased "in Youko-chan until she" or something? For some reason I don't remember. 〜IX
//Ah, I changed it to that automatically. I've become psychic! - Sheeta
I wove intricate and laughable lies to prevent Sempai from noticing the entire time. She seemed to accept them wholeheartedly.
//As usual, please tell me if you can suggest any improvements to these lines. Especially since this transition is the most awkward thus far, simply because the hscene ends so abruptly. 〜IX
:yokoHend2

[Misato]
"Ah, Hasekura-san!"

She collapsed.
I caught her.
I stealthily recovered the rotor.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, she did it again......this happens a lot when she stretches too much."

[Misato]
"Yeah, stretching is pretty tough."

[Taichi]
"I'll take her to the health room so she can rest. Bye."

[Misato]
"Okay, see you later."

I carried her on my back and left.
I laid Youko-chan down in the health room.
She'd completely lost consciousness.

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

This was strange.
Anger reacts to strangeness.
When people understand one another.

[Taichi]
"I might go berserk at some point, but let's make this work as best as we can."

........................
Before leaving the school, I looked up at the roof.
That was when Mimi-sempai jumped off.

[Taichi]
"........................"

I saw the moment when the soft Sempai was sucked into and broken by the hard ground.
My emotions flew into an uncontrollable domain.
........................

[Taichi]
"Uu......"

I felt like vomiting.
Several times it felt like my stomach acid was coming up.
The red scenery was simply dazzling.
That's not physical, is it?
Even so, a mental......it doesn't seem that way either.
It's a scene of reality, and 『something』 staining my vision. I was inside a whirlpool of those two things.
Obviously, I hate red.
Seeing it places a high burden on my mind.
It's nearly torture.
That feeling of wanting to vomit was brought on by that burden, which was also my......what could be called, my defense mechanisms for protecting my character.
Pure red eroded away the parts of my consciousness not covered in static.
This sense of abhorrence fulfills the role of a filter.
My body's five senses were dull. I mean they were gone.
I felt like I was sleepwalking, and was conscious of a dull listlessness as if I was lying down.
I'll begin the lecture.
1) Regarding Mimi-sempai
Had she noticed the shameful play I'd done with Youko-chan?
That question has no meaning whatsoever.
2) Regarding Sakuraba
Sakuraba didn't resist.
He might not have been able to understand the situation.
3) Regarding Kiri and Miki
The first thing I should be careful of is Kiri's weapon.
Since they're a pair, Miki might also be carrying a similar weapon.
Normally I'd start with Kiri.
Since she's the one with attack strength.
But since Miki's threat level is an unknown number, I need to be wary of her as well.
I'll investigate how much battle strength Miki has. I established that as the first step in the sequence.
I did it, and it went well.
4) Regarding Touko
She'd died.
5) Regarding Tomoki
He'd died.
His corpse had been moved and hidden inside the prefab structure.
The water inside the mop bucket on the roof was blackish red.
That was all.
6) Regarding Youko-chan
She didn't resist.

[Taichi]
"Ah......"

This sort of thing happened before---
........................
............
......

[Taichi]
"Ah......"

The sun went down.
Together with my rationality.
Have I been growing senile this whole time?
I confirmed the situation I was left in.
First, what day is this?
It's obvious.
Because it was evening when I went out the front gate.
I passed another whole day.
One day passed, and I---
//These two lines are likely this vague on purpose. I have no idea if these are the same day or not. 〜IX
Aaah...an amazing sunset.
A faint shading with a vermillion keynote could be seen through the atmosphere.
I looked down at myself. My shirt was stained black.
The blood of four people.

[Taichi]
"......uuu......uu! Uuuu!......"

I opened my mouth like a beast, and from the bottom of my lungs,
Wrung out a voiceless cry.
The red spread out everywhere---
Sunday...at least, it should be.
//Not sure if he's refering to when time restarts or if he meant the current day. I chose the latter.-Spin
I stood alone on the roof.
Youko-chan had hardly resisted at all.
I looked at her hand.
Both hands, dripping red.

[Taichi]
"............"

It wasn't just Youko-chan lying down.
Everyone was here.
Wait, why did it turn out like this?
It's true the antenna was broken, and everyone gathered, and Tomoki was the culprit, and Kiri held up a crossbow.
Youko-chan ****ed Kiri.
She tried to do the same to everyone who tried to stop her.
Like a ****ing machine.
So I had no choice but to **** Youko-chan.
I said 『It's all right』 to everyone who lived through it, then......who was it......that picked up the knife and pointed it toward me?
As if I was a monster.
I'm not a monster.
Then, I ****ed despite myself.
I ****ed everyone.
I ****ed Miki before she ****ed me.
I broke.
I broke a lot. It was tough.
I have a feeling I ****ed one or two more after that...
Did I **** them because they ****ed?
The other way around?
Which is worse?
It's not in my memory.
Just what was I doing yesterday?
I can't remember anymore.
It's a trivial thing. Compared to today.
Aaah, I did **** everyone.
//God I'm loving this.-Spin
Is there someone who will **** me?
Is there no one?
I lay down.
//Not sure if it's past tense or present but if it's present then switch that with "lie" instead.-Spin
The sky was beautiful.
The sky was filthy.

[Taichi]
"Red---"

Even from me, tears came out.
