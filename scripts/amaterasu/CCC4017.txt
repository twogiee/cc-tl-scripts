Early morning.
I inertially came to club.
The preparations for the broadcasting channel still weren't done.
Tomoki was there.

[Taichi]
"Mornin'."

[Tomoki]
"......is that you, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"What's up?"

[Tomoki]
"......I was thinking, 'this is nearly finished.'"

[Taichi]
"Well, that's because Sempai worked so hard."
[Taichi]
"She even carried the necessary equipment up here."

[Tomoki]
"......when did she say it would be finished?"

[Taichi]
"Sunday I guess. That was the original plan."
[Taichi]
"Will you help?"

[Tomoki]
"Nah, I have something else to do......"

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba left on a journey."

[Tomoki]
"So it seems."

[Taichi]
"He invited me."

[Tomoki]
"Same here."

[Taichi]
"Also, I became a billionaire......"

[Tomoki]
"Wow."

A weak reaction.
His attention lies elsewhere.

[Taichi]
"Touko died."

[Tomoki]
"............what...are you saying?"

His face tightened.

[Taichi]
"Just kidding."

[Tomoki]
"You're such a-!"

[Taichi]
"Are you gonna kill me!?"

[Tomoki]
"......I won't. I'm in no mood for that."

He returned inside the building.

[Taichi]
"Won't you participaaate?"

[Tomoki]
"......I'm fighting with Aneki."

[Taichi]
"Sempai comes here late, so at least help in the mornings."

[Tomoki]
"Hmmm......is there something you don't understand?"

[Taichi]
"I don't get the wiring or this equipment."

[Tomoki]
"Then I have no choice."

Tomoki helped out only for the morning.
