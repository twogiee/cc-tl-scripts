The cicadas are noisy.
Even in this heat.
Those guys are always giving it their all.

[Taichi]
"Even so,"

What am I going to do from now on?
With the roasting sun above the roof, there weren't many places I could go to cool down.
I tried peeking into a nearby classroom, but as I feared, there was a class in session.
Year 1, Class E. Machiko-sensei is teaching in there.

[Taichi]
"......"

I was never able to initiate even a superficial exchange with her.
It was all too normal.
Now she's a stranger.
Anyway, if I keep loitering in the hallways, someone's going to find me.
In the vacant cafeteria, I bought a meal ticket.
To the club room.
Tomoki was reading a manga magazine.
We made small talk.
In the middle of it, Mammoth passed by and we panicked.
After he moved on,

[Tomoki]
"That was dangerous."

[Miyuki]
"We ought to put a curtain up on the window facing the hallway."

[Tomoki]
"That's prohibited. The school's onto that trick."

[Taichi]
"I've got an idea."

[Miyuki]
"......"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Aah, I'm well aware of what you both think of me, but this is no stupid joke. This is a seriously good idea."

[Miyuki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, start up the machines. And get me a digital camera."

[Tomoki]
"Haan?"

......
............
........................

[Taichi]
"How does that look?"

[Tomoki]
"Ah, camouflage..."

I taped a full color print titled 『Empty Room』 to the inside of the window glass.
The viewing angle is a little off, but it's enough to fool passing glances.

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, with this we might not get caught."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."

I was proud.
Then Miyuki returned from the bathroom.

[Taichi]
"How was the bathroom?"

[Miyuki]
"Aaan!!"

She cried.

[Miyuki]
"I never even said I was going to the restroom!"

[Taichi]
"If you come back wiping your hands on a handkerchief, anyone can figure it out!"

[Tomoki]
"You really-"

[Miyuki]
"Even if you notice it, please don't say it."

[Taichi]
"No good! No good! You're too full of openings!"
[Taichi]
"You can't have too many openings! Nor too few!"

[Tomoki]
"What kind of standard is that......?"

[Taichi]
"Guidelines for a proper lady."

[Miyuki]
"I don't want to be one."

I was amazed.

[Taichi]
"Wh-what a loose thing to say."
[Taichi]
"You need punishment, punishment! Punishment! Punishment!"

I circled Miyuki while making noises.

[Miyuki]
"Uuuu."

Miyuki was afraid.
Damn this plain girl.
That plainness only stoked my fire.

[Taichi]
"Punishment! Punishment! Punishment!"

So I slowly flipped her skirt.

[Tomoki]
"H-hey, hey."

[Taichi]
"If thou art wearing woolen panties, thine sins may be forgiven."
[Taichi]
"However! If you are insolently wearing something like thin shorts, theeeen-"

[Miyuki]
"Auuuuu!"

[Kiri]
"Hii-yaa!!"

This voice?

[Taichi]
"Gaaa!!?"

[Kiri]
"You enemy of women!!!"

Was that an axe kick from behind yes it was.
My consciousness slowly muddied......then it revived the moment before departing.
*splat*
If I had passed out, I wouldn't have felt the sharp pain of banging my face into the floor.

[Taichi]
"......kuu......that hurts...underclassman."

Her glaring eyes forced me to take cover.

[Kiri]
"You can tell at a glance who's at fault here."

[Miyuki]
"Uh, umm, and you are...?"

[Kiri]
"A transfer student just passing by."

[Taichi]
"Oh, oh, this is a scene to be painted, Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"Please, for my sake, don't talk to me like we're friends."

Tomoki coldly distanced himself from me.

[Taichi]
"Damn you, you hypocrite."

Whatever.

[Taichi]
"Hey, underclassman, tell me your name before I send you to your grave."

[Kiri]
"Molester!"

[Taichi]
"You're replacing me!?"

[Tomoki]
"Your idiocy is endless."

[Kiri]
"I'll report this to the teachers."

[Taichi]
"Ho, the teachers. I wonder which teacher you intend to upset, ozeu-san?"

[Kiri]
"It doesn't matter who."
[Kiri]
"Besides, wasn't that sexual harassment!?"

[Tomoki]
"......I haven't known Kurosu that long, but-"
[Tomoki]
"I'm glad to say that the number of times I've heard the phrase 'sexual harassment' has increased by leaps and bounds. Thank you."

[Taichi]
"Don't mention it, my friend. It is a natural virtue."

[Kiri]
"To flip a girl's skirt in broad daylight...... you're despicable!"

[Taichi]
"Oooh? Aren't you high and mighty."
[Taichi]
"So are you going to tell that to the teachers?"

[Kiri]
"Yes I am!"

[Taichi]
"Now, I wonder if our heroine-chan of justice has thought about this:"
[Taichi]
"Why would I be flipping someone's skirt slowly, in front of witnesses and in broad daylight?"

[Tomoki]
"......didn't you just want to enjoy her reaction!?"

Mid-level straight punch.

[Taichi]
"And, why this Discipline Board Chairman, Shima Tomoki, made no effort to stop me."

[Tomoki]
"What!?"

[Kiri]
"It, couldn't be......"

[Taichi]
"It can, and it is."
[Taichi]
"That is to say, I possess the greatest authority within this institution!!"
[Taichi]
"Right, Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"Don't turn to me."

[Kiri]
"You two...!!"

[Tomoki]
"Hey!! I'm not part of this!"

[Kiri]
"Unforgivable. Absolutely, absolutely unforgivable!"

[Tomoki]
"I'm not even on the Discipline Board in the first pla-!?"

Mid-level straight punch.

[Taichi]
"Hu-hu-hu."

I stuck my hand into my pocket, closed my eyes as if meditating and with the bearing of a villain,

[Taichi]
"That is to say, I possess the greatest authority within this institution!!"

My eyes flashed open along with the ending of the final word.

[Tomoki]
"You already said that."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Tomoki]
"Although I guess the first time you said it was a little too early."

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"I'd been told that the Gunjou Institute didn't allow bullying......"

[Miyuki]
"Umm, I'm not being bullied or anything."

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

[Miyuki]
"These people are always like that. They don't have any bad intentions."

[Tomoki]
"People? Not person?"

Tomoki was unnerved.

[Taichi]
"People......"

I was unnerved.

[Tomoki]
"What reason is there for you to be unnerved by that!?"

[Taichi]
"I'm no hypocrite!"

[Tomoki]
"And I have nothing to do with this!"

[Taichi]
"You think that'll work!?"

During that struggle,

[Tomoki]
"Lightly-seasoned Machiavellist!"

[Taichi]
"Siscon Murder Incident!"

[Tomoki]
"Lower classes, lower income!"

[Taichi]
"Earth debris!"

[Tomoki]
"Lone survivor of the stock market crash!"

[Taichi]
"D-d-d-don't talk about my stocks!!"

[Kiri]
"Is their friendship breaking!!?"

[Miyuki]
"Aaaaah......"

[Tomoki]
"You're the one trumpeting around lies that I'm a professional siscon masturbator!"

[Taichi]
"You said it! You said it in front of girls! Everyone, rejoice!"

[Tomoki]
"Since then you've started calling me a professional!"

[Taichi]
"But it's the truth!"

[Tomoki]
"What I'm saying is also true!"

[Taichi]
"Damn you!"

[Tomoki]
"What did you-!?"

*bop* *bop* *bop* *bop!!!*
And then,
We both self-destructed.

[Tomoki]
"Uuuuuu."

[Taichi]
"Gugugu."

We both collapsed face-up in the hallway.

[Miyuki]
"......should I take you to the health room?"

[Taichi]
"Wh-what about the ally of justice?"

[Kiri]
"Sakura Kiri. I'm no ally of justice."

She said while looking down at us.

[Kiri]
"......also, both of you understand that evil is undeserving of admiration."

Tomoki exploded abundantly.

[Tomoki]
"I-I have nothing to do with this. It's all Taichi's......"

Tomoki curled up like a beetle larva.

[Tomoki]
"It's okay. I'll go into seclusion."

He was sobbing.

[Miyuki]
"That's not......"

[Kiri]
"She says it's okay, so I'll overlook this ungainliness just this once."

[Taichi]
"......when my body can move again......I'll remember......what you did to me, Kiri."

Kiri sneered.

[Kiri]
"Go right ahead."

That was how I met Sakura Kiri.
