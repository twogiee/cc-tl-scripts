All that aside, I'm helping out with the club now.
What do I do with this part?
Does it go here?
Or here?

[Taichi]
"......"

I'll put it here for now. This feels like the right spot.

[Misato]
"You can tell where it goes?"

[Taichi]
"Well, somehow."

Sempai was holding the stepladder below me.

[Misato]
"It's encouraging to have a boy here."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"
[Taichi]
"Anytime you are in need, I shall......"

Come to think of it,
Doesn't she have a brother?

[Taichi]
"......umm, are you fighting with Tomoki?"

Sempai's face became overcast.

[Misato]
"Aaah, well......"
[Misato]
"There's a bit of a cold war."

[Taichi]
"So even Tomoki gets in fights."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"That guy doesn't get seriously mad all that often."

It seemed Sempai received a shock from those words.

[Misato]
"......it might be perfectly natural."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"He's got this, 'Dammit, life is hard!' kind of feeling."

I didn't understand that.

[Tomoki]
『......you'll be betrayed.』

[Taichi]
"Umm, was there some kind of betrayal?"

Her eyebrows narrowed.

[Misato]
"Did Tomoki say that?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Sempai?"

[Misato]
"......nooo, nooo."

Sempai looked like she was about to cry, and she was moaning, 'nooo, nooo.'

[Taichi]
"Ummmm?"

[Misato]
"What did you say!!?"

She jostled the stepladder back and forth.

[Taichi]
"Wawawa!!?"

[Misato]
"Nothing will come of that!!!"

[Taichi]
"I'm going to fall!!!"

It was a harsh club.
