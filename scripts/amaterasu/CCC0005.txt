"But if this was supposed to be my lunch, you could've just left it on my desk."

[Youko]
"I wasn't able......to go to the power plant......"

[Taichi]
"The power plant? You couldn't go there?"

I didn't understand.

[Youko]
"............"

She was silent.
Dammit.
She's always like this, only giving the rough outline.
Because she only speaks the minimum words needed for her to understand something.
I could ask her about it, but it took time to reach understanding going from the inaccurate doubts and questions on my end.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you mean you went and confirmed it? That far away?"

[Youko]
"Because it was dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, I see......"

It's true that whatever happens to the power plant could be dangerous.

[Taichi]
"So you came to report that."

She nodded.

[Taichi]
"I see......good work."

She nodded.
Happily, if only a little.
I removed my hand.
Her white chinaware cheek was red and slightly swollen.
Even so,
What did she mean by, 'I couldn't go?'
Did she mean she physically couldn't reach it because of a landslide or something?
The facility is needed, but the land around it is difficult terrain.
But saying for sure that it's safe......that's what getting confirmation is.
Nnn...

[Taichi]
"What do you mean, you couldn't go there?"

She'd left.
In the brief moment my eyes had left her.

[Taichi]
"Haa......"
