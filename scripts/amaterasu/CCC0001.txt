The Broadcasting Club campout.
Us first-years are advancing a grade, and happy third-years are retiring.
A new school year is coming.
With seven new faces.
But actually, eight.
I felt that 7/8 was okay.
She......she'd come the moment I called her anyway.
Just to gather seven people,
The price I paid wasn't cheap.
At the same time, I definitely didn't gain much.
In fact you could say it was a loss.
Rage.
Envy.
Hatred.
We hurt each other and broke apart.
That was our campout.
That was one reason the faculty didn't participate.
These are private club activities after all.
Mischief kept secret from the Institute.
If this was made public, there'd be some noise.
But I thought it was fine.
If I can control myself,
If she's conducting surveillance on us,
I thought that the worst possible scenario could be avoided.
What did I want to do......by going to such lengths?

"......"

I even chased out Sempai...
With that, the campout ended in the midst of pain and sorrow.
The seven went home.
I didn't want to see,
The emaciated, wearied eyes avoiding one another, not interacting.
Everyone's faces were like strangers to each other.
That's why I took the lead.
On the way, the sun began to sink.
I had the feeling we'd been walking for a horribly long time.
For several hours.
Normally, this path didn't even take one hour.
Was it because of fatigue?
No one said anything.
A world of only seven sets of footsteps.
An abnormally quiet mountain path.
Even the sounds of insects didn't reach our ears.
Even the air felt cold.
Even though it was summer.
Although it was dark, I could still see.
I could see the path.
I've always had good night vision.
Around the time when I started wondering if I'd taken a wrong turn, we finally arrived at the town.
Humanity had been annihilated.
