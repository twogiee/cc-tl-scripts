"I should get going soon."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Miki]
"Ah, that's right."

As Miki walked away, she turned around.

[Miki]
"Did you know Mimi-sempai said she's reopening the club?"

[Taichi]
"Oooh."

The one with the antenna.
I have to pretend I don't know.

[Taichi]
"That's different from the...not the Active Peace Maintenance......uhhh, from the Active Life Maintenance Club Tomoki's doing?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, it's the Broadcasting Club......you know, like a radio station."
//"On" sounded so out of place.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Yeah......the one using some kind of community FM channel?"
//If you agree with the change before this one then yea, I changed it because didn't make sense anymore.-Spin

[Miki]
"It is."

[Taichi]
"Didn't a lot of stuff happen to cancel it?"

[Miki]
"I think she's been constructing the antenna."

[Taichi]
"Uwa, that's dangerous."

Not just because it'd been left unfinished before.

[Miki]
"She was swaying around on her stepladder."

[Taichi]
"Swaying......"

[Miki]
"It seemed at least that dangerous."

[Taichi]
"......aaah, so it was a joke after all."

[Miki]
"It must be."

We looked at each other and laughed weakly.

[Miki]
"Let's both do our best to live."

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

[Miki]
"I'm cute after all."
[Miki]
"See you."

Miki threw up one hand as she left.

[Taichi]
"Still, the club..."
