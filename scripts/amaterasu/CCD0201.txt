Time flowed on leisurely.
//I believe this is what happens if you get the bad end on any subroute. 〜IX
I spent the remaining time I had left reading books.
I recently realized that I could read things that I couldn't understand before.
//Deleted "'d", redundancy since realiz-ed establishes past tense -Neko
From now on I'll waste a lot of time and obtain tiny things.

//Has to be better word for debt -Neko
I turned the pages.
While inputting the rows of text into my brain, I simply wasted time.
The 『conquest』 was a failure.
Therefore, there was a need to do it over.
The convenient reset only occurs on the weekend.
Passing these days will be a rehearsal for living in my eventual paradise.
I have to instill time-consuming living habits.
I looked out the window.
Though no cicadas cry in this world, there's someone out there somewhere.
I can't feel them, but that's the truth.
Someone is out there somewhere.
That's a blessing.
My heart, healthily and warmly, tightened up just a little bit.
