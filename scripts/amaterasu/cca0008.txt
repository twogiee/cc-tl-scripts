Now that I'd killed some time in the club room, I was on the way back to my classroom.
There was a virgin stooping down in an unpopular corridor.

[Taichi]
"Are you all right, Ojou-san?"

I extended my hand toward her butt.

[Girl]
"Whoa!"

The girl displayed her formidability by standing up in an instant.
Then she shuffled away to gain distance from me.
She can switch to a state of military alertness in no time flat.
Plus, in the moment she jumped up, she had sent an attack in my direction.

[Taichi]
"......you're not half-bad."

[Girl]
"Neither is Sempai."

With one hand I stopped the mop she'd thrown at my face, letting it fall silently to the floor.

[Taichi]
"It feels like we haven't met in a while."

[Girl]
"Yes, it does."

There stood the girl, like a heroine from a famous fantasy novel adapted into a movie.
But relax; that's only the way she looks.

[Taichi]
"Since it's been so long, I seem to have forgotten your name."

[Girl]
"Yaa."

[Taichi]
"So be at ease......"
[Taichi]
"Johnson."

[Girl]
"At least use a girl's name."

Her face told me she'd had enough of foreigners.

[Taichi]
"You've improved, Miki."

[Miki]
"Yes."

Yamanobe Miki stuck out a chest so meager as to invite tears.

[Miki]
"Because my butt is really high."

[Taichi]
"Though I did touch it a little."

[Miki]
"Because I let you."

She's unfazed.

[Taichi]
"But until I've flipped that skirt......"

[Miki]
"You won't flip it. (definitively)"

She's good.
Bluffs won't work on her any more.

[Taichi]
"Very well. This time I shall leave the flower alone."

[Miki]
"Ehe."

She smiled widely.
Uwaa, hug me...

[Taichi]
"What've you been doing? Cleaning for fun?"

[Miki]
"Ah, yes, there seem to be a lot of filthy spots around here."
[Miki]
"And I like to clean."

She was putting her fictional muscles into it.

[Taichi]
"You're doing this spontaneously? That's so cool!"
[Taichi]
"......aah, I get it, I get it, no need to tell everyone, my sweet. You want my autograph, don't you? The autograph of I, Ijuuin Taichi! You've been urging me for it through this display of school piety!"

[Miki]
"......aah, aah......so that's it."
(TL Note: TP)
[Miki]
"Haven't heard that gag in a while..."

She made a truly pained face.
In fact she seems like she's about to cry.
In fact she seems like she's about to cry.
I thought that two times over.
Now don't panic; deal with this calmly.
As an elite young adult candidate who's tasted both the sweets and sours of life!

[Taichi]
"WhWhWhWhWhWhat's wrong, Yamanobe-kun!? If you don't want me to, then I won't think of filling in that blank space on the paper! I'm stating this honestly!"

My voice was shaking.

[Taichi]
"Oh no, she's crying, awawa."

I wiped the corners of her eyes.
She was about to make me cry too.

[Miki]
"Ah, no, it's nothing, yeah."
[Miki]
"Just a bit of youthful fluid leaking from my tear ducts......"

[Taichi]
"What......?"

Youthful fluid?

[Taichi]
"Don't scare me."

I wiped away my cold sweat.

[Taichi]
"Then this time I shall postpone the prince's (my) autograph signing."

[Miki]
"No!"

A scream that could make her throat hoarse.

[Miki]
"I need it! Please do it!"

[Taichi]
"Y-You want it that badly?"

I shrunk back.

[Miki]
"Please do it, please do it."

She repeated 『Please do it』 with a shrill voice.
My lower abdomen was getting hot.
Why is that?
Why is it doing that?
My corpus cavernosum is always ignoring my will and running wild on its own---
Even if I focused my thoughts on fairy tales, the beastliness wouldn't disappear.

[Taichi]
"F, fine, I'll do it."

[Miki]
"Here you go."

Miki fumbled around on her vertical chest, then took out her Matebook.
That's what they call the notebook which also doubles as the school's identification card.
Indeed.
It seems you do not know of the existence of this school's historic 『Matebook』; the #1 popular high-class public bathhouse available behind the train station of this 『City』.
You're given the notebook when you become a member of this society, and you receive a princess stamp each time you make use of it.
(TL Note: TP)
Based on the stamps you collect, they may decide to let you moderately enjoy prizes such as 'W' and 'Triple.'
......the Triple.
What kind of word is that?
Is that Shangri-la?
Is the sun yellow?
An erection has come......
Crap.
If I shift to a forward-leaning position, Miki's going to catch on.
Miki's a virgin, but she's well versed in male biology.
Because I taught her.
She'll notice whether I lean forward or not, but if I remain dignified, I can at least save face.

[Miki]
"......"

Ah, she glanced.
Miki's face is fairly red now.
She says nothing.
She looked out of the window with a slight shyness.
Uwa, that just makes it more embarrassing. Say something.
Please use your words to toy with me.
The insolent yet shameful god of destruction was suppressed.
Perhaps because he has no firsthand experience, he's weak when faced honestly.
Direhara is prohibited.
*Direhara = Taichian for direct sexual harassment. Mostly immature indecency such as exposing genitalia and making a female touch them. Topknot, detonation switch, single-hook fishing, etc. Depending on the situation they may be seen as perverted conduct.
Or I should say, all of those are perfectly inexcusable acts of perversion.

[Taichi]
"You've nearly used up your notebook, Miki. It's falling apart."

[Miki]
"Falling apart."

Miki meaninglessly repeated my words as a form of agreement.
As I flipped through the pages, I found my very large signatures already scribbled in the margins.
This continued over several pages.
It was as if she was collecting my signatures.
Although technically, I was making her collect them.
I found a blank page and wrote in a new signature.

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"Umm, I ended up borrowing your chest padding today only because I wanted to sign it......so don't think I'm doing this to make fun of you."

[Miki]
"And I'm telling you I don't mind."

[Taichi]
"Are you sure?"

I finished my signature.
Miki's face was calm.
She certainly didn't seem to mind.
I skimmed the other pages.

[Miki]
"Aah, I haven't written who I'm dating in there or anything."

[Taichi]
"I see."

I handed back the notebook.
She held it against her chest which was as flat as the bottom of a slipper.

[Miki]
"Do not concern yourself so, for Miki is a virgin!"

[Taichi]
"It's, it's not like that reassures me or anything."

I lost my head and reverted to infancy.

[Miki]
"Yes yes, I understand."
