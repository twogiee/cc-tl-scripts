My hand naturally stretched toward the smiling girl's chest.
I must have penetrated a blind spot, because Miki neither budged nor lost her smile.
*squeeze*
I realized I was holding boobs.
That 'plank' that I thought had nothing on it......had a definite, albeit faint, texture.

[Miki]
"......crap."

Her lips maintained a smile as they tightened.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, my hand unconsciously-"

[Miki]
"No, that was my fault for being careless."

[Taichi]
"Umm, it may not be my place to say this......but there's actually some mass here. That's wonderful!"

[Miki]
"I'm sorry to trouble you, but when might your hand come off me?"

[Taichi]
"Now there's hope for the future."

[Miki]
"Hmmm, should I be happy, or should I be mad? Or do you seriously plan to keep on doing that?"

[Taichi]
"This is too much for words. To think that this small, no, flat chest of yours had become a three-dimensional solid!"

[Miki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

I stopped fondling her for a moment and looked at her face.
Miki was crying.

[Taichi]
"Huh? What?"

I made her cry?
I made her cry?

[Miki]
"......"

Quiet tears.
Without sobbing, they slid down the curves on her cheeks.
These are the kind of tears one has when being moved by the beauty of an artistic masterpiece.
These shouldn't be the tears which flow from sexual harassment.
I hesitated.
Then stopped.
Because I can't understand.

[Taichi]
"......umm......"

Miki eventually wiped her tears.
Her arms ran back and forth over her eyebrows, and when they were finished they left behind her normal smile.

[Miki]
"Nihehe."
[Miki]
"Now, cleaning, cleaning!"
[Miki]
"But first......seya!!"

[Taichi]
"Guoo!!"

She hit the secret spot on my arm (near the elbow) with one punch.

[Taichi]
"Owww, my muscles hurt like hell!! If I try to make a tight fist I get painful jolts down my nerves!!"

I'm in pain.

[Miki]
"Sweep, sweepâ™ª"

Miki is cleaning.
Wait.

[Taichi]
"......you are Miki, right?"

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"No, never mind."

[Miki]
"Does that statement mean you thought I wasn't Miki because I wasn't flat?"

I spat fictional saliva at her.

[Taichi]
"To be honest, I'm disillusioned."

[Miki]
"Wooow."

[Taichi]
"How many hardcore fans have you just lost?"

[Miki]
"Hardcore fans?"

[Taichi]
"I mean, it's not impossible that you were receiving support from certain unsociable persons that kindergarten is meant to protect kids from, not just because you're a loli but also because you were flat."

[Miki]
"The world is done for."
(TL Note: A "loli" is any young, cute girl.)

[Taichi]
"Miki, you idiot! I'm sorry for sexually harassing you!"
(TL Note: The term "loli" comes from the novel "Lolita," in which a man has sexual relations with an underage girl, so the term is now the basis of much pedophilia-related Japanese slang.))

I managed to slander and apologize at the same time, after which I ran away.
