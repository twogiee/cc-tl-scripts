I thought I'd try going to school, so I left the house.
Youko-chan was there.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Youko]
"......good...morning."

She was a little frightened.
//For some reason those two words while in that sentence made it sound really...not weird but there's another word I can't think of...Also, I changed it to "frightened" which sounds better if you leave it this way.-Spin
......maybe I teased her too much.

[Taichi]
"I won't do anything in the midst of this extraordinary situation."

I gestured for her to come over.
A smile.

[Taichi]
"Don't stay over there, come over here."

Youko-chan was reassured a little, and came closer.
I pinched her cheek.

[Youko]
"............"

I'd reflexively done something disagreeable.
But as expected, her expression hadn't changed.
Her poker face seemed almost fed up, maybe because it had no heart in it.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Youko]
"......liar."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

She's right.

[Taichi]
"Because I'm arabesque."

[Youko]
"......I think you wanted to say picaresque."
//No idea whether either or neither of these words needs tl notes. You can wiki both easily. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"............"

*pinch*

[Youko]
"Ow."

She felt pain without changing her expression.

[Taichi]
"I can't forgive myself for making such a simple mistake."

[Youko]
"Then you should be harassing yourself......ah, that hurts, a lot......"

She wasn't acting like it hurt.

[Taichi]
"So, what's wrong?"
[Taichi]
"It's rare for you to show yourself in the daytime like this. I thought you lived hidden away in the darkness."

[Youko]
"This."

A paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Women's underwear?"

[Youko]
"Do you need them?"
//Since "Women's" is plural, "it" shouldn't be there. Wonder how Sheeta missed it.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Well......do I?"

The human I am is too impulsive.

[Youko]
"You've got plenty in the dresser drawers in your house."

[Taichi]
"No, since they aren't freshly stripped......"

[Youko]
"......I understand."

She took hers off.

[Taichi]
"It's okay! I don't need it!"

[Youko]
"......nn."

[Taichi]
"If you just yank it off like that, it'll be sold at auction with an attached picture."

[Youko]
"......I might not like that."

[Taichi]
"You might have to indulge in masturbation with four pairs of shorts on your head until you have bracelets of soiled underwear on both wrists."
//I'm not all that confident about this tl as he used some rather strange and out of place verbs, but I'm thinking it probably won't matter. 〜IX

[Youko]
"I wouldn't mind that."

Are you sure?
She said it like it was nothing.

[Taichi]
"Come on now......aren't you a third-year high schooler? Pull yourself together. "

[Youko]
"I am."

[Taichi]
"No you aren't. You're missing something."

[Youko]
"......unexpected."
[Youko]
"Taichi's losing it."

[Taichi]
"This is the age when I want to do that. Puberty and all."

Then, I confirmed the contents of the paper bag.

[Taichi]
"......sandwiches?"
//I was so focused on not putting in the extra h again that I almost missed the d this time. Truly sad. 〜IX

There were a lot of them.

[Youko]
"This is what's left over from the raw foods that could still be preserved."

[Taichi]
"You made them."
[Taichi]
"......that's right, without people, fruits and vegetables are just-"

[Youko]
"For the time being. I only surveyed some fields and greenhouses......it should be enough for two people to live on......"

[Taichi]
"There are eight."

I spoke with a raised finger.

[Taichi]
"That's not a good way to think. Your humanity will break."
[Taichi]
"Didn't we decide to preserve life?"

[Youko]
"......yes."

She nods honestly, but...
In the end she'll only mechanically carry out what I say.
It provoked me quite a bit.

[Taichi]
"Thank you. I'll take these. There might be a bit too much though."

[Youko]
"............"

I had a feeling that her facial muscles moved (under my fingers).

[Taichi]
"So much, it's like a double portion."

[Youko]
"............"

I had a feeling that her facial muscles moved (under my fingers).
If I'm not touching her, I can hardly read any of her subtle changes in expression.

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"So much, it's like a double portion."

I tried saying it again.

[Youko]
"............"

I had a feeling that her facial muscles moved (under my fingers).
Ha-haaan.
A vicious thought.

[Taichi]
"This double portion of sandwiches......I will surely......"
