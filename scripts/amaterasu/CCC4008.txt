As I was waiting,

[Miki]
"Sempaaai!"

Miki came to me, dragging Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Yo."

[Miki]
"Did you wait?"

[Taichi]
"I was just about to come here!"

There we were exchanging stylish gags instead of greetings.

[Miki]
"Weeell, I'm sorry it took so long to persuade her."

[Kiri]
"......persuasion?......You call that persuasion!?"

Kiri had a great deal of grievances.

[Miki]
"Unmanageable lust."

She muttered.

[Kiri]
"............"

She became quiet.
What sort of secret does Kiri have?

[Taichi]
"Then where shall we go?"

[Miki]
"Mountaaain!"

[Taichi]
"......mountain?"

[Miki]
"A three-person date looking over the town from atop the mountain!"

[Taichi]
"Sounds tiring. I'm fine with that."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin's fine too, riiight?"

[Kiri]
"......whether I am or not, I can't disobey."

[Miki]
"Then GO!"

Miki wrapped her arm around Kiri's.

[Miki]
"Come on, come on, grab an arm."

[Taichi]
"Ah, aaah......"

So, I wrapped my arm around Kiri's other.

[Kiri]
"......okay, okay."

The three of us walked awkwardly.
Uneven paces.
A puzzling atmosphere.
With slipping morale.
It was quite like us.

[Taichi]
"Wait, wait, aren't I supposed to be in the middle?"

[Miki]
"This is just fiiine."

I made eye contact with Kiri.
Hmph.
She averted hers.

[Taichi]
"......well, whatever."

The three of us walked.
It was a bit cumbersome, but we did our best.

[Miki]
"If we don't hurry, the sun will set."

[Taichi]
"Hurry?"

[Miki]
"Hurry up! Hurry up!"
