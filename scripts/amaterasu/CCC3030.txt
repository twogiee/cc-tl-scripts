And then, Sunday.
Clear weather.
An unknown domain not in the diaries.
I don't know how the world will end today.
One week......it was short.
It turned into days solely for capturing Kiri.
Even so,
Being able to reestablish the club was a great fortune.
If the following me looks at the notebooks, they should become hints for how to reestablish it again.
I wished to have this happy time over and over somehow.
Within this miniature garden that cannot be saved.

[Taichi]
"No one's here yet."

I looked around.
The wide roof had a folding tent and various equipment.
The antenna stood lightheartedly.
A blue sky without a single EM wave flying across.

[Kiri]
"......it's blue."

Kiri looked up at the sky.

[Taichi]
"Not a single cloud."

[Kiri]
"Yes."

But something about Kiri's facial features still made me think of cloudy weather.
The two of us clung to the fence.
We lined up with no conversation.
At long last,

[Misato]
"Good morning."

Everyone came.

[Tomoki]
"......okay."

Mimi-sempai definitely didn't talk to him, but Tomoki came.

[Taichi]
"Thanks......when shall we start?"

[Misato]
"Ummm, it hasn't been decided, so right now is fine."

[Sakuraba]
"DJ."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, a DJ......someone who could..."

No one raised their hand.

[Taichi]
"Mimi-sempai?"

[Misato]
"Eh!? Me? I can't, no, no, impossible, I'll bite my tongue!"

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"......hoyo?"

She was in the midst of tearing off a piece of beef jerky.
Not beautiful.
......she's out.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"Fine by me, but how much do I get?"

[Taichi]
"............"

This isn't a matter of money.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba......"

[Sakuraba]
"Do you think I have ever been able to speak logically and consistently?"

[Taichi]
"......you understand this awfully well."
[Taichi]
"Then......Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"......eh!?"

Her complexion changed.
She was sweating in an instant.

[Taichi]
"DJ."

[Kiri]
"Ah! I can't! Impossible, I can't talk in front of people!"

[Taichi]
"Whaaat? They're all destroyed anyway, so it's fine."

[Tomoki]
"What happened to our hope!?"

[Taichi]
"Gefu!"

I was chopped.

[Kiri]
"That's bad! I can't, impossible, I......I'll say something strange!"

She was seized with fear and rolled up.

[Taichi]
"I'd like to see a strange Kiri-chin."

I pulled her hand.

[Kiri]
"You caaaan't!!"

I pulled her hip.

[Taichi]
"......I can see your panties."

[Kiri]
"!!?"

She hurriedly pushed down her skirt.
Kiri broke her posture.
I pulled her harder.

[Taichi]
"Congratulations on your debut as a DJ."

[Kiri]
"Save meeee!!"

You can't do it?
I released her.
Kiri quickly hid behind Miki.
Damn your small animal mentality.

[Taichi]
"I get it......I guess I'll do it."

There was no one but me.

[Tomoki]
"You can start whenever."

What should I talk about?
I can't think of anything.
A meaningless SOS.
But no one is thinking that.
My own body...moved on its own...with others' sensations.
I sat down in the chair and gripped the mike.
I was automatic.
I think I was always something like automatic.
Surroundings and contacts created the form of the current me.

[Taichi]
"Ummm......are there any living people listening to this broadcast?"
[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club."
[Taichi]
"Is anyone alive out there?"
[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club. There are eight of us alive."
[Taichi]
"Eight of us are alive."

Aren't people precious?
Aren't family and friends precious?
As long as I'm a person,

[Taichi]
"......everyone is in excellent health."

If I'm fine not being a person, I could live in solitude.
But I'm better off as a human.
I wanted to become a monster, not of instincts, but of rationality.
Even though I should have been able to become a more perfectly harmless being that way.
There wasn't enough.
Of contact. Of touching one another.

[Taichi]
"Ummm......"

Our families...
......are gone.
Friendships with people as shallow as air in the paradise of the miniature garden.
......I'm forgetting even their faces.
Meeting Youko-chan.
......she doesn't see me as a stranger.
The Shinkawas.
......I was taught that humans are enemies.
During my childhood, my most sentimental time, I was unable to touch people.

[Taichi]
"A long time ago, I committed a sin."

The wind chime rang.
Six gazes gathered.

[Taichi]
"I made a friend of mine die."

[Sakuraba]
"......Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"I didn't directly lay hands on him, but......I effectively made him die."
[Taichi]
"That friend was one of many humans who'd hurt me an even longer time ago."
[Taichi]
"He lost his memory, and appeared once again before me."
[Taichi]
"He behaved as if his sin had disappeared along with his memory."
[Taichi]
"At first I didn't notice either. After all, it had occurred years earlier."

The atmosphere changed.
The doubt and unease of six humans swirled.
It will probably calm down soon.
Though it might turn into a harsh atmosphere.

[Taichi]
"But at some point, I began to notice."
[Taichi]
"Actually, the wound I received from him shouldn't have even been that big of a deal to me."
[Taichi]
"Unworthy Kurosu Taichi, aiming to be a young adult who has tasted both the sweets and sours of life."
[Taichi]
"But,"

Kiri moved.
She touched her hand to her mouth.

[Taichi]
"But I...I became unable to see him as a friend."

[Kiri]
"......uu......"

[Miki]
"Kiri......?"

[Taichi]
"I ended up seeing him like a 'thing.'"
[Taichi]
"I think it was different from an emotional argument like, 'I can't forgive him.'"
[Taichi]
"Inside me, it's certain that his value changed."
[Taichi]
"No......it didn't just change......he became worthless."
[Taichi]
"I lost interest in him."
[Taichi]
"When he regained his memory, he said, 'please forgive me.'"
[Taichi]
"Just maybe......if he hadn't asked that of me, the result might have been different."

[Kiri]
"......!"

[Taichi]
"After all, no matter what one does, one cannot falsify the past."
[Taichi]
"I think one can only accept the person's sin, or see them as an enemy."
[Taichi]
"......his actual sin......wasn't really that big of a deal."
[Taichi]
"I should have just poured out the usual jokes and stayed with him as a friend."

[Kiri]
"......Sem...pai......"

Tears.
Tears?
That's yet another thing I don't have.

[Taichi]
"Why wasn't I able to say, 'Don't mention it,' back then?......I think about it a lot."
[Taichi]
"......that's because I...am twisted."
[Taichi]
"Because I have a twisted heart."
[Taichi]
"I don't have enough rationality."
[Taichi]
"But in order to foster rationality, another person is needed."
[Taichi]
"I don't think it's something that can be raised without quarreling."
[Taichi]
"But the friend I had for quarreling with...I hurt him, until he was gone."
[Taichi]
"......that was......my dilemma."

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Sakuraba]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Even if memories go away, what happened in the past won't disappear."
[Taichi]
"But even though I got hurt, and even though I was hurt by others,"
[Taichi]
"......we should have remained as two people who could face each other."

[Kiri]
"Uu!......ku......"

Sobbing.

[Misato]
"......Sakura-san."

Everyone here's aware, right?
About what happened between Yutaka and I?
No one spoke up.
No one stopped me.

[Taichi]
"......I became afraid."
[Taichi]
"But I couldn't commit suicide. I couldn't end it myself."
[Taichi]
"There were times I thought that all people should just go away."
[Taichi]
"When I hurt others, that's what I thought."
[Taichi]
"Since people have left the world......it's been a week."
[Taichi]
"There were times I wondered whether it was my fault somehow."

[Misato]
"......"

[Miki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I'm no good, after all."
[Taichi]
"It's not that I don't hold something that could be called thanks for all the friends who've hung out with me despite that."

[Sakuraba]
"Do you or don't you?"

A rare counter by Sakuraba.

[Tomoki]
"Double negative."

A mechanical counter by Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"......I'm fine doing things for myself."
[Taichi]
"I don't mind caring about people for my own sake."
[Taichi]
"So that tomorrow......I can become just a little bit better."
[Taichi]
"I still have friends."
[Taichi]
"To build up a relationship is also to cover the heart in wounds."
[Taichi]
"It's a painful thing, not beautiful at all."
[Taichi]
"I thought that people needed other people."
[Taichi]
"That is why...I believe there are still people somewhere listening to this broadcast."
[Taichi]
"Our address is---"

I explained the process for contacting us wirelessly.
This should do it.
I wonder, did I speak until I was empty?
......well, that's what this is.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club. There are eight of us alive."
[Taichi]
"See you next week."

I finished.
I took a deep breath.
Applause.
First Mimi-sempai. Then all the others followed.

[Taichi]
"......"

I didn't feel like making a joke.
I was enveloped in embarrassment.
I scratched my cheek in order to endure that sweet torture.

[Misato]
"There, you did great."

[Taichi]
"......haa."

[Sakuraba]
"Is there a next week?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, well......it seemed appropriate."

[Tomoki]
"Do the small things really matter?"

[Sakuraba]
"......indeed."

[Miki]
"That was so cool!"

She was clicking a disposable camera.

[Taichi]
"......stop that!"

[Miki]
"You're embarrassed, you're embarrassed."

[Taichi]
"Shuuut iiit!"

And then,

[Kiri]
"......Sempai."

Kiri stood up.
What's she going to say?
I waited with tension.

[Kiri]
"Y-"

Y.

[Kiri]
"You......did a great job."

She lowered her head.

[Taichi]
"............"

Deep emotion boiled up.
I can't put it into words.
Incomprehensible, yet reassuring. That sort of sensation.
I had a feeling that the water level rose in my heart.
A very small amount.

[Taichi]
"......thank you."

The sky whitened for a moment.

[Taichi]
"......!"

Aaah, this timing---
I quickly became afraid.
But I mustn't become confused.
I embraced Kiri.
I fell to my knees and buried my face in her stomach.

[Kiri]
"Kya! Wh-what's wrong!?"

[Miki]
"Owa, such boldness......"

[Misato]
"Im-impure sexual suspension......"

[Sakuraba]
"Those are novel words, President-sempai."

[Tomoki]
"......Taichi really is perverted."

[Taichi]
"Aren't I depressed!? Please, comfort me!"

I'm frightened.
I'm frightened of disappearing.
Saturday night was the last save point.
The joy and confession and very small emotional growth I had today will all be in vain.
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

[Kiri]
"......Sempai......you're crying?"

A ringing in my ears.
At the edges of my pupils, buried in her chest, the world was whitening.
Whitening---

[Taichi]
"......dammit."

That was my dying word.
