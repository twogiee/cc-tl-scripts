So, I've come to the roof, but,
What should I do?
Ah, it's Sempai.

[Misato]
"Parararararara!"

She's practicing for a survival game.
Sempai holding an SMG at the hip is a wonderful sight.
By the way, these small arms of ours have been used every year at the campouts.
Campouts ought to have survival games.
We even brought BB guns with electric firing mechanisms too.

[Taichi]
"Hello."

[Misato]
"Eh!?"

She turned toward me.
Her SMG gushed water.

[Taichi]
"Wappu!"

A direct hit between the eyes.
As an electric water gun, it was quite strong.

[Misato]
"Ah! I'm sorry......"

[Taichi]
"No, summer survival games are limited to water guns."

[Misato]
"Come to think of it, a new model came out before the annihilation."

[Taichi]
"That's cold......"
[Taichi]
"Ummm, now that you mention it, it's been bugging me, but..."

[Misato]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Is it okay to leave the antenna alone?"

[Misato]
"............th-that's right."

[Taichi]
"So you got swept up by Miki's pace."

[Misato]
"She attacked me and I returned fire......"

Then---

[Miki]
"GI die!"

She war cried.

[Taichi]
"We're not GIs!"

I returned fire. So did Sempai.
Our water guns gushed fire.
*water guns gushing fire = don't worry about it.

[Taichi]
"Do you have a Vietnam Complex!?"

[Miki]
"GI diiie!!!"

[Taichi]
"Don't call me a GI!"

[Kiri]
"Dieee!"

[Taichi]
"Owa!"

Damn, somehow I'm half serious.

[Taichi]
"Damn Vietnam-conscious monkeys......you're the ones who'll die!"

I didn't know the true meaning of Vietcon!

[Kiri]
"Ku! Impudent......"
(TL Note: In Japanese, "Vietcon (Vietnam complex)" and "Viet Cong" sound identical.)

[Taichi]
"You...!"

The water guns' lines of fire crossed over.
*water guns' lines of fire crossing = don't worry about it.

[Misato]
"Suspension, suspension!!"

[Miki]
"Uryaaa!"

Club activities again......
I thought that, but I couldn't ignore the enemy before my eyes.

[Taichi]
"Ku! Out of bullets (water)!?"

I started reloading the gunpowder in the tank attached to my hip.
This takes ten seconds.

[Kiri]
"......hu!"

Kiri smiled wickedly.
The accurate shots increased.
I lowered my body and ran.
I won't be hit that easily.
But ten seconds is a long time.
Kiri closed in to make certain of hitting me.
At the exact moment I finished reloading.
I shot.

[Kiri]
"......ah!!?"

Kiri rolled to one side. That's more like it!
One more shot.
This one missed too, but Kiri's posture broke further.
She fell forward and clung to the fence.
The fence leaned.
Kiri had placed her full body weight on it, so she rolled over to the other side of the fence as it broke and curled.

[Taichi]
"Kiri!"

I rushed over to her.
Will I make it in time?
Impossible, not at this distance.
I knew that.

[Kiri]
"Ah......eh......?"

The metal fittings on her uniform made clacking noises.
I heard it as she rubbed against the mesh of the fence.
Sounds from the midst of her slipping down.
Right before my eyes, Kiri is...
Miki is...

[Taichi]
"-!?"

You could say it was swift.
Miki extended her hand. She grabbed Kiri's wrist.
By the breadth of a hair, Kiri's fall had been avoided.

[Miki]
"......Kiri."

Her other arm, holding onto the fence, had been torn by the wire and was hemorrhaging.
Kiri herself was still agape.
........................
Miki pulled her up.
She remained in a daze for a while.

[Miki]
"Owowowowww..."

Horrible hemorrhaging.

[Taichi]
"This is...we need to go to the health room...... Sempai, please bring back some first aid equipment from there."

[Misato]
"Okay."

[Miki]
"Ah, I'll go to the health room with Sempai!"

[Misato]
"Eh......you can't, I'm not really......Peke-kun, please!"

[Taichi]
"Whoooa."

[Miki]
"Ah, I might be able to go myself."

[Taichi]
"I can't dress her wound."

[Miki]
"Aaaau."

Blood is a weakness of mine too.

[Taichi]
"W-well, you can do it."

[Miki]
"............"

Beautiful blood.
She saved her friend.
My heart didn't ache.
In this case, it might be okay.
When we entered the building, I saw Kiri curled up.
Her terror was belated. It always had been.
