When I woke up, Miki was in my arms.

[Miki]
"Fuwa......"

Our eyes met.

[Miki]
"......kya!?"

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Miki]
"Eh, huh? Where am...?"

Is she getting disturbed?

[Taichi]
"Didn't we just do something erotic?"

[Miki]
"Ah, that's right......right, right."

She stuck out her tongue.

[Taichi]
"You really......"

[Miki]
"*sob*......buuut, I can't imagine that as anything other than normal sexual harassment."

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

[Miki]
"Aaah, I'm not a virgin anymore."

[Taichi]
"Yep. You're an excellent beech now."

[Miki]
"Gabu."

My nose was bitten.

[Taichi]
"Owww!!"

[Miki]
"And now a kiss!"

She jumped onto me.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

She embraced me head on and kissed me.

[Miki]
"Nnn......nnn......nnnnn......"

A morning saliva exchange.
......now I'm hard.

[Miki]
"Uu......this...stiffness?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

[Miki]
"......wanna do it?"

[Taichi]
"I want to, but......are we okay for time?"

[Miki]
"Aaah......"
[Miki]
"Then, kissing instead!"

Do girls like kissing?

[Miki]
"Nnn."

I have my alarm clock set for ten AM on Sundays, but...
I spent nearly an hour kissing Miki.

[Miki]
"Chooon."

There was Miki punctually wearing her uniform.

[Miki]
"I feel so refreshed."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Miki]
"Taichi-kun is also feeling refreshed."

[Taichi]
"Yeaaah."

We both entered the bathwater.
Though it was precious overnight water, today is the end anyway so it doesn't matter.

[Miki]
"......what are you doing?"
(TL Note: If water is allowed to sit in certain filters overnight (including sand), it can be made sanitary without boiling.)

[Taichi]
"There."

[Miki]
"Aaah, a bottle suddenly popped up!"
[Miki]
"Eh? How?"

[Taichi]
"When you were getting in, I chilled this in the mini-fridge on high power."

[Miki]
"It's a Ramune with the marble inside."

[Taichi]
"Eighty yen at the Tasaki Shop."
(TL Note: Ramune is a Japanese soft drink brand famous for the unique bottle design with a marble inside a narrowed portion of the bottle neck.)

[Miki]
"Pretty..."
(TL Note: The marble seals in the carbonation until pushed down with a special device included with the drink, then it rattles around while one drinks.))

[Taichi]
"You can see the world sparkling beautifully through the marble."

[Miki]
"It's like summer."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

We drank the Ramune together.

[Miki]
"It's gotten beautiful, and the Ramune was great, so I think I'll be going soon."

[Taichi]
"I was thinking I'd go to club."

[Miki]
"......you're really going to go to the club?"

[Taichi]
"All the preparations are made."
[Taichi]
"Even that broken antenna might reach somewhere."

[Miki]
"Umm..."
[Miki]
"Won't you live in the same time with me?"

Eyes asking me,
Seriously.

[Taichi]
"......I appreciate the offer, but..."

[Miki]
"Are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"I want to forget. The aftertaste is pretty bad."

[Miki]
"......I've been watching Sempai every week."
[Miki]
"Not all the Sempais are the same person, you know?"

[Taichi]
"That's true."

[Miki]
"The you and me living and talking here now will only happen once."

[Taichi]
"But Miki, you're forgetting."
[Taichi]
"My rationality is an incredibly easy thing to break."

[Miki]
"Ah......"

[Taichi]
"If we're together forever, Miki will be in danger."
[Taichi]
"Because Miki's so cute, I might put more force into it."

I rubbed her head.

[Miki]
"......this won't go anywhere."

[Taichi]
"That's how it works."
[Taichi]
"Well, if you ever want someone to spoil you, please ask the other Kurosu Taichis anytime."

[Miki]
"............"

There was no answer.

[Taichi]
"Now, are we going?"
