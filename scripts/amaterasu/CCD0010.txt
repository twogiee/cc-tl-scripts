"Ho......"

I tried moving around in various ways.
Sunday's club activities.
So that, on the world's final day, everyone can join together.
However......I felt hardship.
To make everyone fornicate......I mean, to make everyone reconcile, puzzle pieces were currently needed.
I headed back to the hokora.
(TL Note: Kanji homonyms again.)
A large quantity of notebooks.
More than I could finish reading.
Since I violated Miki (or so it appeared), Kiri's going to become worthless.
It's good to increase information.
But by increasing it too much, I'll lose the time to analyze it.
It's a dilemma.
I continued thinking about it deep into the night.

"Taichi."

A light shone on me from behind.
A flashlight.
Youko-chan.

[Taichi]
"Nna......too bright......"

[Youko]
"Even your eyes will go bad if you read in the dark too much."

/she's talking about this, not just normal reading.

[Taichi]
"Nn......sorry."

[Youko]
"Did you discover anything?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing. I seem to be stuck thinking in circles."

[Youko]
"I see. That's a shame."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan, would you......"

I began to ask, then shut my mouth.
Was I really going to rely on her?

[Taichi]
"Never mind. I'll go home."

I stood up.
I put the notebooks back in the hokora.
I took several with me to read.

[Youko]
"......can we go home together?"

[Taichi]
"You're always watching me anyway."

[Youko]
"I'm sorry......"
