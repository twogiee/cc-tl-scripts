The health room.
This place needs a large-breasted nurse with glasses (who often uses a male voice).
A health room without a large-breasted nurse with glasses is like a medium tuna sushi with nothing inside.
But of course I can't expect a large-breasted nurse with glasses to be here right now.
Instead, Youko-chan was here.

[Taichi]
"Put on a white coat and glasses."

[Youko]
"......okay."

She disappeared behind the beds.
She returned with glasses.
She'd procured them far too quickly.
And why from the bed......?
Then, the nurse's locker.
There was a white coat inside.
She returned.
Order received and paid in full.
The time required was under ten seconds.

[Youko]
"......will this do?"

[Taichi]
"Better than Templeton Pek."

[Youko]
"I see."

I can't fail to acknowledge it.
Her bust was, well, pretty good.
Youko-chan as a nurse.
Youko-sensei: 『Strip so that I can examine you.』
Youko-sensei: 『The bottom too,』
Youko-sensei: 『Since I'm examining your fertility.』
Youko-sensei: 『......no good. It won't stay still when I touch it.』
Youko-sensei: 『......yes......stay still......good boy......』

[Taichi]
"Uu, uuu......"

Isn't that pretty good?

[Youko]
"I just saw Taichi having an indecent delusion about me."

[Taichi]
"......"

A sense of defeat.
This is because of how long she's known me.

[Taichi]
"That's enough cosplay."

[Youko]
"You were making me cosplay......"

She whispered alone.
She returned to her normal self.
Again she went to the bed to return the glasses.

[Taichi]
"So, why here?"

[Youko]
"......Miyasumi was hurt."

I peeked around the bed.

[Taichi]
"Mimi-sempai?"

[Youko]
"She's already sleeping."

[Taichi]
"......the bandaging?"

[Youko]
"I did it."

She gazed at me.

[Taichi]
"That's rare......you spontaneously doing something for others."

[Youko]
"If I didn't......I thought Taichi would harass me......"

[Taichi]
"I see."

That's true.
I pinched her cheeks with both hands.

[Taichi]
"But I'll harass you anyway."

[Youko]
"......that's true."

Her clear-cut face collapsed like clay.

[Youko]
"Stop."

But she didn't seriously resist.
She doesn't know how to resist.
Because fundamentally, that would either mean eliminating me or ignoring me.

[Taichi]
"Uriuri."

[Youko]
"Uuu, uuuu......"

[Taichi]
"Your cheeks are soooft."

[Youko]
"......that hurts......that hurts a lot......"

[Taichi]
"That's your fault for having cheeks."

[Youko]
"What you say is unreasonable."

I quickly got bored.

[Taichi]
"So, how are Sempai's wounds?"

[Youko]
"Light abrasions and bruises. There is no threat to her life."

She said without any concern for her reddening cheeks.

[Taichi]
"I see."

I could see her breathing softly.
She didn't seem to be in any pain.

[Taichi]
"She's sleeping well."

I parted the hair on her forehead.

[Misato]
"Nnnnn..."

She purred.
Moe...
Next, I stretched my hand to a different place.
*grab!*

[Taichi]
"Nuu!"

Youko-chan was gripping my wrist.
The grip strength of an adult male!

[Taichi]
"......what are you doing?"

[Youko]
"Just now, Taichi was trying to touch her breasts."

[Taichi]
"No, nooo."

[Youko]
"I think switching to English is suspicious......"
[Youko]
"English being a weakness of Taichi's is an important part of that judgment."

[Taichi]
"Ku! You've researched me so well......"

Just as I thought, the world is necessarily a metagame.

[Youko]
"As long as my eyes are black, I won't let you touch those breasts."

[Taichi]
"Damn you!"

But I had no chance of winning in close quarters.

[Taichi]
"In this situation......I'll fondle your chest!"

One of my hands was sent out toward her chest.

[Youko]
"......I thought you'd do that."

Youko-chan's pupils filled with invincible confidence.
She knew!?
But even if it was a trap,

[Taichi]
"I'll fondle right through it!"

My left hand bit down on her breast.
She showed no defensive or evasive motions.
So it was a trap.

[Youko]
"It worked......"

[Taichi]
"What!?"

[Youko]
"A confused Taichi will attack me since I'm right in front of him......that's what I predicted."

[Taichi]
"This sensation...it can't be!?"

[Youko]
"Yes......no bra."

[Taichi]
"Ah! Aaaaah! Whaaat!?"

Soft.
Through her uniform, an unimaginably soft sensation!

[Taichi]
"Ah! Aaaaah!"

I was losing wisdom.

[Taichi]
"Oh, my Sophia (wisdom) is......"

By touching the soft and tensile breasts, my wisdom was disintegrating!
(TL Note: The name "Sophia" is derived from the Greek word "Sophia" meaning "wisdom".)
The greater the mass of those breasts, the more the disintegration speed increased.

[Taichi]
"Ku! What......breasts......it's as if my head is completely worsening."

I noticed that I was fondling with both hands.

[Youko]
"......nn!......"

A hot, hoarse voice.
It entered my ears and vaporized my rationality.
Up, down, left, right, four ways,
Eight ways, East, West, South, North.
I continued fondling the breasts with degrees of freedom similar to that of an analog video game controller.

[Youko]
"Tai......chi, nn!......"

[Taichi]
"Ku, what a sophisticated bust this is......"

[Youko]
"That makes no sense......ah......"

Aaaaaaah.
I'm being tempted...
I'm being completely tempted.

[Misato]
"Fuwaaa..."

Sempai woke up.

[Misato]
"......no......I slept with my glasses...... on......"

Her eyes fell on our foolish state.

[Misato]
"Seyaaa!"

Her hand-slash-sword swung down.
Cutting apart the nipple and fingertips.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun!"

[Taichi]
"Y-yes!?"

[Misato]
"What you were doing is a yellow suspension!"

She grabbed my fingers.
Is there a red suspension......?

[Taichi]
"B-but this girl has sophisticated boobs!"

[Misato]
"Urbanely refined boobs aren't a good enough reason!"

With a courageous motion, as if meaning to cut off my neck, she mowed down my arms.

[Misato]
"It's been a while, Hasekura-san."

[Youko]
"......nn."

[Misato]
"It really......owowowow."

[Taichi]
"Are you okay?"

[Misato]
"Yeah, some of the building materials collapsed......"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan saved you."

[Misato]
"Well......Hasekura-san did?"

[Youko]
"I'm not the one who saved her."

[Taichi]
"Then who?"

[Youko]
"......Shima Tomoki."

[Taichi]
"Tomoki did?"

Ah-hah, so that's why he just......

[Taichi]
"Sempai, he gets embarrassed easily, so......"

Mimi-sempai looked at me blankly.

[Taichi]
"......hello?"

[Misato]
"Tomoki......saved me......?"

She looked confused and upset.
When was it...
That those two stopped talking to one another?
Tomoki in the club room.
Sempai in the broadcast room.
It became rare for them to mutually occupy the same space.
Anyone who saw it would understand.
And for only that reason, it remained concealed.
Our discord existed between everyone.
I realized that Youko-chan had disappeared.
