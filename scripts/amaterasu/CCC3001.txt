It was early summer last year,
When I met Shinkawa Yutaka.
A summer of noisy cicadas.
We bumped into one another coincidentally.
And strangely, a conversation sprung up.
We just clicked.
There were those in Gunjou who lived completely in their own world.
There were those who hurt others easily.
At some point, the world began giving birth to lunatics.
Many of them hurt people.
Sicknesses of the heart were no longer just one's own problem.
The source was unknown.
The government threw out a number of countermeasures to tackle it, but those weren't widely reported on.
Youko-chan said that they were moving in secret.
Details unknown.
At the very least, the world was being soaked in a lax insanity......I understood that fact very well when I asked my own heart.
//I could've sworn I used "lax insanity" a long, long time ago, but I can't find anything with text searches. Anyone else recognize that? 〜IX
That's why Gunjou Institute existed.
As an isolated facility.
Someone being held back a year was a daily occurrence.
But those who don't recover after several years get sent to yet another facility.
Those people hardly need any contact with others.
They're lacking in the strength to live independently, but their hearts are already separated from those of other people.
That's why,
It's a little hard to make friends in Gunjou.
Because it's hard to materialize a conversation.
In one class, I'd guess there are about ten people.
That you could have a real conversation with.

[Shinkawa]
『Okay, I get the feeling this'll work somehow.』

[Taichi]
"............"

I wonder who was wrong.
Was it me?
Or was it him?
I couldn't produce a conclusion.
Nor could I produce any tears.
I can't...not yet.
