The door wouldn't open.
I pushed hard, but there was turbulence before me.
A pathway of wind.
My ears rang.
And, Sempai.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"Oh, good morning."

[Taichi]
"How's the antenna?"

[Misato]
"I guess it's getting pretty close."

[Taichi]
"The plan was to use this on Sunday, right?"

[Misato]
"......you remember well."

[Taichi]
"That much at least."

[Misato]
"That's right. If nothing had happened, we were......"
[Misato]
"But, since all people are gone, it can't be helped......ah, I'm sorry."

[Taichi]
"It's nothing."

There's really no need to apologize.
I'm not even hurt.

[Taichi]
"Well, because of that, going to the roof became prohibited."

[Misato]
"......though you all seem to come here pretty often anyway."

[Taichi]
"On that note, so is Sempai right now."

Two faces exchanging glances. Our cheeks relaxed at the same time.

[Misato]
"Then we're both suspended. Yellow suspension."

[Taichi]
"That's harsh."
[Taichi]
"......Sempai, did you...do all this on your own?"

[Misato]
"I had some sketches, so I managed."
[Misato]
"But, it was tough. At one time it was falling apart."

Even so, Sempai didn't desire help from anyone.
Exposing her body to the merciless sunlight, she'd been continuing club activities by herself.

[Taichi]
"......if I asked to help now, that'd be pretty selfish, wouldn't it?"

Sempai's happy face broke.

[Misato]
"Thank you."
[Misato]
"It's the thought that counts."

Well, that's what this is.

[Taichi]
"You could have used me any time, you know."

Please use me for your flight.

[Misato]
"Ah, that's okay, that's okay, I'm just fine."
[Misato]
"In place of that, let's have some tea together sometime."

[Taichi]
"Okay."
