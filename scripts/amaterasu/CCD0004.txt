I bumped into a girl on the hill.

[Nanaka]
"Kya......owowowww......watch where you're walking, you bungler!"

[Taichi]
"Ku......what? Isn't it your fault for looking off to one side!?"

[Nanaka]
"I've loved you since the first time we bumped into each other!"

She embraced me.

[Taichi]
"Haee? Way too fast!"

I've never seen such high speed hormones.

[Taichi]
"......who have I bumped into?"

[Nanaka]
"Nanaka."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka......yeah, good name."

[Nanaka]
"Thanks."
//Again huh. I can understand this one though since she says it differently with the voice.-Spin
[Nanaka]
"Well, as to what I am exactly, you'll have to wait for the continuing investigation."

[Taichi]
"You're not a ghost?"

[Nanaka]
"Aaah, I think I'm not."

[Taichi]
"From how I see you, you're pretty ghostic."

*ghostic = ghost-like
//Awwwww, I wanted a harder one. 〜IX

[Nanaka]
"I'm not. I have legs."

[Taichi]
"Well......that's......recent ghosts often have legs......"

[Nanaka]
"Well, as to what I am exactly, you'll have to wait for the continuing investigation."

The topic was forcefully averted.

[Taichi]
"......fine by me."

[Nanaka]
"Then I'll give you my card."

I took it.
JOB   Next-Gen Pretty Girl
NAME  〜NANACA〜
I'll heal your heart♪
//Now you finally know why it's "Nanaca Crash" and not "Nanaka Crash." 〜IX

[Taichi]
"............"

What part of this should I comment on?

[Nanaka]
"Hu-huuun."

Nanaka seemed quite proud of it, as if to say,

[Nanaka]
『You can fall in love with me.』

With that sidelong glance and unparalleled childish features.

[Taichi]
"'Nanaka' is romanized wrong."

[Nanaka]
"That's intentional."

A suddenly serious face. I think she's mad.

[Taichi]
"............"

Is this risky?
As a famously capable young adult, there was no atmosphere I couldn't read.
And it told me,
That this girl was bad.
Although, no matter how I think about it, that must be a mistake. That's not possible...
//I immediately saw the "any way" as a mispelling of "anyway." Same meaning and lessons the chance of anyone thinking the same thing now.-Spin
//Changed "but" since it's used in the beginning of the next line as well.-Spin
But......it would be unadvisable to continue interacting with a lunatic.

[Taichi]
"You're extremely cute, but what business have you here?"

[Nanaka]
"Weeell, that was pretty exhilarating..."

Her mood recovered in an instant.
A reaction peculiar to dangerous persons.

[Nanaka]
"When that woman was suffering and agonizing!"

I chuckled.

[Taichi]
"You saw that?"

[Nanaka]
"A glance of it."
[Nanaka]
"That was refreshing!"

[Taichi]
"......do you dislike Youko-chan?"

[Nanaka]
"She's an unpleasant woman. I stick my tongue out at her."

[Taichi]
"I don't know what happened between you and Youko-chan......"

[Nanaka]
"Nothing. We've never met. She just annoys me."
[Nanaka]
"That's why I feel good this morning..."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, is that so?"

[Nanaka]
"That's why I didn't run you over this week."

R-run me over?
I don't know what she means.

[Nanaka]
"That sort of person really isn't good."

[Taichi]
"......you've made it clear that you hate her with a vengeance."

[Nanaka]
"Isn't 'hate' a mistake?"

[Taichi]
"Well......"

How much does she know?

[Nanaka]
"That woman......took Taichi's first after all......so I......"

She got dark.

[Taichi]
"My first?"

[Nanaka]
"Aaah, I remembered something unpleasant. Heh-heh. Forget it."

[Taichi]
"Umm..."

[Nanaka]
"Palate cleansing♪"

*kiss*

[Taichi]
"............!!"
[Taichi]
"Wh-what? Why!?"

[Nanaka]
"Why not? It doesn't wear off."

[Taichi]
"You seem strangely impatient......as a capable young adult, I......"

[Nanaka]
"Well, that woman doesn't matter at all."
[Nanaka]
"Taichiii, make sure you're not tempted and misguided by anything, okay?"

[Taichi]
"Well......I don't think I will."

Really, what is this person?
I can't feel any of the density of something that exists.
She has no presence.

[Nanaka]
"You know, I'm a bit serious today."

[Taichi]
"Haa?"

[Nanaka]
"In the near future, I want you to come to the hokora with me."

[Taichi]
"What? For rape?"

[Nanaka]
"You think I'd do that!!?"
[Nanaka]
"That's not it, I'm being serious. You do know the hokora, right?"

[Taichi]
"Well, yeah."

It's not a place I want to get that close to.
After all that's where---

[Nanaka]
"I'm a little afraid of this sort of thing, but......I want you to come."
[Nanaka]
"After all, compared to that woman, Taichi's not that good at investigating."

[Taichi]
"By 'that woman,' you mean Youko-chan?"

[Nanaka]
"......I don't like it, but she's excellent."

[Taichi]
"The very way she uses her brain is different."
[Taichi]
"It's best not to think much about that."

[Nanaka]
"That's true."
[Nanaka]
"Hey, would you mind? Come with me for a bit!"

We joined hands.
