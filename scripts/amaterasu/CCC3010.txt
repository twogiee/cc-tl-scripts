Consciousness resurfacing.
I raised the periscope of my physical senses.
Based on how hungry I felt, it'd been...three hours?
Since I went to sleep.
It was as if I'd been cryogenically frozen.
......thankfully, they were over capacity.
I opened my eyes.

[Taichi]
"............Miki?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

Smiling.

[Miki]
"I am Miki."

[Taichi]
"I......"

[Miki]
"Ah, please go back to sleep."

[Taichi]
"......I can use your lap?"

[Miki]
"As long as you do nothing perverted."

[Taichi]
"If I do?"

[Miki]
"It depends on the degree of sexual harassment, but..."
[Miki]
"If you do something like dig into my skirt, you'll be shot dead."

[Taichi]
"......I'm sorry."

[Miki]
"So please go right ahead and enjoy my lap♪"

[Taichi]
"Okay."

Soft, and slightly warm.
A good fragrance.
The feel of her uniform, and elasticity of her fresh thighs underneath.
Supreme bliss.

[Taichi]
"I feel like sleeping again."

[Miki]
"You may sleep."

[Taichi]
"But then I wouldn't be able to enjoy this."

[Miki]
"Huhuhu."
[Miki]
"......I was surprised when you collapsed."

[Taichi]
"I was sleeping."

[Miki]
"Again with your ridiculous lifestyle......"
[Miki]
"But, Sempai is the best at those times."

[Taichi]
"......really?"

[Miki]
"Making every day funny and strange. Making as much noise as a festival..."

[Taichi]
"............"

[Miki]
"It makes me...just a little too lonely."

[Taichi]
"Couldn't agree more."
[Taichi]
"You can't go from six billion people to just eight."

[Miki]
"This will influence the continuation of the species."

[Taichi]
"No, that won't happen."

[Miki]
"Why? Why is that?"

[Taichi]
"Hahaha, you already know that."

I extended my hand to her butt.

[Miki]
"Puncture."

I was pierced.

[Taichi]
"O-owww!! What is that!?"

[Miki]
"A knife."

It was a combat knife.

[Taichi]
"That's dangerous! Why are you carrying such a thing!?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin told me to."
[Miki]
"Ah, what pierced you just now wasn't the knife, but one of my fingernails. It was a fake♪"
[Miki]
"It's not bleeding, so don't worry."

[Taichi]
"Ah, I see......"

I was relieved.
I don't want to see blood if I can avoid it.
I can't let that switch become easier to flip.

[Taichi]
"For being defense-oriented, isn't Kiri-chin expanding her armaments a bit much?"

[Miki]
"Miki thinks so too."

[Taichi]
"Flowers are a symbol of peace you know."

I turned over so that I was lying on my stomach.
I buried my face into the side of Miki's lower abdomen.
Her cute delta zone, obstructed by a few layers of clothing.

[Miki]
"Ah! Ah!!"

[Taichi]
"This is in the gray zone, right?"

[Miki]
"If you do that, I'm going to have to carry out my own foreign policy."

[Taichi]
"I am no more than a love aristocrat charmed by a beautiful delta."

[Miki]
"You're going to play with sophistry? In that case,"

She took out a stick.

[Miki]
"Ear cleaning."

Isn't that nice?
A home-run-grade situation.

[Taichi]
"Please do. I mean, please do it even if I say no!"

[Miki]
"......is that okay?"

[Taichi]
"Please take my aural virginity."

[Miki]
"......such an unpleasant image..."

[Taichi]
"Doesn't it make your heart pound?"

[Miki]
"Well, if that is your wish,"

[Taichi]
"Be gentle......"

[Miki]
"I'll make the best of it."
[Miki]
"Though I don't think the result will accompany that."

......eh?
The ear pick was thrust into my ear.
*scrape!*

[Taichi]
"!!!!"

[Miki]
"Already found a big one."

*scrape!* *scrape!* *scrape!*

[Taichi]
"Ooooh nooo---!?"
[Taichi]
"Pain! Pain!"

But Miki didn't stop.

[Miki]
"Huhuhuhuhuhu, this is fun♪ I haven't done it in a while♪"

She's starved for ear cleaning!

[Miki]
"Theeere, there, there."

*rub!* *scrape!* *poke-poke!* *scratch* *scratch* *scratch* *scratch--!*

[Taichi]
"Gieeeeeeeeee!!!"

This is nothing like pain.
Is this not ear torture, or eartor if you meaninglessly shorten it?
*rub!* *scrape!* *slide!*

[Taichi]
"My ear!!"

I produced a scream like that used during Okinawan cooking, and twisted the truth.

[Miki]
"Ah, it's dangerous to move around."

Miki broke her seiza position.
For a moment I saw her panties.
I was filled with happiness for a split second.

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

Legs wrapped around my neck.
Thighs squeezed my cheeks.

[Taichi]
"What are you!!?"

This position......
I had felt the cosmos.
I was enveloped in a girl's thighs.

[Miki]
"This should be fine. Heheheh."

The torture device (ear pick) was thrust into my ear.
*scraaape!*

[Taichi]
"Yaooou!!?"

However, my head was fixed in place.
It felt good but I can't run away. I don't want to run away but I do.
Heaven and hell.
Simultaneously!!

[Taichi]
"Uyayuohinomaueyawoyayuyo{ae}yaeyueyayaupeyowawa!?"

Pain and pleasure.
Alternately rained down and trifled with me.

[Miki]
"Ah, found a boss-class!"
[Miki]
"I shall now commence attack."
[Miki]
"Gooo, gooo, scramble the fighters, it's ear cleaning♪"

She sang aloud.

[Taichi]
"＃＄％＆％---??"
[Taichi]
"Gooooooyaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!"

A scream used by Okinawan chefs once again came out of my mouth.

[Miki]
"Ku! It's strong......okaaay, from the other side."

[Taichi]
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

That moment, pain surpassed pleasure.

[Taichi]
"Th-that's not earwax, that's my braaaaaaaaaain!!?"

That can't be.
But, since it's stuck in there this hard, there's no doubt it's a vital organ.
Oh Miki, please find it in your heart not to tear off this child.

[Taichi]
"P-please, wait! That's gotta be an organ the human body needs! There are things in the human body we think are meaningless but do have meaning! For example, Miki, even that cute little bump of yours has a proper sexual meaning---"

[Miki]
"Drill attack, spiral♪"

[Taichi]
"Nooooooo!!!!!"

I produced a scream which meant (omitted).
My ear brain is!!
It's peeling off with cracking sounds!!

[Taichi]
"I oppose lobotomies!!!"

And then,
*pop!*

[Taichi]
"-----!!!!"

Like a seductress heading for an orgasm, I convulsed sharply.
Since my head was fixed in place, my four limbs undulated like earthworms.

[Miki]
"Yes, I got it......uwaaa, huge, amazing, I won."

I'm dead......
But with that I was released.

[Taichi]
"Y-your lap and thighs are all quite sensual, so, why don't we-"

However, Miki said,

[Miki]
"Now, shall I gain mastery over the opposite ear?"

[Taichi]
"........................eh?"

[Miki]
"Nooow then, now then, I wonder what strong enemies await me in this area."

Her thighs twisted.
Happiness!
I was turned over, breaking that sliver of happiness.
The ear pick was thrust in.

[Taichi]
"Ginyaaaaaaaaaaa!?"

Such a foreign policy......it is to be feared!
Then,

[Taichi]
"......fuoooo......"

Ten minutes later, I was released from the swooningly painful double maiden penetration.
Let us say it was the longest ten minutes of my life.

[Miki]
"Satisfaction, satisfaction♪"
[Miki]
"Do you want to see the results of the war?"

[Taichi]
"I'll pass......"
[Taichi]
"Whoa, I can hear really well."

[Miki]
"There was a lot built up in there."

[Taichi]
"It's like a different world."

[Miki]
"Sempai is the first to be gladdened by my ear cleaning."

I'm not surprised......
No wait, I'm definitely not gladdened.

[Taichi]
"In fact, I should say I was able to endure it thanks to my powerful worldly desires."

[Miki]
"Fuo?"

[Taichi]
"Fuofuofuo."

I laughed it off.

[Taichi]
"By the way, are you searching for Kiri-chin?"

[Miki]
"Aaah, you knew? I can't seem to find her."

[Taichi]
"She was here until three hours ago."

[Miki]
"Somehow I'm just not bumping into her today."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Maybe because of emotional instability?

[Taichi]
"Maybe she wants to be alone."

Come to think of it, today is the day Yutaka died.
Yeah, that's right......that'd do it.

[Taichi]
"......well, why don't we leave her alone for today?"

[Miki]
"Haa..."
[Miki]
"......did she say something?"
[Miki]
"Actually, you did something erotic to Kiricchi, didn't you?"

[Taichi]
"I di-in't."

I denied with an accent.

[Miki]
"Is that trueee?"

It's true that I tried to, but,

[Taichi]
"I am a love gentleman."

[Miki]
"So you tried to, but she said something harsh and went away."

[Taichi]
"............"

[Miki]
"I see."

The image of a master being seen through by a pupil.

[Taichi]
"Well......it was explained to me with ingenious words just how crazy I am."

[Miki]
"That's......"

[Taichi]
"Well, it is the truth."

[Miki]
"............"

To be honest, I was a little depressed.

[Miki]
"Sempai......you know I like you when you're in nice mode, right?"

[Taichi]
"You plan to kill me with compliments? I am a veteran who will not be fooled so easily!"

[Miki]
"Although you're smiling like crazy."

Aaah, I'm so honest!

[Taichi]
"Then will you marry me!!?"

[Miki]
"Why am I being proposed to by someone who's mad at me......?"
[Miki]
"Nnn, well, yeah, sure."

[Taichi]
"Eh, seriously?"

[Miki]
"If Kiri-chin says it's okay."

[Taichi]
"It was too good to be true!"
[Taichi]
"But could you at least write that down for me?"

[Miki]
"......we keep telling you not to act like that."
