I found a virgin stooping down on the way back to my classroom.
It's Miki.
Yamanobe Miki.

[Taichi]
"Heya."

[Miki]
"!!?"

Miki stood up.
Nimble movements.
She turned around slowly.

[Miki]
"Ah, Sempai......hellooo."

She raised her head and greeted me.
Miki gave no indication of being any different.
A slight incongruity.
Was Miki really this strong?
It was in her nature to begin with, but she seemed to be an extra year or two more robust now.
That's what it felt like.

[Taichi]
"What're you doing?"

[Miki]
"Cleaning."

[Taichi]
"I've done cleaning too."

[Miki]
"With some superficial wordplay you're saying 'farewell speech' or 'geometrically similar.'"

[Taichi]
"......I didn't say those things!"
(TL Note: "Cleaning," "geometrically similar," and "farewell speech" are all pronounced "souji" but spelled with different kanji.)

[Miki]
"Why are you mad?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"Why are you quiet?"

[Taichi]
"Don't rush me when I don't have a comeback!!"

[Miki]
"Yaaay, I wooon!"

She was robust.

[Taichi]
"Ah, I thought of something."

I cleared my throat.

[Taichi]
"......I've cleaned humanity."

[Miki]
"You're the culprit!?"

[Taichi]
"Haaa!"

We fought each other.

[Taichi]
"Yo!"
[Taichi]
"Ho!"
[Taichi]
"......ha!?"
[Taichi]
"Oooh!!!?"

One attack hit me in the torso.
Uu, she's strong.
To hit me, one who has mastered karade.
//on purpose? - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"You..."

I got just a little bit serious.

[Miki]
"Shu!"

One of her pliant legs raised above her hips.
I thought about going after her dominant leg, but then I glimpsed her bare panties.
Attack canceled.
For manly Taichi, there is no choice so effeminate as not looking at panties offered right before my eyes.
CSQ 0 1 1 1
  -Look at her panties
  -Look at her panties
  -Look at her panties
Nope, none.
I dropped my hips and lowered my line of sight.
The kick came.
I readied a karade-style mid-level block.
Between my arms, her fingernails softly penetrated my guard.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Impossible.
A hit to the jaw.

[Taichi]
"Wha...?"

I was speechless.
......
............
........................

[Taichi]
"Ha!?"

[Miki]
"Ah, thank God. You're awake now?"

[Taichi]
"Uu, uuu. How long was I out?"

[Miki]
"Not even a minute."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, did I lose to Miki!?"

I hit my knee.

[Miki]
"Taha."
[Miki]
"But didn't you let your guard down completely?"

[Taichi]
"No...that was because there were no other choices for me."
[Taichi]
"......it probably would've been the same even if my life had been at stake."

[Miki]
"Your life for panties!?"

[Taichi]
"Tsk, tsk, tsk."

I wagged my finger.

[Taichi]
"Seeing panties currently being worn by an inexperienced girl in real life."

[Miki]
"That's not true......"

[Taichi]
"As if. Watch this---"

*grab*
My loving fingers grabbed the edge of my beloved pupil's skirt.
//"beloved" or "loving" haha? This is really funny if it's really beloved. - pondrthis
But her fingers got in the way!!

[Taichi]
"Ha!? You blocked it!?"

[Miki]
"Huhuhu."

Shock.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, tell everyone you've earned your license."

I grabbed my knees and curled up like a fried shrimp.

[Taichi]
"With that, I'll retire, yes."

[Miki]
"Why'd you say 'yes'......?"

She rocked me back and forth.

[Miki]
"Shishou, please cheer up."

[Taichi]
"It's okay. I'll go into seclusion."
(TL Note: "Shishou" is how you address your master in a martial art.)

[Miki]
"You've started that again?"
[Miki]
"......"
[Miki]
"Even though......it's not at all..."

[Taichi]
"Oui?"

I asked like a Frenchman.

[Miki]
"Even though everyone's normal..."

Her voice was shaking unexpectedly.

[Taichi]
"Miki-Miki?"

[Miki]
"See, my hands are shaking so much."

Her open hands were sweating, and seemed numb from cold.
Almost as if she was afraid.

[Taichi]
"......why?"

[Miki]
"That's because, after seeing Sempai acting so gloomy, cowardly Miki can't help but be worried."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"So please, cheer up."

[Taichi]
"Nnn."

Is she comforting me?
Her weird behavior bugs me, but...
Hmmm, isn't she getting fluffy?

[Taichi]
"Okay, then why don't we tell everyone about your license?"

I punched my palm.

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Take out your notebook."

[Miki]
"......aah, aah......so that's it."
[Miki]
"Haven't done that in a while..."

She made a truly pained face.
In fact she seems (In fact she seems) like she's about to cry (about to cry).
I thought it through compoundly.
//Just sounded weird.-Spin
Miki took out her Matebook.
That's what they call the notebook which also doubles as the school's identification card and as the #1 popular high-class public bathhouse available behind the train station of this 『City』.
Why is it called that?
It's really just a coincidence.

[Miki]
"......sun."

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

She's crying.
In fact it seems (In fact it seems) like she's crying (like she's crying).
I thought that compoundly as well.

[Taichi]
"......so, you were receiving quite a shock?"

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"About the world becoming like this."

[Miki]
"Yeah......"

There was a slight benefit.

[Miki]
"That's right, maybe I am."

[Taichi]
"You would be."
[Taichi]
"It surprised me too."

[Miki]
"Sempai too?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."
[Taichi]
"Now there will never be an opportunity for me to meet any new virgins at the ages of thirteen or fifteen."

[Miki]
"Is that what this is about?"

[Taichi]
"It is."

I took her notebook from her.

[Taichi]
"You've nearly used up your notebook, Miki. It's falling apart."

[Miki]
"Falling apart."

Miki meaninglessly repeated my words as a form of agreement.
As I flipped through the pages, I found my very large signatures already scribbled in the margins.
This continued over several pages.
It was as if she was collecting my signatures.
I found a blank page and wrote in a new signature.
This has been how we played with one another for a long time now.
For our own sakes.
I returned her notebook.
Miki took it and held it to her chest.
Tightly.
As if embracing her lost soul.
//That sounds better and makes more sense.-Spin
I even wiped away some of her tears.
Waa...I'm a gentleman.

[Miki]
"Thank you......"

[Taichi]
"It was nothing."

I looked around the hallway.

[Taichi]
"Still, cleaning of all things."

[Miki]
"I was thinking that moving my body about might help me calm down."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."
