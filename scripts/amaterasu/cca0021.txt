*ding* *dong* *dang* *dong*
*ding* *dong* *dang* *dong*
This morning, club activities on the roof are proceeding vigorously.

[Taichi]
"Hey youuuuu!!!"

[Misato]
"Y-yes!!?"

One yell from me, and from the top of the ladder, Sempai...
*fump*
...fell off.

[Misato]
"Owwwww."

[Taichi]
"The silent pheasant remains unshot."

[Misato]
"I...I'm not a pheasant..."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Miss injured person. Why was it now?"

The meaning doesn't matter at all. This is about sensibility.
(TL Note: Taichi is trying and failing to speak English.)

[Misato]
"Uuu."

[Taichi]
"And while I wasn't around as well..."

[Misato]
"I...I wasn't sneaking in or anything......I just couldn't stop worrying about it, and I woke up at five this morning."

Using this excuse, Sempai explained herself with copious body language.

[Taichi]
"......you're a traitor."

[Misato]
"No, no I'm not!"

[Taichi]
"Aaaah, Misato-sempai, you're heartless..."

[Misato]
"Aaah, that's why......"
[Misato]
"Okay, it's my loss. I'm sorry."

Both of her hands rose up.

[Taichi]
"Seven-fifty AM: caught a criminal in the act."

[Misato]
"Oookay♪"

She held out both hands.
And on those wrists,
*click*

[Misato]
"......eh?"

Ah, crap......I just...

[Misato]
"What...is this?"

[Taichi]
"Handcuffs......"

[Misato]
"A toy, right?"

[Taichi]
"They're real......"

Silence.

[Misato]
"Wh-wwwwhy are you carrying real ones around?"

[Taichi]
"Th-tttthe kouban was empty and some handcuffs had been left outside, so I picked them up on my way here......"

[Misato]
"What the......hehe, well, you are hopeless♪"
(TL Note: A kouban is a very small neighborhood police station, and is unique to Japan's police system.)

She was fuming.

[Taichi]
"Ahaha, I'm sooorry."

Two laughs.

[Misato]
"The key is?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, the key......yeah......the key is...I wonder wheeere?"

Our smiles froze.

[Misato]
"Hmmm."
[Misato]
"Ahahaaa."

She laughed.

[Misato]
"I'm sorry, Peke-kun. I thought I just heard you say 'I wonder where the key is?'..."

[Taichi]
"Because that's what I just said."

She became expressionless.

[Misato]
"You are now in a position where you'll have no right to complain even if I become violent."

[Taichi]
"Th-that's okay for certain reasons!"

I was attacked.

[Taichi]
"Ugya!"

[Misato]
"Why......are you so careless......"

[Taichi]
"Umm, it's a conditional reflex......"

[Misato]
"But this won't come off without a key, now will it?"

[Taichi]
"Well......well......shouldn't we just look for the key?"

[Misato]
"......might it be in that kouban?"

[Taichi]
"Of course. I'll look for it on my way home today."

[Misato]
"You'll go this instant. Right?"

*grind* *grind* *grind*......

[Taichi]
"Yesss......right away."

With the W Iron Claw presently active, I had no room to answer otherwise.

[Taichi]
"But please stay where you are until I come back."

[Misato]
"But I can't even change clothes like this."

[Taichi]
"For now, why don't you go into a classroom?"

[Misato]
"I guess so......"

We both entered the building.

[Misato]
"It'd be nice if no one finds us......"

[Taichi]
"Why's that?"

[Misato]
"Doesn't it look like I'm being escorted to prison?"

[Taichi]
"Since you ask, it looks more like some kind of 'play.'"

[Misato]
"Pu-re-i?"
(TL Note: The English word "play" is used in Japanese to imply unspecified "sexual play.")

[Taichi]
"Sempai's classroom was on the third floor, right?"

[Misato]
"Ah, there it is."

Miki came over from there.

[Miki]
"'Ello!"

[Misato]
"!!?"

Sempai frantically tried to hide her wrists, but failed.
The towel covering her wrists slid right off.
She should've just stayed still.

[Miki]
"......"
[Miki]
"......she...she's being arrested......"

[Misato]
"No I'm not, this is a prank."

[Miki]
"......"
[Miki]
"Umm, Sempai?"

She raised her hand.

[Taichi]
"What is it, Inspector Yamanobe?"

[Miki]
"Sir! The health room appears to be open today!"

She saluted while introducing us to a good location for 'play.'
Uuu, she's so nice......

[Misato]
"?"

The innocent Sempai did not understand.

[Taichi]
"Well, thank you. What about yourself?"

[Miki]
"Ah, I think I'd like to remain a virgin a bit longer, so..."

[Taichi]
"That's a shame. Bye."

[Miki]
"Your work is much appreciated."

She bowed her head and saw us off.

[Misato]
"I didn't understand that conversation very well."

[Taichi]
"It'd be amazing if you had understood it."

[Misato]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Now,"

The train station.
And quite a run-down one at that.
But the lack of litter was some consolation.
The kouban......is very close to here.
An 'On Patrol' sign had been hung up, and no one was in there.
I found the key quickly.
I wonder if this counts as theft.
Of course it does.
And of police property.
The final crime of the misdemeanor king, Arsene Taichi.

[Taichi]
"Got it."
(TL Note: Undoubtedly a reference to Arsene Lupin.)

I'd better get back soon.
No one goes past the station.
This station is nothing but a connection between the city and the residential district to begin with, so it's never that busy.
This open region of inorganic asphalt was hot enough to create small shimmers in the air.
It was as if no cars were to be seen.
So I walked down the center of the road.

[Taichi]
"......"

There's no one to assign the blame.
Why is that?
Think about a world like this:
No matter what crime you stain your hands with, no one will ever blame anyone, and you'll never have to be blamed.
A lawless world.
But I'm the only one here right now.
In a world with just me, what kind of crimes are there?
None.
Without points of connection between people, the majority of sins evaporate and lose meaning.
Idealistic.
You could call it an ideal society.
To be alone. To throw away the masses.
What abilities are needed for that?
Or is a suitable mental construct what's needed?
Humans have many and varied desires.
They continue to exist even in different dimensions from such wants like 'I want to drink water.'
What is desire?
A desire for success.
A desire for knowledge.
A desire to create.
A desire to conquer.
Those are things with values decided either by others or by comparing oneself with others.
Desire might just be a manifestation of wanting the consent of others.
I want to have more wealth than other people.
I want to have more knowledge than other people.
I want to succeed more than other people.
The prerequisite of others.
The root of desire lies in attaining that which many people acknowledge as valuable.
One of the clearer forms of that is currency.
Even without an intended use for it, people will crave it.
When humans live together with desire, their world is already being colored by the thoughts and values of others, and their characters thereby take shape.
But if one were alone?
How would his desires modify?
No, the moment others disappeared, desires would lose that definition and become wants.
A race with no rival doesn't constitute a competition, and thus high running speeds are no longer sought after.
How many people are there in a world with only themselves, and who therefore are true intellectuals?
Can they continue to create art without any viewers?
Who are they to overcome?
Yes.
When alone, people change.
They can't not change.
The burdens of emotions that force them upward would no longer be minuses.
If the world became one where sins weren't sins...
I felt something like a revelation, telling me my 『eyes』 were for that purpose.
I turned around.

[Taichi]
"......how long do you intend to follow me?"

My voice traveled far in this unpopulated space.

[Taichi]
"Don't you have other things to do?"

I waited.
But there was no answer.

[Taichi]
"Do something."

I spat out those words and set off toward school.
I can't preoccupy myself with every little thing.
The fearsome presence continued to tail me.
I'm thankful she's worrying about me.
But, still.

[Taichi]
"Because my hair is white, I'll never get sunstroke!!!"

This might be something like getting irritated with one's mother.
It had a certain freshness, but it was thoroughly annoying.
I went as far as the school walls before exhaling from relief.
Because the presence had disappeared.

[Taichi]
"......that was sooo annoying."

Even though it happens all the time, I got goosebumps.
From that dense existence.

[Taichi]
"Are you a demon?"

She might be near.
It's a pain to be loved by such a thing.
*growlllllllll*
My stomach bug.
Like a beast.
(TL Note: A common Japanese personification of the noises one's stomach makes when hungry.)
Maybe I should call it my stomach beast.

[Taichi]
"I smell food......"

My feet spun toward the cafeteria.
