[Taichi]
"Hurry up! Hurry up!"

And then,

[Taichi]
"Here we are..."

[Kiri]
"Haa, haa, hee, hee."

Kiri was exhausted.

[Miki]
"Oooh, good timing!"

Miki was perfectly fine.
A calculating girl.

[Taichi]
"It's nice that we got here before dark, but we also have to get back before dark."
(TL Note: This might be a pun because "genkin (calculating)" sounds like "genki (energetic)".)

I do happen to have a flashlight in the Taichi Bag, but...

[Miki]
"I wanted to see the evening sun, so this is just right."
[Miki]
"And there we go!"

Then Miki pulled the flowers in both her hands (one of which was me) closer to her.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

[Kiri]
"Kyan."

[Miki]
"The prettiest part is right before it sinks."

We've already been out for thirty minutes.

[Kiri]
"......haa, I'm hungryyy."

[Miki]
"Do you have some kind of food, Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"I do."

I took out the remaining canned bread.

[Miki]
"Does that bag which a homeless person might use have everything in it?"

[Taichi]
"It is the Taichi Bag."

[Miki]
"My throat's parched."

[Taichi]
"Here you go."

A water bottle.

[Miki]
"......a-amazing."

She must have wanted it.

[Taichi]
"Want to eat some cookies?"

Made by Youko-chan.

[Miki]
"I'll take them! Here, Kiricchi."

[Kiri]
"O-okay......"

They both ate vigorously.

[Miki]
"These cookies......are delicious..."

[Kiri]
"They're......really soft...and sweet......"

[Taichi]
"Because they're Youko-chan's cookies."

[Miki]
"You are so loooved."

[Taichi]
"She is partial to me."

My annoyance is higher than my thankfulness.

[Taichi]
"But I'd like her to turn off the surveillance cameras."

My room.
Though the batteries are dead and she can't use them anymore.

[Kiri]
"......so, what's Miki waiting for?"

[Miki]
"The evening sun."

[Kiri]
"Isn't it evening now?"

[Taichi]
"Mikicchi's waiting for the afterglow."

[Kiri]
"Afterglow?"

[Taichi]
"After the sun goes away, the sky turns this amazing shade of orange."

[Miki]
"All three of us will see it. Won't that feel good?"

This doesn't feel like a date so much as a friendly outing.

[Miki]
"Nyan-niki-nyaka-nyaka♪ Nyan-niki-nyaka-nyaka♪"

[Kiri]
"Don't touch my breasts."

Well, it's okay since it's fun.

[Taichi]
"......hey, Kiri-chin, unmanageable lust."

[Kiri]
"Bu!!!"

[Taichi]
"Don't spit water."

[Kiri]
"Did she tell you!? Did she show it to you!?"

[Miki]
"I didn't show him. It's fine, it's fine."

I've got a general idea of what happened.

[Taichi]
"Do you two remember the first day you participated in the club?"

[Kiri]
"......well, yes."
[Kiri]
"It'd be impossible to forget that, even if I tried."

[Miki]
"We didn't fit in all that well."

[Taichi]
"......nnn, not until the exams ended. You did have to adapt."

Students couldn't join clubs freely.
Hope gets across, but,
Gunjou was an elevator institution, minus the university.
Kiri came here during the summer of last year.
(TL Note: An "elevator" system refers to elementary, middle, high school and sometimes college all run together in the same place. It also implies that students will advance in grade level almost automatically.)
Miki came a little after that.
They both were admitted one year below the third years.
They were in the same building, so they met rather often during that time.

[Miki]
"That was fun. I can't forget that."

[Kiri]
"......it was fun."

[Taichi]
"I even gave you both wonderful nicknames."

[Miki]
"Ummm, Shima-sempai was Immoral, and Taichi-sempai was Love Aristocrat?"

She remembers well.

[Miki]
"......'Love Aristocrat' pops up frequently in Sempai's talks."

[Kiri]
"Love slave, love doll......you're the worst."
[Kiri]
"Why not call yourself the worst slave?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm......the worst of the slaves...I'm all the way at the bottom."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, that's too much..."

[Taichi]
"Also, do you remember Sakuraba's sermon on persimmon trees?"

[Kiri]
"......puuuu!!?"

Kiri spat.
It seems she remembered.

[Miki]
"Now that you mention it, I have a question."
[Miki]
"Does Sakuraba-sempai have bad hearing?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, his eardrum hurts."

[Miki]
"Eh!?"

[Kiri]
"......I didn't know that."

[Taichi]
"I did it."

Kiri's eyebrows narrowed.

[Kiri]
"Don't make light of that."

[Taichi]
"Hey, listen to me. He started it."
[Taichi]
"......in my middle school period......nnn, I guess it was my second year. We had a school festival."

[Miki]
"They don't do that now?"

[Taichi]
"Because a lot of problems occurred."
[Taichi]
"It was a pretty snug thing at the time. There really aren't that many intellectuals."

*Intellectual = One who has delight, anger, sorrow, pleasure and other emotions.

[Miki]
"......"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"But, even this school wants approval from the residents around it."
[Taichi]
"Though it was a school festival, a bunch of strangers always showed up and made a lot of people insecure, so they started doing something like a volunteer play."
[Taichi]
"That year was......Shakespeare. The title was---"

[Kiri]
"Romeo and Juliet."

[Taichi]
"......correct."

Yes.

[Miki]
"It was beta."

[Taichi]
"Yep. You could even say it was Betty."
(TL Note: "Beta" in Japanese is a sound effect for stickiness, here implying something was laid on too thick, i.e. the play was overacted.)

[Kiri]
"......ha?"

[Miki]
"He personified 'beta' and......"

[Kiri]
"......aaah, that's what he meant......"

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu. Nice follow-up, Miki."

[Miki]
"'Twas nothing."

[Taichi]
"I've decided: the day I explain one of my own gags is the day I die."

[Kiri]
"......sounds like a line from a movie."

[Taichi]
"Well, anyway, we did Shakespeare. His Japanese name would be......hu! Furiyari-san I would think."

Miki's body shook.
(TL Note: "Furiyari" = "shaking a spear".)

[Miki]
"......I couldn't feel any hint of desire to think hard about that!!!"

One more person captured by my frankness.
(TL Note: The kanji for "furi" and "yari" would never be pronounced that way in a real name.)

[Taichi]
"I don't believe in twists."

I looked up at the madder red sky like a homeless person.
(TL Note: "To think hard" = "to twist one's head" in Japanese.)

[Kiri]
"Did he misspell something?"

[Miki]
"Dunno."

[Taichi]
"Try to guess the casting!"

[Miki]
"......I wonder...was Sempai Romeo?"

[Kiri]
"We don't know who else was there at the time...... so I don't know......"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan was a year above me."

[Miki]
"Then, Hasekura-sempai was Juliet."

[Taichi]
"Unfortunately, you've got it backwards."

[Miki]
"......a gender-swapped play?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. At the time, we had about the same build, so it didn't matter who played who."
[Taichi]
"Also...there was no one else they knew who could act in a play, so Youko-chan and I played all the parts."

[Kiri]
"Uwa......"

[Miki]
"Is that......really a school festival?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it was just to save face."
[Taichi]
"The play itself was a huge success. Especially the realistic acting in the kiss scene......that bitch......in front of people......"

[Kiri]
"Th-this person's crying......"

[Miki]
"What did we do?"

[Taichi]
"Dammit! I didn't even have any chest hair at the time!!"

[Miki]
"You have some now......?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, although there was saliva dribbling out from the mouths of the two kissing,
[Taichi]
"And although the heroine decided the main character would submit to her even though I was trying to run away,
[Taichi]
"It must have been the magic of the play that kept anyone from noticing her persistent touching under a certain region of my skirt.
[Taichi]
"The play was a huge success. I changed my underwear."

[Kiri]
"......no............"

[Taichi]
"And there emerged the new character, Sakurabaaa!"

[Miki]
"There he is."

[Taichi]
"That guy's an instinctively faithful man. No, he's rather too faithful a man."
[Taichi]
"Sakuraba came to watch the play, and he fell in love at first sight."

[Kiri]
"With Hasekura-sempai......"

[Taichi]
"No, with me."

[Miki]
"......"

[Kiri]
"......"

Both of them: "Eeeeeeeeeeeeeh!!!?"
My eardrums were nearly torn.

[Miki]
"Eeh? Eeh? Sakuraba-sempai and Taichi-sempai!!?"

[Kiri]
"Hey, hey, then the rumor that Sakuraba-sempai had no interest at all in women was...?"

[Miki]
"Hyaaaa! What's happeniiing!?"

[Kiri]
"Wa! Waaaa..."

[Miki]
"Kyaaa, kyaaa!"

You're too loud......
Both of them: "So, what happened?"

[Taichi]
"That reaction is somehow irritating."
[Taichi]
"......anyway, Sakuraba forced himself on me. He soon appeared backstage holding a flower from the principal's flower bed."
[Taichi]
"I was surprised. It took three seconds to get from meeting to confession. Fast, too fast."

They both held their breath.
......somehow I want to talk about it now.

[Taichi]
"Unhappily, Youko-chan wasn't there."
[Taichi]
"But I was calm. After all, I was a guy. I was lacking in holes to physically receive Sakuraba's love (adult joke)."
[Taichi]
"That's why I exposed my own symbol, proving that I was a guy. That's what they call symbolism."

[Miki]
"......that's a lie."

[Kiri]
"Yep, it's a lie."

[Miki]
"What a boring gag."

[Kiri]
"Yes, but let's put up with it. The story is getting good."

[Taichi]
"......may I cry?"
[Taichi]
"But Sakuraba wouldn't stop."

[Sakuraba]
『I'm fine with a guy.』

[Taichi]
"And then he attacked me. Actually, there was one hole I had a hunch could accept him (adult joke)."

[Miki]
"Uwoooooooo!!"

[Kiri]
"Th-that's......"

Hey, why are you enjoying this?

[Taichi]
"So, in order to protect my chastity, I repeatedly slapped him. I hit his ear, so......well I ended up hurting him a little."

[Miki]
"Aaah, so that's why his ear is a little......"

[Taichi]
"Afterward I went and apologized to his father. But it was attempted rape, so I wasn't blamed for anything."
[Taichi]
"The guy never listened to what people said in the first place, but it seems I polished that ability."
[Taichi]
"So, Sakuraba was taken to the hospital......and it was all right after that."
[Taichi]
"The next school year, he was my classmate......"

[Kiri]
"He came after you?"

[Taichi]
"Probably......"

[Miki]
"So, how've you two been since?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing's happened! Or I should say, the guy doesn't seem inclined to do anything with my full-width asterisk."

*Full-width asterisk = 『＊』←This instead of 『*』←this.

[Miki]
"Platonic Lo......"

[Taichi]
"Don't say it."

I held my head.

[Taichi]
"To be honest, I have no emotion other than... complex."

[Miki]
"So that's why you harass him."

[Taichi]
"......how else would you have me react?"
[Taichi]
"Besides, that guy acts abnormally familiar with me if I leave him alone."

I got goosebumps.

[Taichi]
"So much has come of......actually, I'm at the age where I want to scream to the evening sun that all I desire are normal human relationships. Okay, I'm done. Was that interesting enough?"

They both nodded.

[Miki]
"That was really interesting, it was."

[Taichi]
"......Misato-sempai and Touko's eyes changed colors when they heard this story......women......"

[Miki]
"Kyaaa, kyaaa."

[Kiri]
"Kyaaa, kyaaa."

They were already talking about 'kyaaa kyaaa.'
High-pitched voices.
I could only sigh.
In the end, I told everyone about it.

[Taichi]
"......hey, Miki, while we were talking about that, it nearly happened."

[Miki]
"Ueh......ah."

A sunken sun. Only that light clambered up the sky.
Like air shimmering in heat, it only tinged the lower half of the sky.

[Miki]
"........................"

[Taichi]
"Wow."

It was an amazing thing.
The world was still spinning even without people.

[Kiri]
"......uwwaa."

It was overpowering.
Without words, the three of us were enchanted by that scene.
At long last,

[Miki]
"......aha."

A crazy voice, as if laughing---

[Miki]
"Aha, hahahahahaha!"

She was crying.
She pulled our arms closer.

[Miki]
"Ahahahaa, *sob* aha!......Ahaaa......uu! Uu! Uu! Uu......"

[Kiri]
"Miki, what's wrong?"

[Miki]
"It's beautiful......isn't it?......It's beau...... uwaaaa......"

[Taichi]
"......Miki."

We didn't know the reason why Miki was crying.
We could only feel bad.

[Miki]
"It's beautiful! Beauti......haha! *sob* ha............"

The image of the afterglow disappeared behind the curve of the Earth, sent off by a tearful voice.

[Miki]
"Uwaaaaaaa---"

She was sobbing convulsively.
