Touko was there.
Come to think of it, isn't she always the first to show up here?

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Touko]
"......(hmph)"

Cold shoulder?
You're giving me the cold shoulder?

[Taichi]
"Panties......"

[Touko]
"Tedious."

[Taichi]
"Would you buy my panties?"

[Touko]
"Whyyy do I have to buy your panties!?"

Touko shoved her desk aside as she stood up.

[Taichi]
"You're hot-tempered in the morning."

I gave her a thumbs-up.

[Touko]
"......"

Touko grabbed my thumb and jerked it sharply to one side.

[Taichi]
"Gieeeeeeee!!!"
[Taichi]
"You moron! What if you broke it!? How am I supposed to masturbate now!?"

I'm just glad I didn't lose my whole hand.

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me."

[Taichi]
"Did you watch the TV yesterday?"

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me!"

[Taichi]
"......muu."

If you tell me not to talk to you with such a bitter tongue, that just makes me want to talk more.
But when I speak to her again, her bitter tongue once more tells me not to talk.
