......impossible.
There's no way I can accept death.
It's true that I hate myself.
I hate everything about myself.
I despise my own hideousness and the depth of my desires.
Self-hatred that's above the hatred Kiri holds.
But......if I was going to commit suicide, I would've done it by now.
I'll live.
If I don't......then what was I fighting for?
I had to live, even if it meant......breaking Kiri.

[Taichi]
"......I have one question: the one who saw me and Yutaka on the roof......was it you?"

[Kiri]
"Yes, that's right."
[Kiri]
"At the time I thought nothing of it."
[Kiri]
"But......now I know."
[Kiri]
"Like you did to me in the bathroom, you......drove Yutaka into a corner."
[Kiri]
"In order to satisfy yourself!"

[Taichi]
"How would I do that?"

[Kiri]
"......reproaching Yutaka for his legs......there are many ways."
[Kiri]
"I don't think I want to ask what exactly you did."
[Kiri]
"Are you finished?"

Her hand remained shaking.
It was as if she'd lose herself before killing me.

[Taichi]
"Would one last thing be okay? It might be a bit of a long story though."

[Kiri]
"......go ahead."

What did she think on the inside?
Kiri had spoken flatly as if to prevent me from feeling the answer.

[Taichi]
"......may I sit?"

[Kiri]
"Go ahead."

[Taichi]
"Will you sit too, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"............"

Ignore.
Whatever.
I started talking.

[Taichi]
"A long time ago, there was a family called the Hasekuras."
[Taichi]
"They had a big house. A Western style mansion. I think it was at least ten times as big as the Kiriharas'."
[Taichi]
"They were huge millionaires."
[Taichi]
"I......my mother died when I was young, and I got picked up by them."
[Taichi]
"I lived and worked there, for a husband and wife who were distant relatives of my mother."
[Taichi]
"It was a house of old customs."
[Taichi]
"The children of servants were also servants."
[Taichi]
"Since I was a child, my role was something like playing with the children of the house."
[Taichi]
"Youko-chan was their youngest daughter."
