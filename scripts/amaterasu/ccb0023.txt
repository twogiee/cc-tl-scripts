It felt like my body had been pushed into the ground with a thud.

[Taichi]
"......nn."

'That's right,' I thought.
I came to a strange understanding.
One arrow piercing through my own chest.
That's right.
That's right, that's right.
I must have moved.
So Kiri shot me.
It was actually easy to understand.
*****: "**************---!?"
Who is that?
I wonder who's worrying about me?
Maybe Sempai?
Maybe Touko?
Maybe Miki?
If it's Sakuraba or Tomoki......that'd be painful...
Sorry, I'm going to die.
I wasn't able to keep......the vow of the peach park......
Well, I'd actually broken it a long time ago.
Hahaha.
Hahahaha.
I wanted to laugh but I had no voice.
From my chest, a hazy pressure welled up.
Looking at my chest, I saw that the blood I'd thrown up had flowed down to my feet.
This is a big deal.
Shit, I'm really going to die.
I don't want to die...
I really, really want to live.
I want to do a lot of perverted things, and watch television, even see the conclusions of several serialized manga.

//Too many "and"s but it sounded so wrong when I deleted one so I changed it to "even."-Spin
No...I don't wanna die...
Aaah, but I'm a young adult candidate, so I wonder if I can bring myself back to life with some magical power.
A pretty girl will cling on to my remains, letting her tears fall, and when those drops touch me they'll sparkle brightly for a moment and resurrect me.
That'd be emotional.
Then, for now I guess I'll try to meet my death with some kind of gag.
It's a cool thing for a guy to do.
I can't talk, and I can't move most of my body......so I can't do anything that flashy.
Hey, I can't do a damn thing.
Uwaa, am I going to die like this!? I can't stand it!
Someone please drop a washtub on my head!!
Give me...give me a laugh!
Dowaa, blood is horrible!
It's even wider than before. The whole surface is bloody.
For this much blood to flow out of one human......there must be a lot in them.
Everything was red.
If I can still recognize color, then I'm still me.
Had I 『returned』 by the skin of my teeth?
Yes.
It's a good thing.
Suddenly, sensation returned to me above the neck.
It's probably temporary.
The shock is restoring muscles in every part of my body.
......although it won't last that long.
My consciousness was already dim.
My breathing was already unnaturally short and shallow.
I couldn't even tell if I was in pain.
When I looked up...
The red had expanded without end.
......'Not bad,' I thought.
//I'm assumed Taichi's last word is referring to Youko-chan's handling of the situation, and adapted it accordingly. 〜IX
At that moment, I died.
