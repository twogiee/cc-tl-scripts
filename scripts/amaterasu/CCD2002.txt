The first time Touko came to Gunjou,
She was surrounded by high walls.
//There has to be a better expression for personal fortress, being estranged, unattainable, isolated by (...) -Neko
She obeyed like a subordinate.
I liked her the moment I saw her.
Call it my cat-like disposition.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"......what is it?"

[Taichi]
"Are you rich?"

[Touko]
"............"

I was ignored.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"......what?"

[Taichi]
"You're a beauty."

[Touko]
"........................"

Her cheeks tightened faintly.
From that, I understood her general texture.
And now, Touko was there 『as always.』
//?????? - Sheeta
//It's supposed to be in the brackets right?-Spin
Every week, every single week.
I'd contacted an unlimited number of Toukos.
//Endless seems better here, as it's standing an infinite number of outputs. Unlimited sounds more numerical, something that can't be exhausted. -Neko
I had only seen conclusions that were far from happiness.
//You use I'd too much -Neko
Touko and I were repeating.
Nothing but failures. It makes me laugh.
//"We're" would be a harmless, more fluid additions. This could be read two ways "Touko and I" or "The situations consisted of". We're eliminates the discrepancy. -Neko
......words might not be needed.
It may be okay to just look at her.
//Might redundancy without any sense repitive enforcement. -Neko
That might be a bond.

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
".................."

[Touko]
".................."

[Taichi]
"............................................."
//Too many periods leading to game crash. Fixed to working amount - Raide

[Touko]
"......what is it with you!!?"

She suddenly stood up.

[Taichi]
"You're beautiful."

[Touko]
"Wh---whwhwhwh-!?"

[Taichi]
"Hahahaha."

......I was chased out.

[Taichi]
"Guess that's no good."

This is very hard.

[Taichi]
"The same ending as always......"
//Result or Conclusion would enforce definition here. Ending is vague. -Neko

Whatever.
I figured I could take this lightly.
As usual, Touko was absentmindedly sitting in the classroom.
Just simply being there, with no objective.
Because she can't do anything.
A Touko with nothing but inertia.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"......eh......?"

She hesitated because I called her 'Touko.'

[Taichi]
"Hold out your hands."

[Touko]
"......no."

Okay, she's taking the bait.

[Taichi]
"I can imagine what you're being wary of,"
[Taichi]
"But this time's different."

[Touko]
"Didn't you say that last time!?"
[Touko]
"You think I'll be fooled by that!?"

[Taichi]
"......this is a problem."

[Touko]
"You obviously want to make me hold your......"

[Taichi]
"Just a greeting; nothing like what you're thinking."

[Touko]
"I don't want it."

Muu, she's tough.
I'll forcibly violate her.

[Taichi]
"Hands."

I took her hands by force.
The impulse to make her grip it boiled up, but I held back.
//I assume 'it' = Taichi's penis, so I changed it accordingly. - Sheeta
//This should be reverted to it. The implication is specific, while "me" could imply gripping his hands, his body, anything really. -Neko

[Touko]
"Hey......"

Her face went pale.
She must have thought that her hands would be raped.
I would like to, but I won't do it now.

[Taichi]
"Eat mother's flavor."

*plop* *plop* *plop*
Three round candies rolled around on the palm of her hand.

[Touko]
"Ah."

[Taichi]
"Be at ease. My two hundred million small wonderful lives aren't inside those."
//Who the hell is leaving these comments? It's been bugging me for a while.-Spin
[Taichi]
"They're on vacation (alol)."

[Touko]
"......of course they are."

*squeeze*
Touko gripped the candies.

[Taichi]
"You should be able to live for a while with enough sugar intake."

Cheap jokes should also be forgiven if done three at a time.

[Taichi]
"Even if you don't have an appetite, make sure you practice putting things in your mouth."

Touko glared at her fist.

[Touko]
"......you're...always like that."
[Touko]
"Pretending to be kind, being an idiot, being cold and distant, being scary."
[Touko]
"I don't understand."

She covered her face.

[Touko]
"......I'm begging you, leave me alone."

[Taichi]
"Ooohhh."

She's mad at me.
But I achieved my objective, so I won't worry about it.

[Taichi]
"Pretending to be kind......hmm..."

She hadn't said it with much thought, but it hit the mark.
//"Target" isn't exactly right. I remember hearing this saying before but I don't remember if it was "mark" or "bullseye."-Spin
Touko was like this last year too.
And I am acting the same as always after all---
Kurosu Taichi's harassment of Touko continued.
No one besides me ever tried to talk to her.
That wasn't because of malice.
There were those at Gunjou who could have held a conversation, but Touko herself rejected them.
Because everyone was sensitive to malice---
But I practically feed on it.
//Malice redundancy is ineffective here. Such things or it would suffice. -Neko

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, where's your lunch?"

[Touko]
"......I don't need one."

Kuu...

[Taichi]
"But......your stomach's growling."

[Touko]
"......shut up!!"

[Taichi]
"You're cute when you're angry. Kirihara's face looks better when it's full of rage."

I used a variant of the pickup line 『You're cute when you're smiling. Kirihara's face looks better with a smile on it.』

[Touko]
"Be quiet."

It shouldn't produce any development.
//It's implication is obscure here. You lost me -Neko

[Taichi]
"You're rich, why don't you have a bentou at least?"

[Touko]
"......I said I don't need one."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Right before her eyes, I was greedily devouring my bentou.
Kuu...

[Touko]
"............"

Her face was already red.

[Taichi]
"By the way, do you not know how the cafeteria works or something?"

Touko had been looking down the whole time, but she finally nodded slightly.

[Touko]
"......I've always been in dorms until now."

[Taichi]
"So you've only used dormitories and butlers."

[Touko]
"Why do you have to line up to get food......it's meaningless."

[Taichi]
"It's amazing that you can honestly say that."

She's not ordinary. That's what I thought.

[Taichi]
"Okay, come with me."

I pulled her hand.

[Touko]
"Eeeh!? Th-that's okay......"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it. I try to be friendly to beauties."

[Touko]
"A-again you say things that make me want to grind my teeth......"

[Taichi]
"If Kirihara opened her heart more, I think she'd be able to have a fun life."

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Now, let's go."

[Touko]
"I-I said wait!!"

A one-sided relationship like that based on curiosity...
//With seems unnecessary here. "It was like that", or simply ditch with. -Neko
........................

[Taichi]
"I heard you got in trouble with the teacher again."

[Touko]
"......that has nothing to do with you."

[Taichi]
"About you not wearing the uniform."

[Touko]
"I never accepted becoming a student here."
//Now I get why he/she put the period outside. Damn Brits always ruining English.-Spin

[Taichi]
"But, wasn't that decision made by the exam?"

[Touko]
"That thing......"

[Taichi]
"Which means there's a possibility that Kirihara will hurt people."

[Touko]
"I've never done such a thing!"

[Taichi]
"I think so too."

[Touko]
"......haa?"

[Taichi]
"I think so too."

If she had,
Touko would probably just destroy herself.
........................

[Taichi]
"......Kirihara, do you hate Gunjou?"

[Touko]
"Of course I hate it. After all, I'm perfectly fine."
[Touko]
"This is all a bad joke."

[Taichi]
"......really? I find it fun."
[Taichi]
"It's easy."

[Touko]
"How?......We're being watched every day......and treated as abnormals..."

[Taichi]
"But it's nothing to be afraid of."

[Touko]
"......that has nothing to do with me."

[Taichi]
"Then, do you hate me?"

[Touko]
"I hate you."

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahaha."

........................

[Taichi]
"You really are......alone all the time."
[Taichi]
"You can't make friends like that."

[Touko]
"Don't need 'em."

[Taichi]
"Why not join a club?"

[Touko]
"......I won't."

[Taichi]
"Nnn...but they're fun..."

[Touko]
"Why are you inviting me? Aren't there plenty of others?"

[Taichi]
"Kirihara's fine."

[Touko]
"......wh-why......?"

[Taichi]
"Because I like Kirihara."

[Touko]
"......that's bothersome."

'I warm up to people because I like them, I'm harmless, and I want to be their friend.'
//Massive adaptation here. I can only pray I understood the line correctly. 〜IX
I continued putting out such an aura.
It was nearly brainwashing.
........................
At some point, Touko asked me,

[Touko]
"Kurosu, why are you here?"

[Taichi]
"......because my heart is sick."

[Touko]
"I don't think that's it."

[Taichi]
"In a part you can't see."

In a part I can't show.
Touko held her head.

[Touko]
"......I...can't take this place...anymore......"
[Touko]
"I'm scared......of this Institute......I want to return to......"

Where do you want to return to?
I'm sure she doesn't mean her old school.
Back to days that have long since passed.

[Taichi]
"I said it's fine. It's fun once you get used to it."

[Touko]
"I can't get used to it."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you just deciding that you can't?"
[Taichi]
"Kirihara's cute, so if she wanted to she could have as fun a life as she wanted."

[Touko]
"Th-that's not what we're talking about."

[Taichi]
"Cute, cute."

I rubbed her head.

[Touko]
"......stop that! You idiot!"

She threw me off.
But if she really didn't like it, would she be red all the way up to her ears?

[Taichi]
"......nn......"

And then, I had a dream about Touko---

[Taichi]
"......"

I woke up.
Sunlight was penetrating through the window.
I must have been sleeping soundly. I didn't have a single dream.
The time......7 A.M.
I have to go to school.
I looked inside the classroom.
Touko was there.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Touko]
"......(hmph)"

[Taichi]
"You don't look well."

[Touko]
"......that has nothing to do with you, Kurosu."

That's curt.

[Taichi]
"Why are you coming to school?"

[Touko]
"That also has nothing to do with you."

[Taichi]
"I know."
[Taichi]
"It's because you want someone to talk to you."

[Touko]
"......that's not it!"

Her voice became rough.

[Taichi]
"That's why I spoke to you."

[Touko]
"What are you......isn't that just something Kurosu thought up on his own!?"

[Taichi]
"This makes it two days in a row. If you just drink water, you'll die."
[Taichi]
"I'll give you this."

I held out Youko's bentou.

[Touko]
"What, is this?"

[Taichi]
"It's definitely not underwear or a bottle of wonderful lives."

[Touko]
"......I can't trust that at all."
[Touko]
"You never think about anything but semen."

[Taichi]
"That's a ridiculous overstatement."

I was shocked.
//You were? 〜IX

[Taichi]
"It's food!"
[Taichi]
"There's sandwiches and sweet bean bread in it."
//Various English purality conventions clash here, and I'm not quite sure what to do about it. 〜IX
[Taichi]
"......the sweet bean bread was even steamed in a basket."

[Touko]
"I don't need this......I don't."

[Taichi]
"No, you need it. Eat."

*nudge*
I poked her with the bread.

[Touko]
"......stop that."

She threw me off her violently.
The bread fell.
I picked it up.
I ignored the parts that had picked up dirt and ate it myself.
Then I held out another one.

[Touko]
"You......"

The secret technique of becoming the pupil of your parents' murderer.
//Not a clue O.o - Sheeta
//Me neither.-Spin
Touko should fall for it easily.

[Taichi]
"Take it."

[Touko]
"......a......"

She accepted it.
With the bread in her hands, she gazed at me agape.

[Taichi]
"Isn't it painful to have no one besides yourself to worry about you?"

[Touko]
"I don't understand what you're saying."

[Taichi]
"You want people to worry about you."
[Taichi]
"You want them to complete you."

[Touko]
"......"

She became quiet.

[Taichi]
"And I, for one, do worry a little."

She surely despises me.

[Touko]
"You sure can talk."
[Touko]
"If you're really worried about me, then why, why!?"

She suddenly stood up.

[Taichi]
"Ah, I wasn't trying to make you mad or anything."

*smack*
I toppled.
It didn't hurt at all.

[Touko]
"......uuuu......"

After attacking me, Touko collapsed.

[Taichi]
"Hello?"

[Touko]
"......nn............"

She was rubbing her eyes. Her face looked pale.

[Taichi]
"......Touko."

I stooped down beside her.

[Touko]
"Don't say my name without an honorific......"

She seemed to be straining her voice.

[Taichi]
"This is an emergency. Let's call a truce."

[Touko]
"I can't see......"

[Taichi]
"You're fine. Your blood flow is just bad right now."

[Touko]
"I feel drained......like I'm gonna hurl."

[Taichi]
"You need to puke?"

[Touko]
"......yeah."

[Taichi]
"Then lie on your side."

I rested her head in my lap.

[Touko]
"Nn......my head...is spinning......like I stood up too fast......"

[Taichi]
"You'll be able to see again soon."

[Touko]
"How do you know that? You don't know any doctors."

[Taichi]
"I know all about Touko."

[Touko]
"Ah......"

[Taichi]
"Can you see now?"

[Touko]
"......yeah."

[Taichi]
"Anemia. That sort of thing can happen sometimes."

[Touko]
"It's gotten......a bit better......"

[Taichi]
"Open your mouth."

[Touko]
"You'll put something weird in it, so no."

[Taichi]
"Just water. Pure water."
[Taichi]
"I'm just going to make you drink it."

[Touko]
"......"

She opened her mouth.
I poured it in.

[Touko]
"Wapu!!?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry."

[Touko]
"Forget it, I'll drink on my own! Give me that!"
[Touko]
"Nn! Nn! Nn!......"

Touko drained it with the manners of a sports club's vice president who never stops worrying about her teammates.
Was her stomach being stimulated?
Kuu...

[Touko]
"......that was......a mistake."

[Taichi]
"I know."
[Taichi]
"And that's why you should eat."

[Touko]
"............"

She blushed easily.
A while after Touko finished eating lunch,

[Touko]
"......I'll line up today."

She said that.
She'd gotten used to the cafeteria.
But Touko always hid behind my back.
Because there were many strange people.
I even escorted her to the bathroom.
Touko's job was taking attendance.
But even that she did half scared.

[Taichi]
"By 'line up' you mean......on your own?"

[Touko]
"......I'm always making you line up for me...... so today I'll do it."

She headed to the counter, meal ticket in hand.

[Taichi]
"My, my......"

[Touko]
"......it's too fluffy."

[Taichi]
"They were made this morning."

[Touko]
"It's too big to eat easily."

[Taichi]
"They were made for me."

[Touko]
"There's too much mustard."

[Taichi]
"I like them bitter."

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"So, is it bad?"

[Touko]
"............it's good."

[Taichi]
"Then take your time eating it."

[Touko]
*sniff*

She was sniffling.

[Taichi]
"Take your time, so your stomach won't reject it."
[Taichi]
"I have another piece of bread, do you need it?"
//Is it still obvious that "bread" = "sweet bean bread"? Because I'd really like to not write that all out any more than I have to. 〜IX
//Yeah, I think it is - Sheeta
//Double affirmation, plus, who cares. -Neko

[Touko]
"......I do."

[Taichi]
"The servants in your house prepared all your meals, right?"

[Touko]
"......yes."

[Taichi]
"What happens when they're gone?"

[Touko]
"Nothing happens. There's just no food."

[Taichi]
"Since Touko can't cook, I guess that would equal death."

[Touko]
"......why......do you know...I can't cook......?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about that."

[Touko]
"That bothers me......"

[Taichi]
"How do you feel?"

[Touko]
"It's gotten better......a little."

[Taichi]
"If you get hungry, come to my place."
[Taichi]
"I don't have any caviar, but there are plenty of potatoes."

[Touko]
"............but..."

I know what she wants to say.
She fears betrayal.

[Taichi]
"......more importantly,"
[Taichi]
"How do you think humanity was destroyed?"

She looked out the window.
I didn't expect to get anything out of asking her.

[Touko]
"They weren't destroyed."
[Touko]
"......no one was ever here."
//Eh? Why don't I remember this!? I must've ctrled too much... ;_; 〜IX
[Touko]
"Thinking that doesn't irritate me."
[Touko]
"Nor does it discourage me."

[Taichi]
"For the same reason you ignored me?"

I turned to face her.
Touko averted her line of sight.

[Touko]
"......that's right."
[Touko]
"And yet, you came and talked to me......that's not right...and you knew it all along!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

[Touko]
"Why are you apologizing!?"
[Touko]
"I can't understand you at all......Taichi......"

Silent weeping.
Time passed.
I brought potatoes to the garden.
With survival manga as my guide, I prepared the rice cooker.

[Taichi]
"Finished......"

Steaming them is a pain, so I just cooked them.
A double serving of potatoes.
I waited.
A person collapsed at my front door.
It was Kirihara Touko.

[Touko]
"Uuuuuu."

[Taichi]
"......"

I carried Touko on my shoulders.

[Touko]
"......Ta-Taichi......?"

I brought her with me.

[Touko]
"Ah, aau......"

I sat her down.
I put a potato in her mouth.

[Touko]
"Uuuuu! Umumumumumumu!!?"
[Touko]
"I can eat it myself!!!"

She screamed while spitting out potato scraps.
*gobble* *gobble* *gobble*

[Taichi]
"Here's the salt."

[Touko]
"Put it on."

[Taichi]
"......very well."

Touko ate with all her strength.

[Touko]
"......nku!"

Her limbs tightened.
Just as planned (not that I planned it).
//Short of Romeo being a time traveller, we can assume this isn't a DeathNote reference, but it sorta becomes one ex post facto, so if anyone knows a slightly more well-recognized English phrasing for this line, go right ahead. 〜IX
//This is fine, and doesn't need to be changed. The above wouldn't worked because it's going all according to plan, not necessarily his plan. -Neko

[Taichi]
"Here, water."

I passed her a PET bottle.

[Touko]
"Nn! Nn! Nn!......"

She gulped it down.

[Touko]
"Hafu, hafu."

She devoured again.
After flattening seven or eight of them, Touko finally took a breath.

[Touko]
"......I've calmed down."

[Taichi]
"That's good to hear."

Touko corrected her sitting posture.

[Touko]
"......and eaten enough."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Touko]
"Also......th-thank you."

It was awkward.

[Taichi]
"That aside, please look at this."

[Touko]
"What is this?"

[Taichi]
"It's called canned food."

[Touko]
"Hmmm."

[Taichi]
"You open it, and there's food inside. Moist preservatives, to be precise."

[Touko]
"......aaah, I get it."
[Touko]
"Where is it sold?"

[Taichi]
"Convenience stores and the like."

[Touko]
"Conveni......?"

[Taichi]
"You don't even know about convenience stores!?"

[Touko]
"I-I know about them......it's just that I've never done anything more than look at them."

[Taichi]
"I'm cumming!!"

I climaxed.
And fell over.

[Touko]
"Kyaa!!? Wh-what happened?"

[Taichi]
"Your richness is over ninety-eight percent."

[Touko]
"Eh?......Am I?......I don't know......?"
[Touko]
"Besides, even if you bring up money now......"

[Taichi]
"Well, that's true."
[Taichi]
"Aaah, I should've become a son-in-law in that household when I had the chance."

I was angry.

[Touko]
"......with such an impure motive......"

[Taichi]
"Not just me. You were trying to stealthily introduce me to your parents."

[Touko]
"......I did do that......but Taichi ran away."

[Taichi]
"You know, Touko..."
[Taichi]
"I'm Gunjou Institute's Most Wanted."
[Taichi]
"If you introduced such a person to them......there's no way your godfather would accept that, right?"

[Touko]
"......Taichi's not strange."

[Taichi]
"If you can say that, there's still a long way to go."
[Taichi]
"Before you lose your Mongolian spot."
//I'm leaving this one to be wikied. 〜IX

[Touko]
"You said that once before."
[Touko]
"But you don't make any sense to me......since I'm an idiot......"
[Touko]
"If you'd just be kind, that's all I need......"

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

[Touko]
"......this is a pain. To think that you have to work just to stay alive."

[Taichi]
"Kirihara can't live on her own."

[Touko]
"......-hut up."

[Taichi]
"You automatic girl......"

[Touko]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Touko]
"......can I live here?"

[Taichi]
"Sure."

[Touko]
"......okay......eh, eh? It's...okay?"

[Taichi]
"Sure."

[Touko]
"Ah, umm, I'll bring a change of clothes right away!"

[Taichi]
"I've got fabric scissors, so you don't have to bring those."

[Touko]
"......nngaguku!!?"

She came right back.
Her bag was bulging with belongings.
Her knees were bent, and she was sweating.
I remembered a time when I mocked her by saying she'd never carried anything heavier than chopsticks.
Then, with a serious face, she retorted that she used a knife and fork.

[Taichi]
"You overdid it."

[Touko]
"Th-there's too much to carry by myself---"

She opened her eyes wide and made vigorous gestures as she explained.
This side of her was really cute.

[Taichi]
"Let's use a car tomorrow."

[Touko]
"You have a license?"

[Taichi]
"Do I need one?"

[Touko]
"Ah, that's right......"
[Touko]
"For now, I brought a minimal change of clothes, so I'll be staying here starting tonight."

[Taichi]
"Would you mind sharing my room?"

[Touko]
"I'd prefer it that way......"

[Taichi]
"It's small, so don't complain."

[Touko]
"......I prefer small......because I can stay near you......"

[Taichi]
"Eh......?"

[Touko]
"N-nothing......"

Touko looked the other way as her nose turned red (I can't tell in this darkness, but it probably did).
Damn coquetting.
I'll deal with this calmly using adult charms.

[Taichi]
"N-n-n-n-now, s-s-s-s-since we have nothing to do, let's s-s-s-s-s-s-s-sleep."

Uwaaan!
No good, calm down, me.

[Touko]
"Uh, umm......"

[Taichi]
"Nn? Yes? What?"

[Touko]
"I want to take a bath."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, there is overnight water left in there......if you don't mind pouring it over yourself."
//Last time, he told her about a neighbor's house or something that had the water.-Spin

There wasn't much of it, but with only one week, it's just fine for the pace we'll be living at.

[Touko]
"That's fine, I'll use that."

[Taichi]
"......okay."

I sat in a seiza position on top of my bed and thought.
Not good.
She's really into it.
Easy to understand.
So simple it's just too cute.
A flat, ungarnished heart.
She can do such things......because she's so pure.
This is hard.
What should I do?
......that's the only answer, isn't it?
Yes.
For Touko to remain Touko,
Shouldn't I live with her for that reason?
But......I do want......at least a little.
Could I attain something healthy?
That's what these days are: a holy battle.

[Touko]
"Taichi......"

She returned.

[Taichi]
"Touko......"

[Touko]
"......I'm all clean now......"

I felt like I'd embrace her the moment I stood up.
Fast. And fragile.
A long time ago, there was a famously stupid couple living near us that broke up and clung to each other all the time.
Even though they argued enough for their angry voices to reach the neighbors, they'd untangle everything in no time.
......I never imagined I might become like that.
And now Touko is saying something as embarrassing as 『I'm all clean now』 right in front of me.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's right."

I showed her the best smile.

[Taichi]
"Then...here."

I handed her a sleeping bag.

[Touko]
"........................what's this cylinder?"

As a bag for sleeping purposes that had been rolled up, it was indeed cylindrical.

[Taichi]
"You probably don't know, but this is called a sleeping bag. It's a bag for sleeping in."

Question marks danced above Touko's head.

[Touko]
"How do I get in the bag to sleep?"

[Taichi]
"Because women aren't just bags for men."
//Probably referencing a past argument of theirs which required a tl note for some famous Japanese feminist advocate. But I have no idea how to make it sound natural in English. 〜IX
//......I have no idea either O.o - Sheeta

[Touko]
"......this is hard...I don't quite get it."

How could you?

[Taichi]
"If you use this then the floor won't hurt as much. There you go, Touko!"
//It hurts anyway regardless of sleeping bag, I'm afraid - Sheeta

[Touko]
"Isn't there a bed right there......?"

[Taichi]
"This is mine."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"......"

We cut into each others' faces with our glares.

[Touko]
"Your incomprehensibility just rose......"

[Taichi]
"I said I'd let you stay over, but I didn't promise anything else."
[Taichi]
"So good night."

I sunk my body into the soft bed.
It's dark, and there's nothing to do besides sleep.

[Touko]
"Eh!? Wait......we still haven't......done...any..."

[Taichi]
*snore*

[Touko]
"H-how could......"

[Taichi]
*snore*

[Touko]
"Idiot-idiot-idiot! Taichi you idiot."

[Taichi]
*snore*

*rustle* *rustle*
The sound of a sleeping bag being rolled out.
The sound of a body sliding inside.

[Touko]
"Uuuuu......the floor...hurts......"

Dissatisfied malcontent.

[Touko]
"............"
[Touko]
"Too hot!! I can't sleep in something like this in the summer!"
[Touko]
"Forget it, I'll sleep directly on the floor......"
[Touko]
"......*sob*......it's haaard...it huuurts......"

She continued weeping quietly until she fell asleep.

[Taichi]
"......you are noisy......"

Until Touko fell asleep, I couldn't sleep.
Even so,
I stretched out my hand and softly wiped the corners of her eyes.
When I woke up, Touko was sleeping on the floor.
An expression of agony.

[Touko]
"......uuu......"

I felt sorry for her.
Maybe she had a bad dream or something.
Anyway, I got changed and headed for school.
A gate to prevent running away.
It didn't seem to be protecting the students so much as protecting the outside world from us.
That's the impression it held.
Like a gangster from a previous era, I sat down in my chair and crossed my legs on top of my desk.
My chair leaned back and forth.
There's nothing to do. Absolutely nothing.

[Touko]
"Taichi......"

Touko came, rather late.
She was out of breath.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're late."

[Touko]
"......I searched for you......everywhere......"

[Taichi]
"I see, so that's why you're late."
[Taichi]
"Laaate, laaate!"

I mocked her, and her expression turned to anger.
No, it'd probably have done that even if I hadn't.

[Touko]
"Why did you go by yourself!? Why didn't you wake me up!?"

[Taichi]
"Because you were sleeping."

[Touko]
"Wake me up!"

[Taichi]
"......(thought)"
[Taichi]
"Sorry, I wasn't being considerate enough."

Touko fell to her knees.

[Touko]
"......I feel......like crying......"

[Taichi]
"You're such a crybaby."
[Taichi]
"More importantly, let's go and collect some food and eat it. I'm hungry."

[Touko]
"......haaa......"

We searched for various types of food after that.
In nearby residences and stores.
Seeking provisions.
Touko looked sad the whole time.
Since we avoided living things, all we had were packaged and dried foods.
I also spent a lot of time explaining every last detail of instant food to Touko.
Even so, by the time we were eating our cheap meal, we felt better.

[Touko]
"......Kurosu...a lot of your friends are girls."

[Taichi]
"Ha? What's your point?"

[Touko]
"Today, I passed by the club room and saw everyone making a commotion."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that happens."

[Touko]
"You're popular."

We were just making noise as usual.

[Taichi]
"......why are you getting bent out of shape?"

[Touko]
"I'm not bending!"

She got mad.

[Taichi]
"They are club members, so calling them my friends is a bit......weren't there guys there too?"

[Touko]
"I didn't see them......"

[Taichi]
"There should've been a few. Still, if I really was popular with the ladies, don't you think I'd have at least one girlfriend?"

[Touko]
"Yeah...you don't......"

[Taichi]
"If I did, I wouldn't talk to Kirihara like this."

[Touko]
"........................eh?"

My invasion was steadily progressing.
I spent the afternoon in the club room.
The breeze was nice, so it was more refreshing than the classroom.

[Taichi]
"This brings back memories."

[Touko]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"Of how hard it was to get you to come and visit the club room."

[Touko]
"............"

She started coming to club activities once in a while.

[Taichi]
"......yo, there you are."

[Touko]
"I just happened to be bored."

[Taichi]
"So Kirihara comes when no one else is here."

[Touko]
"......that's a coincidence."

[Taichi]
"Well, sit. I'll bring out the cheap coffee."

[Touko]
"......okay."

........................
It was an experiment.
How far could a human like me go in the normal world by acting sociable?
How much could I deceive them?
Based on the results, I might decide how I'll live.
Could I blend in?
By imitating the pity form called a 'bond?'
Is life possible?
To do that, one needs a certain degree of power to control people's wills.
Because I'm an oddity.
I can't not be feared.
My foulness can't not be of concern.
The ugliness at my foundation directly connected to the image of a witch.
The cause......probably some story I heard when I was a kid.
From what I read in books, witch hunting has historically been quite severe, and that might be due to the idea that 『Witches really are evil people.』
I could imagine white hair holding magical properties.
Same goes for the sparkles in these eyes.
There's no limit of things to worry about.

[Taichi]
"Here's yours, Touko."

I handed her a cup of coffee.
It might be cheap, but there's still a certain trick to getting Blue Mountain Tea to come out right.

[Touko]
"......hey."

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Touko]
"I'll call you Taichi."

I was a little surprised.
That was the first time I'd felt Touko deviate from my understanding of her.

[Taichi]
"......sure, but that's a bit sudden."

[Touko]
"But you keep calling me 'Touko, Touko.' That's unfair."
[Touko]
"So this is payback."

She smiled brightly.

[Taichi]
"......feel free to."

I tried forcing a smile.
........................

[Taichi]
"What's this?"

[Touko]
"......I-I made......a bentou."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, you were able to make something this plebeian."
//Since "commoner-ish/like/esque" just won't sound right here, I fell back on a semi-obscure synonym. 〜IX
//This is a 6th grade vocab word, so it's fine and shouldn't be changed. -Neko

[Touko]
"Of course. I happen to be good at cooking."

[Taichi]
"Isn't there a bit too much in here?"

[Touko]
"......that's true......I made too much......so, Taichi, you have special permission to partake."

[Taichi]
"Ah, I see......"

I'd had enough of that.

[Touko]
"......is it good?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, it's truly delicious."

[Touko]
"H-how is......that omelette?"

[Taichi]
"Somehow, this one seems strangely off......even though everything else is fine..."

[Touko]
"Uu......"

I see.
I sensed the truth from her reaction and chose an appropriate action.
//Damn accidental rhymes looking like I put them in intentionally. 〜IX
//Could use 'an appropriate response' just to be safe. It wouldn't be wrong. Added 'an' to make this grammatically correct none the less. -Neko

[Taichi]
"Nn......aaah, but this one's the best of all."

[Touko]
"Really!?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. It really is delicious."
[Taichi]
"Somehow, it feels like it has feelings put into it. Yes, tasty, tasty."

Actually, it was the worst.
Just as it looked.
I politely repeated those days.
........................
Half a day passed by.
Casual time.
Unaltruistic time.
//Wow, I never get to tl this word literally. 〜IX
Is that what 'priceless' means?
No.
Someday I'll think back on the time I spent fooling around with Touko in this school.

[Touko]
"Hey, come home with me......didn't you promise?"

She said that when I started walking down the stairs to go home.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, it's fine, it's fine."

The car had a spot on it.

[Taichi]
"Kukuku."

Today, I shall take the principal's Ferrari.
I swiped the key from the principal's office.
It's true that I have no driving skill.
But, in place of that I can make an overabundance of effort.
Through the days of this ever repeating week, I've touched cars countless times and mastered them.
Those skills were now formulaic (?) indeed.
//Might be a reference to F1. 〜IX
//I agree - Sheeta
*vroom* *vroom* *vroom!*

[Taichi]
"Now, let's go."

[Touko]
"You're like a race car driver, hu."

She got into the passenger seat.

[Taichi]
"Please fasten your seat belt."

[Touko]
"......okay...there we go......"

[Taichi]
"Then we're off!"

........................

[Touko]
"......from now on......I'm not driving with Taichi......"

[Taichi]
"Agreed."

It didn't really go that well.
Once again, I'd badly damaged the Ferrari.

[Taichi]
"That thing's hard to drive. It shakes right away when I turn the wheel, and the clutch is so heavy I can't change gears......on top of that when I decelerate and shift down it lurches......is it a defective vehicle?"

Do I......have no skill whatsoever?
For now we had no choice but to throw it away after use.
We headed to Touko's mansion.
........................

[Touko]
"I was wondering, 'What should I bring?' and searched all over the place."
[Touko]
"And I found these old pictures."

She said happily.

[Touko]
"Good thing we didn't throw them away......I think I'll put them up on a wall."
[Touko]
"There are enough to completely cover one."

[Taichi]
"Ooohhh."

[Touko]
"Huhu!"

She folded her arms around mine.
I took an item out of my tool bag and equipped it.

[Taichi]
"Look at this, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"An armband?"

The noblewoman strained her eyes.

[Touko]
"......I oppose......stupid couples......"
[Touko]
"I oppose stupid couples."

Touko deciphered the words.

[Taichi]
"That's right. From my position, I see the grave influence that stupid couples exert on their surroundings, and make every effort to control their firmly unregulated attitude."
[Taichi]
"Unfold your arms."

I shook her off.

[Touko]
"Not that this is unusual......but I don't understand what you're saying."

[Taichi]
"Refrain from public displays of senseless affection."

[Touko]
"But...there aren't any people......"

[Taichi]
"There are a few."

[Touko]
"Uuu."

She was unsatisfied.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, you're good as a reverse competitive girl."

[Touko]
"Haa?"

[Taichi]
"But you're going way too far with the sweetness! You have too much juice! Go on with a more thoroughly competitive spirit! Carefully select times to be embarrassed. That's far more moe......and it's for your sake as well, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"Ha? Haa......"

[Taichi]
"You're the sort of girl who's like a precious jewel."

[Touko]
"Eh?! (heartbeat)"

[Taichi]
"That sparkle surpasses the diamond......yet it is sad, for diamonds are carbon to be burned up in flames. Goddamn! I fully understand how foolish it is to hold one's hard-earned wealth in diamonds."

[Touko]
"???"

[Taichi]
"You have good and bad points. Please understand that, my wonderful maiden."

[Touko]
"I don't really understand...but I get it."

[Taichi]
"So now you know?"

[Touko]
"......Taichi, it's embarrassing to be clingy in front of people."

[Taichi]
"Ei!"

I lowered her panties.

[Touko]
"Fugiii!"

[Taichi]
"Fugiii."

On the way home we used the Kiriharas' RV.
And got in an accident on the way.
Only a few hundred meters away from my house.
Fortunately, I already had a key to one of the cars parked nearby.

[Touko]
"......somehow......you're well-prepared......"

[Taichi]
"This isn't what I'd planned."
[Taichi]
"Aaah!! I'm exhausted!!"

[Touko]
"......thank you for doing all that."

[Taichi]
"No problem."

[Touko]
"Can we take a bath together?"

[Taichi]
"If there's no sex."

[Touko]
"......"

She was expressionless, but what sort of emotions were swirling underneath...?

[Touko]
"I'll go in first."

[Taichi]
"Seeee youuu laaater."

Now then,
I searched her belongings.
Harakiri Blade discovered.
I went out to the garden.
I broke it.
In its place I put a carnation.
Flowers are a symbol of peace after all.

[Touko]
"......refreshing..."

[Taichi]
"Yep, you're refreshed."

[Touko]
"I feel incredibly clean right now, but......hey?"

[Taichi]
"Here it comes."

A straighter approach than yesterday.
That's why people with stupid couple skills......

[Touko]
"Hey...you really can't hold it in any longer, right? Taichi, you're perverted after all."

[Taichi]
"I just happened to become impotent."

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Impotence is a German word. Weren't we taught that? 'Impo' is too direct, so why not shorten it to 'poten?'"

[Touko]
"........................"
[Touko]
"Do you hate me?"

[Taichi]
"I love you to pieces."

[Touko]
"Then why!?"

[Taichi]
"Because I love you."

[Touko]
"???"

By which I mean, putting my hands on you won't accomplish anything anyway.
There's a need to continue holding myself back.

[Touko]
"......fine. I'll wash and go to bed."
//I haven't seen this usage of "wash up" in forever, so please tell me if I got it right. Actually, even if I did, please suggest other ways to say it. There might be one that works better with the gag five lines below. 〜IX
//I got rid of the 'up' part. Hopefully it works better now - Sheeta

Wash? Does that involve her skin?
My interest was pulled.

[Taichi]
"That side of you truly is a girl!"
[Taichi]
"Take care of your girlishness---"

She was washing her sword.
//I thought she is going to wash her sword - Raide

[Taichi]
"......or not."

[Touko]
"Now,"

My deep and silent denouncement hadn't reached her.
*slide*
Her favorite blade peeked out from the scabbard.
A carnation.

[Touko]
"My soul---------!!??"

*shake* *shake* *shake* *shake!!!*
She convulsed.

[Touko]
"Aau, aau, aau, aau!!!"

Something came out of her mouth.
*Something = Ectoplasm

[Taichi]
"Not good!"

[Touko]
"Nnnnnnnnnnnnn!!?"

She pushed it back in.
//Not really sure about this one. 〜IX

[Touko]
"......haa, haa, haa."

She came back to her senses.

[Touko]
"Hey, what's the meaning of this!!?"

[Taichi]
"Possession of bladed weapons is prohibited, you idiot!!"

[Touko]
"Aren't you the idiot! Didn't you know that this blade is a part of my soul, you ruffian!!?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, I did it knowingly."

I spat out.

[Taichi]
"You need no weapon!"

[Touko]
"Uu......uuuuu......my sword......"

[Taichi]
"Make sure you don't get a new one."

Touko slept timidly.
But,
But---

[Touko]
"Hey......I want to visit Taichi's house."

[Taichi]
"Fine by me."

[Touko]
"......what about your family?"

[Taichi]
"My mother lives in an apartment near her job and only comes home once in a while."
//I'm assuming 'she' = his mother. If I'm wrong, please revert it ^^ - Sheeta
//Having 'she' here would be redundant since the subject is identified. Leave Sheeta's correction. -Neko
[Taichi]
"I'm pretty much alone."

[Touko]
"......oh...I see......then, maybe I'll come over."

The time had come.
For evidence.
........................

[Touko]
"Taichi......it's...my first time......so......be gentle......"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I know."

[Touko]
"......I......love you......"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I know---"

Because I induced you to.
With the conviction that I could do well in the world.
I embraced Touko, along with relief.

[Touko]
"......ah......aaaaah!......"

The experiment was a success.
That's what I thought.
I'd forgotten.
That both Touko and I held uncontrollable selves.
Guiding us to break down with the epitome of decadence.

[Taichi]
"......how do you usually do it with yourself?"

[Touko]
"Eh?......I don't......"

[Taichi]
"You do. Touko does do it. I know."

[Touko]
"I don't do that......"

[Taichi]
"Show me, using my fingers."

[Touko]
"Sh-show you what?"

[Taichi]
"Masturbation. Show me what you look like when you cum."

[Touko]
"............o-okay......"
[Touko]
"Like this......nn......Taichi's fingers...they're long......"

........................

[Touko]
"Today......what should I do?"

[Taichi]
"Good question. First, squeeze it with your hands."

[Touko]
"......nn."

[Taichi]
"How is it?"

[Touko]
"Hot......"

[Taichi]
"Because the blood's gathering there."
[Taichi]
"You can do it rougher."

[Touko]
"......ah......aaah......"

[Taichi]
"Hold it like this, and your grip strength---"

I taught her every little thing.
I wanted to defile her.
Because a girl's shame stimulates my instincts.
I wanted to see it directly.
That's why I carved into her.

[Taichi]
"......I'm going to cum. Hold out your palm."

[Touko]
"......eh? Like this?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Touko]
"Kya......no......it's......a lot of it...is coming out......"

[Taichi]
"Try licking it."

[Touko]
"......licking this?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

........................

[Touko]
"Aan, aaah!......Aaaaah!......Nnah!......No, someone might come!......"

[Taichi]
"I don't care."

[Touko]
"Uuuu!......Ah! Aaaah......kyan!"
[Touko]
"......ah! Nn! Taichi......Taichiii......"

........................
The change came suddenly.

[Touko]
"......stop talking to Miyasumi-sempai."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

I narrowed my eyes and conjectured.

[Taichi]
"We're not doing anything we shouldn't be."

[Touko]
"I don't like it. Stop it. And stay near me."

[Taichi]
"......aren't I near you right now?"

[Touko]
"More......"

[Taichi]
"More......?"
[Taichi]
"In the first place, I'm in the club so conversations with Sempai are......"

[Touko]
"Drop the club."

[Taichi]
"You're being unreasonable."

[Touko]
"Miyasumi-sempai...she's in the way......"

[Taichi]
"Touko?"

Dangerous.

[Touko]
"Maybe she should just go away."

That's dangerous.

[Taichi]
"Hey, keep it together."

[Touko]
"......eh?"

She came back to her senses.

[Taichi]
"Maintain yourself properly. You felt weird just now."

[Touko]
"Aaah, I'm sorry......"
[Touko]
"Huhu......hey, is there anything else you want to do?"

That was the beginning of an inclination.
A fun walk to school.
And yet,
Touko was sullen the whole way there.

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"......hmph."

She'd put up a barrier.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

She'd been this way all morning.

[Taichi]
"Heeey."

[Touko]
"......"

It's hopeless.
Touko rushed ahead of me.
I closed in on her.
And lined up next to her.
The proud and haughty Touko didn't look at me at all.
I extended one hand and tried gripping her breast.

[Touko]
"Ii!?"

[Taichi]
"You don't have any boobs at all!"

[Touko]
"Sileeeeence!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ojou-samaaaaaa!!!"

The gate had been left open.
As if waiting to let me inside.
I used to think of this place as a prison.
But right now, it was a reassuring place, like a womb.
There aren't any people.
None, nowhere.
Only at school, only at Gunjou Institute, could we naturally gather together and see one another.
We were pulled in and made to carry on the past.
Actually, this annihilation of humanity is quite harsh.
I think it was the final straw for most humans.
It was good news for me, but for them it was a disheartening and lax death.
And Touko had no choice but to come to my house.
It's ironic.
Sure enough, Touko was right there.

[Taichi]
"You got here fast."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"And yet you're in casual wear again?"
[Taichi]
"I'm impressed you can wear something so warm."

Ignore.

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey."

I shrugged my shoulders and sat down in my seat......right next to Touko's.
I stared at her profile.
She appeared to take no notice of me, but I knew she was paying attention to me.

[Taichi]
"Sorry about last night."

[Touko]
"......you're not reflecting on it at all......"

[Taichi]
"Weeell..."

[Touko]
"......Taichi's always like that."
[Touko]
"As if you can't even see me."
[Touko]
"Always running off......acting on your own."

[Taichi]
"You're right. I'm reflecting on that."

[Touko]
"I just want you to care about me a little more."

[Taichi]
"I thought you'd say that......so I came prepared."

[Touko]
"Prepared?"

Croquette bread landed on the top of Touko's desk.

[Taichi]
"Now, satisfy your hunger!"

[Touko]
"That's not it!!"

*growlll*...
However, Touko's stomach growled.

[Touko]
"Hafu!!?"

[Taichi]
"Your stomach bug."

[Touko]
"Th-this is different!"

*growl* *growlll*...
Her stomach bug.

[Taichi]
"Your stomach bug again."

[Touko]
"I'm telling you this is a different issue!"

[Taichi]
"There's no point in hiding it. I can talk to stomach bugs, you know?"

[Touko]
"............uh, what?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, you're hungry."
[Taichi]
"And so am I, by the way."
[Taichi]
"So, our first period class will be croquette bread."

I tore open a package and dug into the first one.
Thankfully, they hadn't spoiled.

[Taichi]
"And this will also be our time to make up."
[Taichi]
"......I guess that'd be ethics."

Touko was amazed.

[Touko]
"......hey, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Nnmu?"

[Touko]
"......Taichi...do you need me?"

[Taichi]
"Of course I do."

[Touko]
"......then......why won't you touch me?"
[Touko]
"It's not like......but I already said I don't want you to......isn't that part of living together?"

[Taichi]
"......I don't want to degenerate."

I bit into the bread.

[Taichi]
"I don't want to let go of my tense rationality."

[Touko]
"......rationality......"

[Taichi]
"Do you have the confidence to maintain yourself?"

Within this situation.

[Touko]
"......I don't have to maintain myself."

[Taichi]
"You haven't forgotten what you did back then, right?"

[Touko]
"That was Taichi's......"

[Taichi]
"Regardless of whatever I did, that wasn't something you'd normally do."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I do love you Touko."

[Touko]
"Then......"

[Taichi]
"But I love the normal Touko."
[Taichi]
"The Touko that fights the world with her cold shoulder."
//Always fun to adapt these usages of "tsun" 〜IX
[Taichi]
"And I'm not an escape route for Touko."
[Taichi]
"Which is why that can't be love."

Even if I don't really mind,
Touko will eventually have to live on her own.
That's why she needs the strength to fight.

[Touko]
"That's why......I waved......"

[Taichi]
"Well..."
[Taichi]
"I'm not good at depending on people or being depended on by people."
[Taichi]
"That's why I don't want Touko to drown."
[Taichi]
"But because I love you, I'll help make sure you can't break."
[Taichi]
"That's how simple this really is."

[Touko]
"............"

She silently chewed her bread.

[Touko]
......*sob*

She was moved to tears.

[Touko]
"*hic*......uku!......Uu, uuuuuuu......"

In order to grow her wings...
//imo, the metaphor works in English, but I'm not sure if that's just me thinking too Japanesey again. 〜IX
I went to the bathroom.

[Taichi]
*sigh*

[Youko]
"......Taichi."

There she is.

[Youko]
"I oppose stupid couples."
//How in god's name do I not remember a line this awesome? I really was overzealous with ctrl... 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Eh......?"

[Youko]
"I oppose stupid couples too. Just like Taichi."

[Taichi]
"......ah, I see."

She looked expressionless, but there was resolve in her eyes.

[Taichi]
"I understand what you're trying to say."
[Taichi]
"So, was that all you came here for?"

[Youko]
"......yes."

[Taichi]
"Still......"

What about you?

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan."

[Youko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"I love you. Can I have a kiss?"

[Youko]
"......Taichi!"

She came and embraced me like a sticky snake.
Iron Claw.

[Taichi]
"Have a taste of your own medicine."
//Yay convenient English idiom. This has happened maybe three times in the entire tl, so each instance is rather cool from my perspective. 〜IX

[Youko]
"Aaaaah......ow......that hurts......this......I'm sorry, sor-!......"

[Touko]
"............haa."

How many times has she done that?
I sighed heavily.
My stomach was getting heavy just by sitting next to her.

[Taichi]
"Hey, let's go to the beach."

[Touko]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"Just the two of us, tomorrow."

[Touko]
"......but......Taichi, you don't want to go with me, right......?"

It was a mystery how her aura of ignorance could turn into this within a single bound.

[Taichi]
"I do want to."

I showed her a smile.

[Taichi]
"As long as a perky Touko will come with me."

[Touko]
"......perky......"
[Touko]
"Taichi says difficult things......"

[Taichi]
"Love is a complex thing."

I said something apt with Oscar-class acting.

[Touko]
"Then I need to ask......do you love me?"

[Taichi]
"I do indeed!"

I radiated a million-dollar smile with blinding white teeth.

[Touko]
"Haaa."

A charmed noblewoman.

[Touko]
"I don't really understand......but whatever."
[Touko]
"You said you loved me, after all."

She said vacantly.

[Taichi]
"You're too simple."

The whisper I threw in the opposite direction of Touko disappeared behind the trees.

[Touko]
"......I've fallen in love with a weird man."

Touko stretched, and seemed to be having a bit of fun.
She really is whimsical.

[Taichi]
"Friday, huh?"

Three days left until the world swings back.
Today as well, I'll do what I should do.

[Taichi]
"Even so......"

I looked at the floor.
Touko was asleep.
At night she's been moaning 'It hurts, it hurts,' but it looks like she'd finally gotten used to it.
She was sleeping soundly.
Today I'll be going to the beach with this girl.
Since the beach gives a great mood.
There are a lot of things I have to be careful of.
I don't have the confidence to control myself if I end up doing something erotic.

[Taichi]
"I'll do my best."

When I persistently evade touching her bare skin, we get into an argument.
Touko shrank back and went somewhere on her own.

[Taichi]
"......I'm not letting that happen again."

That...
Following the inclination---
........................

[Taichi]
"What's this about, Touko?"

I closed in on Touko.

[Taichi]
"In front of everyone......I never thought you'd do such a thing..."

[Touko]
"......but, what does it matter?"

[Taichi]
"It doesn't matter?"

[Touko]
"Can't it just be us?"

[Taichi]
"Come on......you know that's......"

I was pierced.
In front of the public.

[Taichi]
"This is far worse than kissing me on the train."

[Touko]
"Isn't it just fine to do it right here?"

[Taichi]
"Come on..."

[Touko]
"Though it is embarrassing..."

[Taichi]
"Listen to me."

[Touko]
"Then, I think everyone would understand."

[Taichi]
"......Touko, you've been strange lately."

[Touko]
"Didn't Taichi become strange?"

Noisy laughter.

[Taichi]
"............"

I realized it.
Touko also has something that brought her to Gunjou...... it was so obvious.
I can't determine whether it's jealousy or madness.
But bit by bit, Touko was getting out of my hands.
I was the first to come to my senses.
I easily understood that it would become more horrible as this went on.
It was best to move before it was too late.
Everyone understood that and couldn't take action.
They decided to restore their defaults.
//See what is currently line 6354 and the scene following it before messing with this line. 〜IX
........................
In the evening, I touched the shrunken and timid Touko, just a little.
Really, just a little.
We touched shoulders and looked at the sea.
Her style of anger couldn't break.
I felt like our hearts were contradicting.
I could understand a girl's heart that well.

[Taichi]
"Now then, why don't we go to bed?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, for an ojou-sama, Touko, you're weak at chess."

I stretched.

[Touko]
"......woof."

10 Wins, 0 Losses.
When we came back from the beach, Touko had withered for some reason, so I challenged her to a game in order to take her mind off of whatever it was.

[Taichi]
"Do you need a snack?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

She shook her head.

[Taichi]
"Then let's sleep."

I gave my body to the fluffy bed.

[Touko]
"......wooof......(crying)"

Touko lay down on the rough floor.
Stillness snuck in and filled the room.
I wonder if Touko fell asleep.

[Taichi]
"......sorry."

No answer.
But at long last,

[Touko]
"Hey......Taichi......"

She spoke behind me.

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Touko]
"Do you think we can be together forever......?"

[Taichi]
"......I'm always inside Touko's heart."

[Touko]
"......huhu, then maybe it's fine."

[Taichi]
"Why are you asking that?"

[Touko]
"But, people have disappeared. Someday, won't we......?"

[Taichi]
"......"

'We'...

[Touko]
"If we're going to disappear, I'd at least like it to be......together......"

Her words silently narrowed. Touko fell asleep.
For a while I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't not think about it.
When Touko is alone again, how long will it take for her to stand up once more?
Is it even possible for her to stand up on her own?
But......even if it isn't......my decision won't change.

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

My repeated apology was sucked into the darkness.
Saturday.
......one day left.
There's one day left.

[Taichi]
"Fuwaa......"

Waking up.

[Touko]
"Kuu...kuu..."

Touko was sleeping next to me.
Lightly breathing.
She seemed to be sleeping soundly.

[Taichi]
"......"

She'd crawled in here in the middle of the night.

[Touko]
"......suu, suu."

She was sleeping easy.

[Taichi]
"......hu."

Her sleeping face was like a child's.
Well, that aside,
I went outside alone.
The atmosphere was clear.
It wasn't refreshing, but it wasn't hot either.
Maybe the heat had been stolen.
There's no way to confirm it.
About Touko and I...

[Taichi]
"It's not like......we made any particularly huge memories......"

Without attaching or separating.
A week passed only with an idealistic sense of distance.
Touko neither broke nor became dependent.
Because she's not dependent......there's no need to restore her to her default.
//Any suggestions on how better to adapt what I decided to call "restore" are welcome. 〜IX
Restore......yes, that was my miscalculation.
I misread the human called Touko.
Even now, I felt a shudder.
........................
I decided to restore her.
........................

[Touko]
"Eh---?"

Restoration in progress.

[Touko]
"What did you just say?"

Restoration in progress.

[Touko]
"......that's...a lie, right?"
[Touko]
"That's one of your usual jokes, right?"

Restoration in progress.

[Touko]
"......aha, what are you saying, you idiot?"
[Touko]
"I won't be fooled, you know."
[Touko]
"............"
[Touko]
"......are you serious?"

Restoration in progress.

[Touko]
"......but...aren't you in love...with me?"

Restoration in progress.

[Touko]
"......wai-......you......"
[Touko]
"Do you understand......what you're saying?"

Restoration in progress.

[Touko]
"I absolutely......won't accept that......I won't accept that."
[Touko]
"I'll tear them apart! Everyone in the club!"
[Touko]
"And your family and everyone in this Institute!"
[Touko]
"All of them, whatever they did, I'll tear them apart!"

Restoration in progress.

[Touko]
"......Taichi......stop this......I don't like this......"
[Touko]
"Hey, let's go shopping? I'll buy you some clothes."
[Touko]
"Taichi......?"
[Touko]
"Wa......it......"

My restoration failed---
And then---

[Touko]
"......Taichi......look......"
//Definitely should look at this cg while editing. 〜IX
[Touko]
"I got...injured......Taichi......owow......it hurts......"
[Touko]
"It really hurts. I might die......"
[Touko]
"......there's lots of blood coming out......"
[Touko]
"So......be gentle......Taichi......"
[Touko]
"Be more gentle......stay by my side......"
[Touko]
"It......hurts......"
[Touko]
"Taichiiii......come ouuuut......!!"
[Touko]
"Look at meee, at my blood......would you just looook..."
[Touko]
"Because when you do, you'll want to be nice to me again."
[Touko]
"Taichiii, come ouuuuut......"

If Youko-chan hadn't been there...
Touko probably wouldn't have lived and the situation would have been even more serious.
Touko left the hospital and returned to school.
As thorough as before......no, more thorough than before---
She'd become beautiful.
I'd thought of Touko's lonely behavior as beautiful.
I covered my face.
Vivid, raw red blood.
It seemed as if it would ooze into my retinas.
I am in love.
With her.
It's just that my ethics aren't so great when it won't work.
If it was Sempai or Miki or Kiri......
I show the same tender eyes to all the humans around me.
Even for Touko there's an equal portion of love.
That's not the form of 『love』 she wishes for.

[Taichi]
"......it would be nice if this ended quickly."

It was like my heart had swollen up from the impatience of being unable to come to a conclusion.
And tomorrow is Sunday---
When I woke up, Touko was crying in her sleep.

[Touko]
"......hu......*sob*......"

She must be lonely.
I softly brushed aside the hair stuck to her forehead.
I can't fulfill everything by myself.
The time was before noon.
I'd overslept.

[Taichi]
"Touko, Touko."

I woke her up.

[Touko]
"Nnnya......?"

[Taichi]
"Wake up. We're heading out."

[Touko]
"......eh......where?"
[Touko]
"Wait, where are you going to take me?"

[Taichi]
"To a nice place."

........................

[Touko]
"Where are we......?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno."

I stood a confused Touko in the prescribed location.

[Taichi]
"......"

I stared at her.

[Touko]
"Hey......what's going to happen?"

[Taichi]
"I have a question. Please answer honestly."

[Touko]
"O-okay......"

[Taichi]
"Are you lonely?"

[Touko]
"Eh?......Hmm, I wonder about that......"

[Taichi]
"Were you lonely when all the people went away?"

[Touko]
"......I'm not sure about lonely......anxious, I guess......"

[Taichi]
"Do you want to return? To your home?"

[Touko]
"......well......if I could return to that time... ......wouldn't anyone want to?"
[Touko]
"Hey, what's this all about?"

[Taichi]
"Next question."
[Taichi]
"Touko has always been alone. Why is that?"

[Touko]
"......why?......Even if you ask that......I just don't know......"
[Touko]
"But......I was frustrated......being made an abnormal......just for that, I was pulled out......no one came and talked to me......"
[Touko]
"Were there any other choices besides being alone......?"
[Touko]
"But, because Taichi spoke to me......"

[Taichi]
"......sorry."

I just couldn't do anything but apologize.

[Taichi]
"Then, my last question."
[Taichi]
"Do you love me?"

[Touko]
"......ummm......"
[Touko]
"Yes, I love you......"

Because those were going to be her last words?
They may be ordinary, but they reached my heart.
Yes.
This is about right.

[Taichi]
"Then, Touko, don't misunderstand me."
[Taichi]
"I'm not abandoning you this time, I mean that."
[Taichi]
"I give you my word."

[Touko]
"......Taichi, I can't understand what you've been saying, but......"

*click*---
I closed my eyes.
I'm the only one who can see through the distortion.
I'm the one who decides whether that place is on this side or the other side.
Just like how I guided everyone here at first,
I was able to send them back again.
I opened my eyes and took another look.
Touko had disappeared.

[Touko]
"......just what on Earth......eh? Huh?"
[Touko]
"Taichi?"
[Touko]
"Kya!!?"
[Touko]
"Eh?......The radio? When did he put this in my pocket......?"
[Touko]
"......why can I hear it?"
[Touko]
"Taichiii, the radio, it's-!"
[Touko]
"Ah, come on......where did you go!? Idiot!"
[Touko]
"Taichi, where are you!?"

[Taichi]
"Farewell, Touko."

With this, many more possibilities disappeared.
Touko will no longer be in the classroom.
I won't be cut with a blade for all perpetuity.
Nor will I be clinging to her or clung to by her.
Nor punched by her.
All the routes Touko gave me......they've all been exhausted.
From now on, I can only hold my memories dear.
I can only ruminate and live on.

[Taichi]
"Don't pity me."

Or yourself.
I held back tears by pushing against the corners of my eyes.
I used all my strength not to worry.
It goes on.
Because there are still things that I have to do.
Next week---
