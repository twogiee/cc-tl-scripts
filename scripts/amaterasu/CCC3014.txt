Today was hot.
I felt like going to the beach.
Come to think of it, we all went together last year.
The beach was fun.
Even now, I can remember everyone frolicking around.

[Touko]
"Kiaaa!!? Where are you grabbing on to!!?"

[Taichi]
"The part of your swimsuit covering your butt."

[Misato]
"Hasekura-san......just what kind of relationship does she have with Kurosu-kun?"

[Taichi]
"Nn? Youko-chan?"

[Touko]
"Youko-chan!?"

[Misato]
"Youko-chan!!?"

[Miki]
"Youko-chan!!!?"

[Tomoki]
"Youko-chan!!?"

[Miki]
"Now you're the yakuza."

[Misato]
"No-not my body..."

[Yuusa]
"Ummm, excuse, excuse, excuse, me!!!!!"

[Touko]
"Iiidiot."

[Yuusa]
"Ah! Spin! Spinning!?"

[Miki]
"Ow, owwww, my forehead hurts..."

[Misato]
......*muttering*

[Taichi]
"But it was fun."

Our fun sea bath ended there.
Miki's wound left a very small scar.
Even so, she was bright and cheerful on the way home.
As if she'd gained something through being hurt.
It was that kind of face.
Afterward, Misato-sempai returned to school to help carry the Broadcasting Club's newly delivered antenna.
Tomoki, who still hadn't broken off relations with his sister, said something sarcastic.
That siscon behavior of his was made fun of by Miki ever since, even into their third year at Gunjou.
Yuusa-chan, for the first time, opened her heart a little toward a group of other people.
That's what the beach meant to us.
