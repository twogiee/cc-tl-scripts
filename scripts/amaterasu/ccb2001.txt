[Taichi]
"Hey, melancholy Ojou-sama."

[Touko]
"......"

Her face was horribly pale.

[Taichi]
"......are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"What is it with you!?"

Her mood was quickly injured.
I'm seriously worried.

[Taichi]
"You look pale."
[Taichi]
"Even if you don't have an appetite, your body needs food."
[Taichi]
"The body has shallower roots than the mind."

[Touko]
"That's too much trouble!"

[Taichi]
"Aren't you good at cooking?"

She said that a long time ago.

[Touko]
"......forget about it."

She wouldn't look at my face.

[Taichi]
"You're hopeless."
[Taichi]
"Come on, hold out your hand."

[Touko]
"......my hand?"

[Taichi]
"Hold it out."

Touko's face filled itself with a detective's suspicion.
Although a real detective wouldn't show it if they suspected something.

[Touko]
"......aren't you just going to make me hold something weird again?"

[Taichi]
"Heh, you say that as if I've done it before."

She spat out fictional saliva (sociability).

[Touko]
"Didn't you?!"

[Taichi]
"......eh!?"

I overreacted.

[Touko]
"Didn't you do it didn't you do it didn't you make me squeeze it and squeeze it!?"

[Taichi]
"That happened...?"

I spoke with the tone of a stupid kid.

[Touko]
"Don't play dumb!!"

[Taichi]
"I really don't remember it..."

[Touko]
"Lies! That's definitely the face of someone who remembers!"

[Taichi]
"What kind of face?"

[Touko]
"The sensation still hasn't left my hand, and yet-!!"

She was shaking.

[Touko]
"To begin with, you-! Didn't you mount someone's head once?!"
//Oh my god, Taichi's a dirty teabagger! - pondrthis
//lmao, that's what I was thinking.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Ah, the topknot."

Forbidden secret technique: the topknot.

[Taichi]
"The tastes of the aristocrats."

[Touko]
"Aren't those the tastes of a sexual criminal!!? Why would an aristocrat ever do such things!!!?"

[Taichi]
"You're an erotic aristocrat yourself, you know."

[Touko]
"Wh---!"

Her pale face turned solid white.

[Taichi]
"Using my fingers---"

[Touko]
"Didn't you make me do that---------!!!?"

*bam* *bam* *smack!*

[Taichi]
"YOU WIN!"

I danced.
Drawing a parabola as I fell.

[Taichi]
"This may be my spiritual duty, but......owww......that hurts......"

I got up and then moved the scattered desks and chairs back into position.
//That pause disturbed the flow of the line.-Spin

[Touko]
"......"

Touko had already returned to her former posture.
Her face was made of some shape memory alloy.
Aristocratic blood?

[Taichi]
"Umm, Kirihara-shan."

[Touko]
"......"
(TL Note: This is yet another random cutesy honorific that Taichi really shouldn't be using.)

A sigh.

[Taichi]
"Okay okay, if you're going to ignore me, go right ahead."
[Taichi]
"Now give me your hand."

I took her hand by force.

[Touko]
"Hey......"

*plop* *plop* *plop*

[Taichi]
"Eat mother's flavor."
//lol, even though I came up with that one line, it still sounds so weird but funny in a way.-Spin

Three round candies rolled around on the palm of her hand.

[Touko]
"Ah."

[Taichi]
"Be at ease. My two hundred million small wonderful lives aren't inside those."
[Taichi]
"They're on vacation (alol)."

[Touko]
"......of course they are."

*squeeze*
Touko gripped the candies.

[Taichi]
"You should be able to live for a while with enough sugar intake."

Cheap jokes should also be forgiven if done three at a time.

[Taichi]
"Even if you don't have an appetite, make sure you practice putting things in your mouth."

Touko glared at her fist.

[Touko]
"......you're...always like that."
[Touko]
"Pretending to be kind, being an idiot, being cold and distant, being scary."
[Touko]
"I don't understand."

She covered her face.

[Touko]
"......I'm begging you, leave me alone."

[Taichi]
"Ooohhh."

She's mad at me.
