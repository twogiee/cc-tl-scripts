[Touko]
"......-you!!"

The screaming in my ears returned me to my senses.

[Taichi]
"Wh-what?"

[Touko]
"You were spacing out. Ignoring me. Now I'm hurt."

[Taichi]
"Seriously..."
[Taichi]
"Don't I have the right to space out?"

[Touko]
"......maybe you were thinking about Miyasumi-sempai."

[Taichi]
"I was thinking about a guy."

[Touko]
"!!??"

Touko was enveloped in shock (or so it looked).

[Touko]
"A guy......no......that's......(blush)"

[Taichi]
"As if."

That would be the worst.
Although it's not necessarily wrong.

[Taichi]
"Girls who dream should be careful of those dreams."

[Touko]
"......you three idiots are always so close, I really did see a dream or two like that."

[Taichi]
"STOP!"

Disgusting.
A pure love story with one of those two...

[Taichi]
『......』

*shudder!*

[Taichi]
"Why am I thinking such disgusting things!? It's a perfectly normal friendship! Friendship!"

[Touko]
"How's it disgusting? At least you three idiots aren't too bad to look at."

[Taichi]
"......don't include me in that."

[Touko]
"No! You're still acting like the ugly duckling!?"

[Taichi]
"Shut up!"

That's a serious issue.
I'm staving it off with self-deprecating gags.
But it's true......there might not be anything wrong with my looks......
But even if I know that, a reformation of my awareness can't be done that easily.
Besides,
Besides......

[Taichi]
"Anyway,"
[Taichi]
"Punishment for thinking disgusting things!"

[Touko]
"Eh!?"

*whoosh-flutter!*
I heard that onomatopoeia.

[Touko]
"......---!!"

[Taichi]
"Heave-ho!"

I grasped the hem of her skirt and held it at the top of her head.
The disgrace this must bring to Touko is extraordinary!
And on a public road.
Now, Touko, what will you do!?
What will you do!!!? Serious samurai girl!!!!?
(Spoken like a next episode preview)
In actuality,
I prepared to be beaten, I even expected it.
But instead...

[Touko]
"........................"

She just stared at me.
Her face got a little scarlet.
Her apologetically held hands made no serious effort to guard her scantiness.
Yet I can see everything.

[Taichi]
"Why......aren't......you......m-?"

[Touko]
"......but, no one's looking......"

[Taichi]
"Tha-!"

My lips shook.

[Taichi]
"That's not true!"

[Touko]
"Why would I get mad about a skirt flip?"

[Taichi]
"You're supposed to go *blam* at this part!"
[Taichi]
"Now, show me your moves."

[Touko]
"......let go, I can't walk."
[Touko]
"Besides......it's embarrassing."

*blush*

[Taichi]
"Blushing......"
[Taichi]
"That's it?"

The girl nodded.
A cry.
Nietzsche once said:
"Touko is dead."
Nay.
The individual known as Touko has not died.
Touko and the quick-handed competitive girl once thought to be Touko have been stripped of their greatest common factor.
It means that a part of Touko's individuality has died.
Touko has become real once again.
But I liked the Touko that was always scratching me...
After all, that gives me the greatest sense of stability.
Okay, if that's what it's come down to---

[Taichi]
"Forbidden technique."

[Touko]
"Let go of me already......I can't calm down with this breeze."

[Taichi]
"I'll make the breeze even stronger. I'll make you unable to strip panties or even push napkins."

[Touko]
"......wait, you're not going to pull harder while I'm like this, are you---?"

[Taichi]
"And..."

Then I...
Released the forbidden hand,
And lowered her underwear,
Down to her ankles.
Get a mosaic, quickly! Quickly! Quickly!
Oh, it's already there? That was some fast work!
This is a matter of life and death!

[Taichi]
"Oooh, Touko! C'est si bon! (It's so good!) C'est si bon! (It's so good!)"

I made use of my strong suit, French, to praise Touko's private parts.

[Touko]
"......"
[Touko]
"........................"
[Touko]
"-ooouuuuuu!!!"

She's saying 『Yooouuu』.
Her tongue doesn't work right.
It's obvious when you kiss her.
Suck her tongue a little and it goes straight up.
On the other hand, her oral cavity is as hot as a furnace.
However, her tongue's as soft as cream, so tasting it simply intoxicates me.
My thoughts ran through the days of my lovelatios with Touko.
*Lovelatio = Taichian for general fondling of the lips and mouth......maybe. Origin unknown. It appears to come from love + fellatio.
Then,

[Touko]
"Intolerableeeeeeeeeee!!!!!"

*ka-blam!*

[Taichi]
"Come on nowwwwwww!!!"

As I danced in the air, I had this thought:
The man called Shinkawa Yutaka is no longer with us.
