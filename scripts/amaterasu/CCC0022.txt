I pushed the door open.
There was resistance.
It was being pushed from the other side.
Pushed strongly.
On the far side of the door there was a little turbulence.
It was the wind.
The antenna.
It was taking shape.
A lot of tuning was needed, for directionality and wavelength and so on.
But, I don't have that knowledge.
Sempai wasn't an expert, but I think she'd studied it.
That Sempai......wasn't here.
Tools.
Stepladder.
Books.
An empty bag of bread blown around by the wind.
Only traces of her work were left.
So I guess she's not working twenty four hours a day.
I looked up at the antenna.
A tall structure, open to its surroundings.
Apparently you need just the right environment to send out EM waves.
It's a strictly local radio broadcast called community FM.
That's not a low enough goal for a school club to aim for.
But,
The favorable location, the history of Gunjou Institute, and the goodwill of interested local people.
Those things tied together into this.
The preparations still continued, but due to a certain incident with loose ends, it had become rather indefinite.
The antenna was delivered, but then left alone for a year.
Those were the circumstances.
Most likely, the items requested for Gunjou FM were filled with hopes and dreams for healthy young boys and girls.
Sorry, but Gunjou is no such thing.
//I don't get how this line ties in with the rest. It isn't what? He was just talking about how the people in the community gave the students the antenna.-Spin
//The line makes sense to me. - Sheeta
You could say the result was all right.
Misato-sempai plans to send an SOS.
She said that on Sunday night.
After we split up and confirmed that humanity had disappeared.
Since the antenna has some altitude, an attempt to complete it so we can send a dispatch...... was certainly lacking in a sense of realism.
Honestly, I thought Sempai was falling apart.
Fleeing makes people weaker.
And Sempai was weak enough to begin with.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun?"

Behind me.
I turned to face her.

[Taichi]
"Hello there, Sempai."

[Misato]
"Hello there......ummm, what's going on?"

[Taichi]
"I came to see how things were going."

Sempai smiled softly.

[Misato]
"Is that so?"

[Taichi]
"I haven't come here for a while, but it's quite a ways along."

[Misato]
"I've been doing bits and pieces of it for a long time."

Yes,
After the Broadcasting Club broke down naturally,
Sempai's done everything on her own.
The lunch break DJ.
Various broadcasts.
Everything.
No one helps her anymore.
Kiri started being hostile toward me,
Tomoki started avoiding his sister,
Miki started smiling nervously,
Touko started ignoring me,
Splendid rubble.
Only Sakuraba didn't change.
As always, he never showed up.
Although I hung around Sempai despite all that,
She refused my help.

[Taichi]
"......is that so?"

[Misato]
"Even so, I was really surprised."

[Taichi]
"I'd bet."

[Misato]
"For all the people to go away at once..."

[Taichi]
"It's quiet."

[Misato]
"Very very quiet."

[Taichi]
"Where were you?"

[Misato]
"I'd just......gotten a bit hungry."

[Taichi]
"It's midday. Were you able to find any good food?"
//I just changed it anyway lol - Sheeta

[Misato]
"Yeah, I returned to my house. Getting food isn't especially inconvenient."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, you cut school, the prez was cutting."

[Misato]
"Th-that's not it! That's not cutting!"

She became worried.
Sempai values the rules highly.

[Taichi]
"Suspension, that's suspension."

[Misato]
"I don't want suspension, there'll be a mark on my record..."

[Taichi]
"Suspension! Suspension!"

[Misato]
"I can't be suspended..."

We frolicked together.
This was the shortest distance between any of us right now.
