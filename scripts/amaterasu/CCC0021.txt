In the end, there was nothing to do at school.
Should I go home?
But......is it okay to be so easygoing?
After Sunday, the world will roll back again.

[Taichi]
"......"

What should I do?
What can I do?
I wonder what Youko-chan thought when she first found out.
With what feelings did she leave that memo there?
I was depressed.
However I live in this unpopulated, bare world,
Everything will be redone.
Even if I work hard at the club, even if I procure food, even if I flee...
One week.
With that in mind, I went over it again.
Even if I live to the fullest---
......is there any meaning in that?
Empty thoughts.
I squatted down in the hallway.

[Taichi]
"......"

Maybe this world is ideal for me.
A world where mortal wounds aren't mortal.
Back to normal in a week.
Whoever I hurt, whoever I depend on,
Reset.
I'll get close to Touko, then Mimi-sempai next,
Then Kiri,
Then Miki,
Then Youko-chan if I feel like it,
Then Sakuraba,
......not him.
//DAMN-Spin
My eyes went numb.
My eyes have abnormalities.
It doesn't impede my daily life, but every so often the world starts to look strange.

[Taichi]
"Why......is it just me...?"

My heart was exhausted, and for a while, I couldn't move.
