"There's no choice, I'll give you this."

I took out a wrapped sandwich from my Taichi Bag.

[Miki]
"What's this?"

[Taichi]
"It has been said in myths that this was eaten between sand and a witch......"

[Miki]
"A sandwich?"

She got the jump on me.

[Taichi]
"Uguu, that's right!"

[Miki]
"You're mad......"

[Taichi]
"Take it!"

[Miki]
"Eh!? Is that okay? What about Sempai's lunch?"

[Taichi]
"I can procure any amount."
[Taichi]
"......there's enough for two, so eat it with Kiri-chin."

[Miki]
"I'm thankful and all......but..."

[Taichi]
"......when you asked her earlier, she declined."

[Miki]
"Whoa, even after humanity goes extinct you're still bothering Kiri-chin......"

Miki was shaking.

[Taichi]
"I am not one to change due to humanity's annihilation."

I informed her in the tone of a monologue.

[Miki]
"A young man indeed......"

[Taichi]
"I'm a young adult candidate. Don't make that mistake."

[Miki]
"I don't get the difference."

[Taichi]
"Young adults are those most manly of men among those who know both bitter and sweet. In other words, the ideal adult I aim to become."
[Taichi]
"Work so as to be admired by subordinates, a super elite who daunts even his superiors. And then on the weekend he has a beach adventure where he forgets about the fighting in town, then silently reads a Byron anthology in his study at night while sipping cognac."

[Miki]
"......so you had delusions of, not only girls, but your future self as well."

[Taichi]
"Do not compliment me so much, Mikkii."

[Miki]
"I am Mikkii. I'm not complimenting you."

[Taichi]
"Well, for now I'm still a candidate, just a bud."

[Taichi]
"When the flower blooms, even Kiri-chin will......"

[Miki]
"Ugly ducklings usually stay ugly as adults♪"

She said smiling.

[Taichi]
"How cruel!!"

I fell down in tears.

[Taichi]
"Even though I need Miki to live!"

[Miki]
"There, there, please don't cry♪"

[Taichi]
"......anyway, go and make Kiri-chin eat that sandwich by saying it was handmade by Mikkii."

[Miki]
"......umm, there's something about being told to do that right after receiving it..."
[Miki]
"You didn't put an aphrodisiac in here, did you?"

[Taichi]
"........................"

She mistrusted me so much it felt good.
