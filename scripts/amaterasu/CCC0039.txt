That's right.
I'll go to the first year classroom.
The Mikiri combo might be there.
There's no one here.
I looked around and found both of their belongings left on their desks.
They had come.
Were they somewhere inside the building?
Now that I think about it, school is at the midpoint between Kiri and Miki's houses.
This school that they're used to might be perfect for a rendezvous point.
No matter what they're doing.
I looked out the window.
I saw the pool.

[Taichi]
"......aaah."

They were playing.
Having fun.
Faint voices reached me.

[Miki]
"Soryaaa!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I told you no, nooo!"

[Miki]
"Sora-soraaa! Can't you dodge!?"

[Kiri]
"But we're in the water! Ah! My hair's getting wet, it's getting wet!"

[Miki]
"Where did you say you were getting wet!?"

[Kiri]
"You sound like an old man."

[Miki]
"My heart is an old man's, take this!"

[Kiri]
"Aaah, my haiiir..."
[Kiri]
"Payback!!"

[Miki]
"Kyaaa!"

I was watching a happy scene.

[Kiri]
"Yooouuuu!"

[Miki]
"Teryaryaaa!"

[Kiri]
"Take this!!"

[Miki]
"Uwaaa......yeah right, I won't take thaaat."

[Kiri]
"Ah, use of the swim board is prohibited!"

[Miki]
"It's my shield."

[Kiri]
"No fair!"

[Miki]
"It's a handicap since my hair is longer."

What kind of excuse is that?
I forced a smile.

[Kiri]
"But, you can only use one hand, so your attack strength has decreased!"

[Miki]
"Oh nooo!"

[Kiri]
"Time for the hunt!"

[Miki]
"Open season!?"

While splashing around, they negotiated with water.
So innocent.
*thump*

[Taichi]
"......!"

My heart leaped.
That innocence had touched me.
I pushed my heart unconsciously.
It's not like my soul is among my internal organs.
But what I felt had hit my real heart.
That made me happy.

[Kiri]
"Kyaaa!!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha! You fell over!"

[Kiri]
"I'm soaked......"

[Miki]
"You suuuuck at this."

[Kiri]
"......now you've said it."

[Miki]
"Ohyo?"

[Kiri]
"Now that I'm soaked, I can swim."

[Miki]
"Ah...Ah! Ah! No close quarters combat!"

[Kiri]
"You think the breaststroke can beat the crawl stroke!"

[Miki]
"Shock and awe! Shock and awe!"

[Kiri]
"I'll make you dripping wet!"

[Miki]
"Nooo! My hair turns to seaweed when it gets wet!"

[Kiri]
"I'll make you a seaweed-chan!"

[Miki]
"Wa! Wa! Not good!"

[Kiri]
"Soraaa!"

[Miki]
"Ginyaaaaaaaa!!"

The sound of splitting water.
Unceasing laughter.
It made me think of gentle, soft flowing time.
A scene from a kind world.
I think I'll write this in my diary.
So that I won't forget this feeling.
I watched the two girls play for a very long time.
