Okay, stay true to the original.
If memory serves......
As I walked down the hallway, Miki was doing some cleaning.
My hand shot like lightning, aimed at Miki's butt, yet I merely grazed her, failing to grasp her body.
Until now, Miki's always been sluggish and easy to touch.
This is a grave situation, Mr. Principal!
But seeing my pupil become more skilled does make me happy.
The day she'll surpass her master draws near.
Hmph, to her butt like lightning?
Even so, I don't know the little details from that diary.

[Taichi]
"Teryaaa!"

An unenthusiastic shout.
Along with a hand extension.

[Miki]
"!!?"

Miki's eyes flashed.
*grab!*
Our four hands folded together.

[Miki]
"I...I am in the palace, I am in the palace......"
//Probably some old Japanese reference so I doubt you would find anyone here who knew it.-Spin

She had just barely enough strength to rival me.

[Taichi]
"Please understand that these fingers must graze that butt!"

[Miki]
"I do not understand such nonsense! This Miki cannot understand it!"

[Taichi]
"Be at ease. I need only graze, not actually grab."

[Miki]
"That makes no sense at all......"

Just barrreeelyyy...

[Taichi]
"This is a grave situation, Mr. Principal!"

Since this is going nowhere, I abandoned my plans.

[Miki]
"......principal???"

[Taichi]
"Okay, I get it, I'll stop."

I untied my hands.

[Miki]
"Going mad as always I see."

She was on a subtle lookout for me.
I'd raised her into a girl with no openings.

[Taichi]
"You've improved."

[Miki]
"No, no."

[Taichi]
"I used to fondle that butt all the time, but now...it's not even something I can easily touch any more."

[Miki]
"No, no, no."

[Taichi]
"But, seeing my pupil become more skilled does make me happy. The day you'll surpass your master draws near."

Prepared text.

[Miki]
"You've been running off about weird stuff for a while now."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it. I just love the status quo."

[Miki]
"......haa."

She was fed up.
But she soon smiled.

[Miki]
"You really are the same."
[Miki]
"Even though all of this has happened..."

[Taichi]
"You can say that, but..."
[Taichi]
"There aren't any corpses. They just literally disappeared."
[Taichi]
"It doesn't feel real at all."

[Miki]
"That's true."

[Taichi]
"I don't see any dogs or cats, and even the cicadas aren't making any noise."
[Taichi]
"If all the microorganisms inside the human body disappeared, wouldn't that be bad?"

[Miki]
"Wouldn't they be fine inside our bodies?"

[Taichi]
"You're right."

[Miki]
"This situation seems to be very nice for us."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

[Miki]
"Nnn."

Miki joined her hands as if praying, and brought them up to her chin while thinking.
It was cute.

[Taichi]
"That's a good habit."

[Miki]
"Thank you. I mean......maybe we're dreaming?"

[Taichi]
"The it-was-all-a-dream ending?"
//That's only two words in Japanese, lol. 〜IX

That's rather depressing.

[Miki]
"That's awfully depressing."

Oooh, a comrade.

[Taichi]
"The fact that it doesn't feel very real certainly makes it dreamlike."
[Taichi]
"My prediction is this:"
[Taichi]
"...the FS Phenomenon!"

[Miki]
"......flying......sh...sh......sha......"
[Miki]
"Sherbet, is that it?"

[Taichi]
"Wrong."

[Miki]
"Flying......sha......sha..."
[Miki]
"Schale."

[Taichi]
"A flying petri dish. Regrettably, wrong."

[Miki]
"Flyingggg......sha......sha......"
[Miki]
"Sherlockian."

[Taichi]
"Holmes? The Japanese wrestling style bartitsu he knew is a martial art that even I admit was amazing."
//Not tlnote worthy as this is British culture rather than Japanese. And wiki has an awesome article on it. 〜IX

[Miki]
"......that actually exists you know."

[Taichi]
"It and karade are the two greatest martial arts."

[Miki]
"Yet I've never heard of either."

[Taichi]
"Because they're meta-arts."
//I wish this word meant something. I really do. 〜IX

[Miki]
"???"

[Taichi]
"They can only defeat an opponent who has fulfilled specific requirements."
//lol, 10 minutes of thinking and I know I changed meaning but it makes sense and fits with the context if you think about it.-Spin

[Miki]
"......isn't that a useless art?"

[Taichi]
"If you investigate the game you can reach meta!"

I got excited.

[Miki]
"Is that how it works......?"

[Taichi]
"Specific opponents are absurdly strong."

Though many of them are life forms not found on Earth.

[Taichi]
"Miki's karade is also coming together."

[Miki]
"The way I've been hitting you all this time was some incomprehensible martial art called karade!?"

[Taichi]
"There was no need to say incomprehensible!"

[Miki]
"......I've received the joke."

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Miki]
"Flying Shy..."

The conversation suddenly returned.

[Taichi]
"An embarrassed flying person. That'd be really funny as a painting."

[Miki]
"So in the end, what is the FS Phenomenon?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, it was the SF Phenomenon. My mistake."

[Miki]
"........................"

After being completely and utterly fooled, she made an expression that was hard to figuratively describe.

[Taichi]
"It's a slightly mysterious phenomenon......"

[Miki]
"Ah, it's okay. I understood it at that moment."

[Taichi]
"......ah, really......?"

[Miki]
"Basically, you're saying that you don't know."

[Taichi]
"Science is powerless."
[Taichi]
"In which case, it's time for a signature."
[Taichi]
"The love prince stamp sign rally. I wonder how many Miki-Miki has collected?"

[Miki]
"Yes, I am Miki-Miki. It's been a while since I got a signature from you."

[Taichi]
"Not since summer break."

I took her notebook.
Her Matebook.
There's a lie going around that the 『Matebook』 got its name from the pleasure that the founding principal was said to receive from a famous soap opera.

[Taichi]
"......"

Her notebook was filled up with my graffiti.
I recorded a new signature on a blank page.

[Taichi]
"You'll get an amazing service after the twentieth."

[Miki]
"......and I'd bet it's some perverted prank."

[Taichi]
"Nn? Did you say something?"

[Miki]
"No."

[Taichi]
"Now, this should be it for the norm."
