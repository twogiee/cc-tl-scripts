The Broadcasting Club campout.
Us first-years are advancing up a grade, and the happy third-years are retiring.
A new school year is coming.
With seven new faces.
But actually, eight.
I felt that 7/8 was okay.
She......she'd come the moment I called her anyway.
Just to gather seven people,
The price I paid wasn't cheap.
That was a huge commotion.
Which was one reason why the faculty didn't participate.
These are private club activities after all.
Mischief kept secret from the Institute.
If this was made public, there'd be some noise about it.
But I thought it was fine.
........................
We did our thing, and the campout ended.
All seven of us set off on the road home.
On the way, the sun began to sink.
I had the feeling that we'd been walking for a horribly long time.
For several hours.
Normally, this path didn't even take one hour.
Was it because of fatigue?
//Hmm, trying to connect this line with that several hours one but it's hard...will come back to it later.-Spin
No one said anything.
A world of only seven sets of footsteps.
An abnormally quiet mountain path.
Even the sounds of the insects didn't reach our ears.
Even the air felt cold.
Even though it was summer.
Although it was dark, I could still see.
//I like how the "Even" thing connected those three previous lines but this one isn't tied to those so I thought it would be better to change it.-Spin
I could see the path.
I've always had good night vision.
Around the time when I started wondering if I'd taken a wrong turn, we finally arrived at the town.
//Yea, came "out" "in" to the town was a little oxymoronic.-Spin
Humanity had been annihilated.
