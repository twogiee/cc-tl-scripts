And then club.
Tomoki had done the wiring, so I set up a tent and a long table, then arranged the equipment on it.

[Taichi]
"All that's left is the antenna."

The sketches still showed some remaining problems.
It might not make much of a broadcast.
But since it's a club, we have to broadcast as planned.
Work.
A presence.
My eyes flowed over the surroundings.
No one's here.
Did I imagine it......or not?
That means it's dangerous here. This high place.
Staying still atop a stepladder isn't good either.
Regardless of their firing range, if their effective range is at least twenty meters...

[Taichi]
"But there's so little left to do......"

Right then, Sempai came.

[Misato]
"I slept in todayyyy..."

[Taichi]
"Your lifestyle is getting more and more unhealthy."

[Misato]
"......hahaha. I have nothing to say to that."
[Misato]
"This really is...the end, isn't it......"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Misato]
"Ah, a tent."

[Taichi]
"The wiring's done too."

[Misato]
"Y-you couldn't have-?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, for Sempai, I'd......"

[Misato]
"That's amazing!! You've left nothing to be desired! Peke-kun's amazingness has gone---"

[Taichi]
"I'd like to say I did, but it was Tomoki."

[Misato]
"......"

She was disgusted.
And then amazed. Politely so.

[Misato]
"Did Tomoki help out?"

[Taichi]
"To be precise, I made him help."

[Misato]
"I see......but......he did help after all......"

She was relieved.

[Taichi]
"It's a good thing that he did."

[Misato]
"......yes."

[Taichi]
"By the way Sempai, I'm a bit famished......would you mind changing places?"

[Misato]
"Okay. You did so much already, I can finish it on my own."

[Taichi]
"The thing at the top is getting twisted, so you might want to replace it."

[Misato]
"Understood."

[Taichi]
"......now then, I'll go fight a little."

[Misato]
"Faitooo, oooh!"

While she cheered me on with one hand, I entered the building.
Nooow...
Why don't I have you show me the results of that training?
