I'll follow her.
I have a feeling something bad will happen.
Something very bad.
It should be this way.
That presence......from before.
I know it.
I know what that is.
And......I found a bicycle.
It wasn't locked.
Borrow.
Now, to the same place as yesterday---
I entered the grassy field.
Kiri......wasn't there.
Didn't she come here?
I tried looking around where Kiri had been standing yesterday.
I found her belongings. She'd come.
Did she move somewhere else?

[Taichi]
"......"

I took a deep breath.
I closed my eyes, and squeezed my eyeballs with my eyelids.
In the depths of my lenses, the image of a switch being flipped arose.
That's not what happened.
I'm just intentionally accelerating what my eyes would slowly do automatically when the luminosity radically changes.
I opened them.
The night had become brighter.
The subtle movements of the plants were clearly shown in my field of vision.
A cat's eyes---
My senses had become sharper.

[Taichi]
"I don't like this......not at all."

I even had the sense that I was something entirely different.
Now then,
Deep in the grove of trees,
I felt a faint presence.

[Kiri]
"......hya!"

I heard a scream.

[Taichi]
"!"

I ran.
The scene that filled my vision,
Called forth shivers and memories at the same time.
Dammit!!
Youko-chan's eyes are serious.

[Taichi]
"Stop!"

[Youko]
"......Taichi."

She didn't act surprised.
She'd probably noticed my approach.

[Kiri]
"......!"

Seeing an opening, Kiri moved.
But Youko-chan hadn't averted her gaze.
She flicked her wrist, rotating the belt suspended from her hand.
One revolution.
By releasing one of the two ends in her grip, the stone inside, pushed on by centrifugal force was released.
//I know there's no such thing as centrifugal force. Blame Taichi. 〜IX
//That's a joke right? Centrifugal force is real...-Spin

[Kiri]
"--!"

With timing like that, nothing could be done.
When an action is taken between moments of conscious focus, people can't deal with it in an instant.
The stone hit Kiri hard on the calf.

[Kiri]
"Gu!!"

She stooped over.
She held her leg and gritted her teeth. There should be a spasm of violent pain running through her.
My spine chilled.
That's a sling.
A weapon used by ancient shepherds to guard their sheep.
Against Kiri's crossbow, it was quite a primitive weapon.
No, it's not really a weapon.
It's not, but......that power is tremendous.
She's spinning a strap around with a stone in it and letting go.
That's it.
That propulsion, using neither compressed air nor gunpowder nor gas, comes only from the length of the strap and the number of rotations.
A bullet under the consideration of atmospheric friction.
A gun barrel in the polar regions of minute numbers.
Reliability for being used continuously under horrible conditions.
Hard studies continued for the sake of killing people.
Of course, it can't compare to small arms.
But hers......it was different.
Guided by blessed genes since her birth, despite looking like nothing more than a tender girl, she has muscles that can outperform an adult male's.
//Solved. 〜IX
It's not simply arm strength.
Agility, tension, mobility.
From that standpoint, being a woman was hardly a handicap at all.
Hasekura Youko always moves quickly and silently.
She had a good command of the arm and leg extensions for a challenging weapon like the sling.
There was no arrow set in the crossbow Kiri held.
......she must have counterattacked and missed.
This should also be a frightening weapon.
But now, it can't even be a makeshift shield for Kiri.
Without being given the time to set a new arrow, she was being driven away by the stones.
No,
She did well to live this long.
Though she probably wasn't on her guard during Youko-chan's first attack, she managed to protect herself.

[Youko]
"............"

She put a second stone in the belt.
With the tension in her wrist, she made a disk of afterimages. In an instant.

[Kiri]
"W-......wait......"

Kiri's face turned pale.

[Kiri]
"W-why are......you......?"

[Youko]
"Because you tried to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"!?"

[Youko]
"Because you've been practicing to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"......s-so......you're going to kill me......?"

[Youko]
"......"

She no longer answered.
Aaah, those are eyes of 『taking.』

[Youko]
『What's scary? Shall I take the scary thing away for you?』

She...always...『takes』 all of the things I don't like.
They disappeared from this world.
It wasn't a matter of devotion.
It was goodwill to the point of selfishness.

[Kiri]
"Aaah......"

She increased the number of revolutions.
The moving air made a sharp sound.
The destructive power swelling up before my eyes made Kiri cower in fear.
The finality of death.
That wasn't something Kiri could believe.
That rotational force had already imparted enough motive energy to the stone.
With her true skill, she could release after one rotation.
Her strength had fallen somewhat.
Thanks to that, Kiri's leg hadn't received a serious injury.
But if she hits her in the head, she'll eventually die.
Is she trying to bring her down for good?
She sharply maintained the high number of revolutions.
//lol, she's just doing it for dramatic effect now since I really doubt anything over 3-5 rotations will add anymore strength into the rock.-Spin
This time it will be more than just pain.

[Kiri]
"S-stop......"

She held the crossbow in front of her face, sobbing.
Is this Kiri's limit?

[Taichi]
"That's enough."

I stood in front of Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

The revolutions fell.

[Youko]
"If I leave that alive, Taichi will suffer more injuries."

[Taichi]
"What's so wrong about that?"
[Taichi]
"Besides, it'll all be reset."

[Youko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Let me do as I please."

[Youko]
"......no."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan."

I said her name with force.
But she didn't seem to be backing down.

[Youko]
"I'll take it."

[Taichi]
"You don't have to take it."

[Youko]
"Move."

[Taichi]
"I'm not moving."

Behind me, Kiri watched over us with her breath held.
The relief that she was alive, and the fact that I'd intervened were incompatible.

[Youko]
"But......"

I sensed hesitation.

[Taichi]
"I don't want to be used as a reason to kill people."
[Taichi]
"If you want to kill her then do it for your own reasons."

She flinched.

[Youko]
"............but, for Taichi......I......"

For me.
She'll throw out my name and kill Kiri.
Without thinking that I'd be hurt as a result.

[Taichi]
"......you're always like that, pushing for your feelings and yours alone."
[Taichi]
"Even when I am in trouble---"

Youko-chan twisted her wrist.

[Taichi]
"!!"

Kiri stuck out her head to hear our conversation.
I held my palm up in front of her face.
The next moment, sharp pain, but the stone was quelled.
//Since his pain isn't going to go down anytime soon.-Spin

[Kiri]
"Kya!!?"

[Taichi]
"......owww."

Youko-chan turned pale.

[Youko]
"Ah......sorry......forgive me......"

[Taichi]
"You betrayed me."

[Youko]
"......eh......umm......that was......"

[Taichi]
"You tried to take advantage of an opening during our conversation."

It was unpleasant.
She's always serious about these things.

[Taichi]
"......again?"

Her shoulders shook.

[Taichi]
"You say I'm precious. You say that you love me. You push your goodwill onto me."
[Taichi]
"......and yet, at times like this, you betray me."
[Taichi]
"Again?"

[Youko]
"No, this was about......Taichi's safety......"

How inconsistent.

[Taichi]
"Forget about that!"

She cowered like a young girl being yelled at.

[Youko]
"......I...I'm sorry......"

Her voice seemed as if it was about to disappear.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, please don't kill Kiri."

[Youko]
"............"
[Youko]
"......but, I can't let Taichi be killed."
[Youko]
"I absolutely will not allow that."

[Taichi]
"......I won't be killed so easily."
[Taichi]
"There's too much of a difference between what Kiri and I can do."

[Youko]
"But......Taichi, sometimes you......"

[Taichi]
"Sometimes?"

[Youko]
"Forget to resist death."

[Taichi]
"Well, considering the situation..."

I definitely have that side to me.
I'm not proud of it, but my emotions are unstable.

[Taichi]
"Well then, I promise that for this week, I'll make sure I don't die."
[Taichi]
"I'll protect myself with all my strength. In exchange, you stay back."

[Youko]
"........................"

[Taichi]
"If you can't accept that, I'll sever all connections with you."

[Youko]
"Don't......don't do that......"

A quick answer.

[Youko]
"I understand......I'll pull out."
[Youko]
"But, I'll continue surveillance."

[Taichi]
"Go right ahead."

[Youko]
"Hand over Sakura Kiri's weapons."

[Taichi]
"You heard her. Give them."

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"You're holding a crossbow and a knife, right?"
[Taichi]
"Take them out, or you're going to be killed."

[Kiri]
"............"

Kiri silently threw them in front of her.
Youko-chan picked them up.

[Youko]
"Weapons are prohibited. If you've retained any weapons, I'll interpret that as hostility."

[Kiri]
"............"

Kiri didn't come out from behind me.

[Taichi]
"Also......starting next week, be more peaceful."

[Youko]
"Uuu."

She seemed unwilling.

[Taichi]
"Please do it."

[Youko]
"......o...okay, I understand."

......easy.
And then, her body sunk into the darkness.
Her presence whisked away.

[Taichi]
"Ho!"

[Kiri]
"......"

Our stress level fell by one.
But it still wasn't zero.

[Taichi]
"........................"

Behind me, the emitter of the stress continued to release her aura.
I was conscious of it slowly becoming rage as I asked,

[Taichi]
"......are you hurt?"

[Kiri]
"Why?"

Her puzzlement and rage over being saved by me.
Her emotions fell apart, and she desperately suppressed her desire to scream out.
She had that sort of muffled voice.

[Kiri]
"Why......did you save me......?"

[Taichi]
"Well......even if you ask me why..."
[Taichi]
"I saved you because I wanted to. Is that wrong?"

[Kiri]
"Please don't make fun of me......"

[Taichi]
"......though I'm not doing that..."
[Taichi]
"Well, that's true. You wouldn't accept it."
[Taichi]
"Being saved by someone you hated."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Did you seriously intend to kill me?"

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Seriously now..."

[Kiri]
"You're too dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Dangerous?"

[Kiri]
"You toy with people for fun."
[Kiri]
"In this situation, you don't change a bit!"

Suddenly, her voice became violent.
She soon lowered her tone.

[Kiri]
"......you kill people as a joke."

The atmosphere stagnated.
Hatred was mixing into it.
The hatred Kiri was spewing forth.

[Taichi]
"I can see it really well."

I heaved a sigh.

[Kiri]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"You're only a good judge of people."

[Kiri]
"What do you......?"

[Taichi]
"You said that I was the most dangerous, didn't you?"

[Kiri]
"......that's right......but, you weren't the only dangerous one."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan?"

[Kiri]
"......even though I haven't done anything......she tried to kill me......"
[Kiri]
"Sh-she's the same kind as you......that's why you're together."

We're not the same kind.
I wanted to deny that, but it's not something Kiri would understand.
As I stayed quiet,

[Kiri]
"Why did you save me?"

Once more she started asking me.

[Kiri]
"You should've just watched me die."
[Kiri]
"You should know that I......see you as an enemy......"
[Kiri]
"You won't gain anything by saving me."

[Taichi]
"Well, well, in manga and such this is how you'd make new friends."
//Nah. I think it's fine - Sheeta

Her angry tone expanded.

[Kiri]
"I won't become a friend of yours!!"

'If I get emotional, I lose.'
Kiri had imposed that rule upon herself, but produced an angry voice of her own.

[Taichi]
"When I'm in trouble......"

[Kiri]
"I won't rush into it!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, good retort."

[Kiri]
"Uu......"

She bit her lip.

[Taichi]
"I thought of a reason why I saved you."
//Another of the lines I like. 〜IX

[Kiri]
"You thought of one......?"

I said it anyway.

[Taichi]
"If Kiri died, Miki would be sad."

[Kiri]
"............"

This is the part where Kiri cries.

[Taichi]
"So let's just leave it at that and-"

[Kiri]
"Always......mocking me..."

[Taichi]
"This is my identity. I can't treat people any other way."
[Taichi]
"So, Kiri-chin."

In the meantime,

[Taichi]
"Could you please dress this wound for me?"

[Kiri]
"Why do I have to do that?"

[Taichi]
"Isn't it bleeding?"

I've been aware of the blood trickling down my fingers for a while.

[Taichi]
"Blood is a weakness of mine."
[Taichi]
"Besides, I got this wound saving you."

[Kiri]
"But, that's something Kurosu-sempai just......"

[Taichi]
"I put my life on the line, so please do this at least."

I said clearly.

[Kiri]
"......I understand."

Honesty.

[Kiri]
"Since I don't want to be in debt."
//I think I'm forgetting the English phrase for this. 〜IX
//'be in debt' - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"Come on."

[Kiri]
"But......something like dressing a wound......"

She took out a handkerchief and wiped off the blood.

[Taichi]
"Owowow, that hurts a little."

[Kiri]
"Ah......I'm sorry......"

Kiri reflexively apologizes.

[Kiri]
"But......there's no other..."

[Taichi]
"Uu, owowow, it stings, I'm gonna die from the abundant hemorrhaging."

[Kiri]
"Uh, ummm......"

[Taichi]
"Please heal it gently."

[Kiri]
"Ah......what......???"

Hesitation.

[Taichi]
"If it was Miki-chin here right now, she'd heal me by licking it."

[Kiri]
"Licking......!?"

[Taichi]
"The wound hurts......owowow, that's harsh."

[Kiri]
"I......I don't even......want to do this......"

[Taichi]
"Please do it quickly."

[Kiri]
"I...understand."
[Kiri]
"Since I don't want to be in debt."

The tip of her tongue timidly touched my open wound.

[Kiri]
"Nn......mu......"

Hot.
And it's sticky.
As if I was being rubbed with lotion.
//Licking + Sticky + Lotion = Oh my-Spin
There's faint pain, but that's fine.

[Kiri]
"*lick*......nn!......*kiss*......aamu......nnu."

She gently traced the wound.
A sweet numbness slowly spread out from my palm.
Getting transmitted from my shoulder to my spinal cord, passed on through my spine all the way to my coccyx.
My lower abdomen got hot.

[Taichi]
"That's good, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Nnru!......nnn, nn, *kiss* nnfu......haaa."

At times, her tongue lifted, and she exhaled a hot sigh.

[Taichi]
"Clean off my fingertips too."

[Kiri]
"Nn......nnnnn......nnfuu, *lick*......nn, nn, nn......ha, nnfua."
//It sounds like you just copy and pasted from one of the h-scenes.-Spin

Her tongue meandered down my palm.
Her tongue twisted around my fingertips.
I pinched that tongue with two of my fingers.

[Kiri]
"Nnn!? N-no!......aaun......stop......"

Kiri tried to spit out my fingers.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I had a bit of an itch."

[Kiri]
"......I see......okay......"

She blushed and turned to the side.

[Taichi]
"Did you get the blood?"

[Kiri]
"......there's a little left."

[Taichi]
"Then please."

I held out my fingers, and Kiri's trembling tongue crawled over them.

[Kiri]
"*kiss* *kiss*......nnn, fua, nn......afu......"

She must be trying not to breathe through her nose, because her breathing sounded painful.
I was standing.
Kiri sucked my fingers in a crouched position.
That Kiri was...
My water level rose.
I was storing up black water.
I can't...let that happen.
At long last Kiri's tongue separated from me.

[Kiri]
"......I'm finished."

[Taichi]
"Thanks."

The bleeding had stopped.

[Taichi]
"......I think Youko-chan was serious about what she said."

[Kiri]
"?"

Kiri wiped her mouth and narrowed her eyebrows.

[Taichi]
"No more weapons. It's best not to have any."
[Taichi]
"If you break that rule, I think she'll seriously attack you."

[Kiri]
"............"

Her shoulders were shaking slightly.
From terror.

[Taichi]
"I'm not thinking of doing anything to anyone."
[Taichi]
"As you say, Kiri, I'm not good......but I don't intend to hurt my friends."

[Kiri]
"Is that...true?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."
[Taichi]
"Speaking of which, since Mimi-sempai got hurt, I've been constructing the antenna in her place."

[Kiri]
"The antenna......for the club......"

[Taichi]
"I'll send an SOS with that. You know about that, right?"

[Kiri]
"......there aren't any people."
[Kiri]
"Television won't work. Neither will radio, or internet, or phones."
[Kiri]
"Nothing will connect anymore......how can you say that anyone's alive?"

It's not just that.
The world has even renounced moving forward.
One eternal week.
To me, that had a sweet sound to it.

[Taichi]
"......the campout......was worthless, wasn't it?"
[Taichi]
"I forced it to occur, and worked to gather seven people by lying and cajoling......"
[Taichi]
"At some point the fault in that came out."

I smiled.
Kiri looked at me as if watching something heterogeneous.

[Taichi]
"We struck the tents in the worst possible mood."

[Kiri]
"......aren't you the one who planned that?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, I planned it."

[Kiri]
"In order to deepen everyone's wounds."

[Taichi]
"No."
[Taichi]
"I wanted everyone to make up with each other."
[Taichi]
"I wanted to return to the relationships we used to have."

[Kiri]
"......that's a lie."

[Taichi]
"It's true."

[Kiri]
"In order to create an opportunity for us to make up, you gathered people for a campout?"

[Taichi]
"That's right."

My eyes flashed.
The water's surface shook.

[Kiri]
"I don't want to believe......such a thing."

[Taichi]
"Well, that's fine."
[Taichi]
"The point is, unity is an important thing."
[Taichi]
"It doesn't matter how. A club or a campout or whatever."
[Taichi]
"With limited materials, we'll all build an antenna, and send out an SOS."
[Taichi]
"Isn't it okay for us to have that kind of hope?"

[Kiri]
"......there's no way......you could be such an excellent person."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I'm not excellent at all."
[Taichi]
"But, that is that, and this is this."

Using four demonstratives in a single sentence, and thereby employing the extreme clumsiness of common usage as well as the aesthetics aimed for by modern Japanese expression, I changed the subject.
//Sounds like something you would say.-Spin

[Taichi]
"I'm not excellent, but I think it'd be beautiful if we all made up."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Oh, I completely forgot, how are your wounds?"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I'm fine......don't touch me!"

[Taichi]
"If I don't touch you I won't know, so,"

Her calf.
It's swelling.

[Taichi]
"......internal bleeding. She hit a good spot."
[Taichi]
"It'll hurt to walk, but it's not life-threatening."
[Taichi]
"Anything else?"

[Kiri]
"My shoulder......"

[Taichi]
"Expose it."

[Kiri]
"!?"
[Kiri]
"You...you really are a beast......"

She held her shoulders and stepped back.

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey, I was kidding. Don't take it seriously."

[Kiri]
"Isn't that how......you sexually harass Miki and the others?"

[Taichi]
"About Miki...she does reject anything she seriously dislikes."
[Taichi]
"She'll punch me while smirking and saying something like, 'Don't do that!'"

[Kiri]
"......Miki would?"

[Taichi]
"And I don't use excessive force myself."
[Taichi]
"I am adjusting the borderline through various forms of contact, but isn't that what it means to hang out with people?"

[Kiri]
"......even sexual harassment......you can speak of it as if it's something beautiful......"

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin just takes it too seriously."
[Taichi]
"I'm going to touch your shoulder."

[Kiri]
"Eh?......kya!"

I touched it lightly, and she felt pain.

[Taichi]
"......you got hit in a bad spot here."
[Taichi]
"How much does it hurt?"

[Kiri]
"......not much......I can move my arm......"

[Taichi]
"Hold it above your head."

She obeyed.

[Taichi]
"So nothing's wrong with the bone."

[Kiri]
"......Sempai just pushed too hard."

[Taichi]
"That wasn't hard at all."

[Kiri]
"......aren't all men that strong?......even Shima-sempai, despite having such slender arms, could carry a monitor by himself."

[Taichi]
"......he used to be in the Basketball Club......he can't run anymore, but his muscles haven't changed."

Aaah, this girl can't even pick up one CRT monitor.
She's really weak.
Although the kinds in the club room are pretty big.
When I touched her shoulder, she was excessively delicate in her shock.
Like a thin plate, as if she could break at any time.
If the Broadcasting Club arm-wrestled, she'd be in last place.

[Taichi]
"......haa."

A young and helpless girl.

[Taichi]
"Put a wet cloth on that."

[Kiri]
"......you don't need...to tell me that."

Her abusive language had no strength.

[Taichi]
"Okay, then let's go home."

I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Come on, let's go."

She followed reluctantly.

[Kiri]
"Ow!"

[Taichi]
"So it did hurt. Should I carry you home?"

I cracked the knuckles on all ten of my fingers.
//I'm pretty sure there's a better way to refer to this stretch in English, but since I never do it it's not coming to mind. 〜IX

[Kiri]
"......stop, don't come any closer!"

She's seriously afraid.

[Taichi]
"It was just a joke."

[Kiri]
"I'll go home by myself."

[Taichi]
"If you go alone, Youko-chan might attack you."

[Kiri]
"........................"

She fell silent.

[Taichi]
"Now, let's go."

Light footsteps trudged along behind me.
I left the bicycle behind and walked home.

[Taichi]
"......this is a nice night."

There was no conversation.
