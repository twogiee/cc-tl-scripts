"......now then,"

Since it's before noon, the air temperature isn't that high yet.
I went to the roof alone.
Early morning.
Sempai ought to get here by afternoon.

[Taichi]
"Now,"

I got a head start on the work.
For now, there's heavy labor to do.
Even I could handle transporting heavy objects.
......
............
..................
I brought some materials to the roof.
There I came across Tomoki.

[Tomoki]
"That you......Taichi?"

He stared at me in shock.

[Taichi]
"Did you come to participate in the club?"

[Tomoki]
"......there's no way I'd-"

[Taichi]
"Sempai seems to be bothered by that."

[Tomoki]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"There seems to be a lot of stress building up within her at the moment."
[Taichi]
"And it's from family circumstances, right?"

[Tomoki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"And that's why she's being so reckless."

[Tomoki]
"You're calling it 'reckless'......"

[Taichi]
"Should I have said 'fleeing?'"

[Tomoki]
"......"

A stern expression.

[Taichi]
"......well, I do think it should be just between you and her......but honestly, it's hard to avoid asking for your help."

[Tomoki]
"......same to you, Taichi. I don't even know why you're helping her."

[Taichi]
"What else is there to do?"
[Taichi]
"Besides......I think doing this sort of thing is important to all of us."

I placed the materials on a table.
I needed some wiring expertise.

[Taichi]
"Damn it, I don't get this stuff."

[Tomoki]
"......what are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, I figured if I did this then she'd say 'Peke-kun, you're amazing!' or 'I'm so moved!' or 'I'm getting wet' and kiss me......or something. Yo, Tomoki-sensei."

[Tomoki]
"She's not going to kiss you."
[Tomoki]
"This for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, yep."

Tomoki lazily sat down on the ground.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, thanks."

Canned juice.
Though it wasn't all that cold.

[Tomoki]
"......Taichi...why are you so eager to do this?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, a serious youth-flavored question."

[Tomoki]
"You're making no sense or seaweed."

[Taichi]
"That joke was hilarious."

[Tomoki]
"......why are you working for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Can I ask something too?"

With a serious face.

[Tomoki]
"Mm?"

[Taichi]
"It has to do with......you and your nee-san. Are you okay with that?"

[Tomoki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"It's a serious question."

[Tomoki]
"......okay. What?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

I pushed out my question a little stiffly.

[Taichi]
"Why do you, a person from Kantou, sometimes use 『nan?』 for 『what?』 and 『sou yan』 for 『that's true』 like part of some pseudo-Kansai dialect?"

[Tomoki]
"That question has absolutely nothing to do with Aneki!!"
[Tomoki]
"I'm going home......"

[Taichi]
"Woah, woah, hold up a minute. Rome wasn't built in a day."

[Tomoki]
"Thank you for depressing me, Taichi-kun."

[Taichi]
"Yep. My conversations always take the scenic route."
[Taichi]
"In other words...think about it, doesn't having an objective give a person something to live for?"

[Tomoki]
"......something to live for."
[Tomoki]
"Once basic needs are met, that sort of thing might be nice."

[Taichi]
"That's why I was enamored with this."

[Tomoki]
"'This'?"

[Taichi]
"Youth Group Grafitea."
[Taichi]
"What flavor do you think this has?"

[Tomoki]
"No, that's not tea."

Tomoki stood up and circled the antenna.

[Tomoki]
"So......that's it?"

[Taichi]
"It's nice to have something to do."

[Tomoki]
"......we do have something. Like looking for materials."

[Taichi]
"At the very least, this club has hope."

[Tomoki]
"You might only be able to confirm your despair, you know?"

[Taichi]
"There's the hope that we can confirm despair."

[Tomoki]
"......I can't understand how you think, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"

[Tomoki]
"Why do you seem to be enjoying this so much?"

[Taichi]
"He-he."

[Tomoki]
"Truly, unbelievable."

Tomoki wiped his eyes with his arms.

[Tomoki]
"All I know......are the materials used in wiring mobiles and antennas."

[Taichi]
"Then help out."

[Tomoki]
"That's it? At least pretend to feel a little more gratitude than that."

[Taichi]
"Idiot, I'm crying on the inside. My tears are even bitter."

[Tomoki]
"It doesn't look that way."

[Taichi]
"It's lame for two guys to get damp with each other's tears, so go do that with your nee-chan."

[Tomoki]
"You're horrible!"

[Taichi]
"Now, if you've made that decision then hurry up and work! The planned broadcast day is tomorrow."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, yeah."
[Tomoki]
"Then I'll go procure some materials."
[Tomoki]
"......Taichi?"

Tomoki's feet stopped in front of the door.

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Tomoki]
"I thought you'd tell me to make up with Aneki no matter what, but instead you tell me to help her out as a brother."

[Taichi]
"Oh no, sibling rivalry is part of a healthy life. I wouldn't stop it."

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"The point being, I was telling you to help me out."

I stuck out my chest.

[Tomoki]
"......aren't you a big shot."

[Taichi]
"I'm the overlord of all adaptation coefficients over eighty."

[Tomoki]
"......even if you're an overlord, I'll still be your friend."
[Tomoki]
"Because I don't dislike that."

He disappeared inside the school building. As if running away.

[Taichi]
"'Because I don't dislike'......huhu!"

When Tomoki said that, for a moment his face was as red as the limits of humanity would allow.

[Taichi]
"Don't say it if you're going to get embarrassed. Seriously."

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"But, this should get it progressing a bit."

An enjoyable farce of a club.
This could become a precious memory.
So that someday, I'll see enjoyable dreams---
Surely.
Forever.
So I can feel thankful.
I think that I'm fighting.
