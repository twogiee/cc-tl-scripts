It was a bolt from the blue.
Sakuraba and I reunited during our first year.

[Sakuraba]
『Do you remember me?』

[Taichi]
『......ah?』

[Sakuraba]
『From the Gunjou Festival play.』

[Taichi]
『......you.』

[Sakuraba]
『I'm Sakuraba Hiroshi.』
[Sakuraba]
『I don't like being called by my surname, so please call me Hiro.』

That face definitely rang a bell.
Unpleasant memories were appended to it, but...
........................

[Taichi]
『Don't touch.』

[Sakuraba]
『......does it bother you?』

[Taichi]
『Why wouldn't it?』

[Sakuraba]
『Sorry.』

[Taichi]
『Forget the apology. Don't come near me.』

[Sakuraba]
『Forgive me.』

[Taichi]
『No way. Don't talk to me again.』

[Sakuraba]
『By the way, on the internet yesterday---』

[Taichi]
『............』

Unfazed. Unlearning. Undiscouraged.
Sakuraba seems to be that kind of guy.
........................

[Sakuraba]
『Yo.』

[Taichi]
『I said not to talk to me.』

[Sakuraba]
『Did you do your homework?』

[Taichi]
『Can you hear me? Do your ears work?』

[Sakuraba]
『Yeah, I can't hear. Only on one side though.』

[Taichi]
『......ah?』

[Sakuraba]
『From when I got something good from you.』

I'm pretty sure I punched him.
//I still don't get how a punch could rupture his eardrums...-Spin
But I only wanted to protect my chastity.

[Taichi]
『......so what's wrong? That was self-defense.』

[Sakuraba]
『Of course. You did nothing wrong.』

[Taichi]
『......』

[Sakuraba]
『I was inexperienced.』
[Sakuraba]
『When I think about it......I was moved.』
[Sakuraba]
『Because you were beautiful on the stage.』

[Taichi]
『Aaah, is that so? Thanks. Though I'm not happy about it.』
//"Thankies?" Seriously?-Spin

[Sakuraba]
『Be at ease. There's no longer any impurity within me.』

[Taichi]
『......I wonder about that.』

[Sakuraba]
『No. Not any more. It was shocking in many ways.』
[Sakuraba]
『It feels like a raw, uncontrollable something disappeared from within me.』

[Taichi]
『That just means you're impotent.』

[Sakuraba]
『Aaah, that's right.』

He smiled at that.
........................

[Sakuraba]
『Yo, Taichi.』

[Taichi]
『......you again......?』
[Taichi]
『I'd been feeling relieved here for a while after you went away.』

[Sakuraba]
『I went to dig up a fossil.』

[Taichi]
『Haa?』

The meaning was unclear.

[Sakuraba]
『I thought it was an Ammonite or something, but it was just a beetle larva.』

[Taichi]
『......are you a moron?』

........................
The days were dry of lunches.
Meal tickets and bread had sold out.

[Sakuraba]
『Yo, you alone?』

[Taichi]
『......』

*thud* *thud* *thud!*

[Taichi]
『What're you doing!?』

A mountain of purchased bread.

[Sakuraba]
『I bought all kinds.』
[Sakuraba]
『Let's look for the tastiest.』

[Taichi]
『......please do it yourself.』

[Sakuraba]
『You eat some too.』

[Taichi]
『Don't need it.』

[Sakuraba]
『I can't eat all of it by myself.』
[Sakuraba]
『Hey, this curry bread...it's unbelievably delicious.』

[Taichi]
『............』

I tried eating it.

[Taichi]
『Oh, oeeeeeh!』

The worst.

[Taichi]
『You think this is good!?』

[Sakuraba]
『These cutlet sandwiches are worthless. Here.』

I tried eating one.

[Taichi]
『......it's good.』

[Sakuraba]
『It is? Do you have a strange tongue?』

You do.
........................
Gunjou's curriculum has long work hours.
Even after classes end, the main gate won't open for thirty minutes.
The thirty minutes waiting in front of the gate were always a time of boredom.

[Sakuraba]
『Going home?』

[Taichi]
『......yeah.』

He stood next to me.

[Sakuraba]
『Birds are nice. I'll be a bird the next time I'm reborn.』

He said suddenly.

[Taichi]
『Your head already seems to be flying away somewhere.』

[Sakuraba]
『Hahaha.』

[Taichi]
『......do you understand sarcasm?』

........................
I became a member of the Broadcasting Club.
The first day I showed myself in the club room,

[Taichi]
『Oh, you were here......』

[Sakuraba]
『Don't accompany me.』

[Taichi]
『I didn't want to, you know.』

By the way, Tomoki had come a little late.
It seems Mimi-sempai was the scout.

[Tomoki]
『I'm Shima Tomoki, so......hello.』

[Sakuraba]
『I'm Sakuraba Hiroshi. I don't like being called by my surname, so please call me Hiro.』

[Tomoki]
『......well......eventually......』

He was made wonderfully indecisive.
........................
The three of us spent prescribed time in the club room.
It was decided.

[Tomoki]
『I said that's not right......why're you making that mistake?』

[Sakuraba]
『Because this way's more interesting.』

[Tomoki]
『Shougi is a battle.』

[Sakuraba]
『I do interesting things when I play.』
(TL Note: "Shougi" = Japanese chess. The rules are pretty similar to Western chess, but with more pieces, like the Gold General, Silver General and Lance.)
[Sakuraba]
『Hey, Taichi, wanna join in? Let's play.』
(TL Note: Shougi also has a more complex promotion system and rules for returning captured pieces to the board.))

[Taichi]
『......ha.』

I shrugged my shoulders.

[Tomoki]
『......something about Kurosu doesn't feel right.』

[Sakuraba]
『Really? I like him.』

I can hear conversations in low voices.
Please stop.
I wanted to scream.
........................

[Tomoki]
『That was your job!』

[Taichi]
『......I didn't think I had any obligation to do it.』

[Tomoki]
『You do, since you're a member of the club.』

[Taichi]
『Let it go, Siscon-kun.』

I said with contempt, and made Shima Tomoki's face flush for a moment.

[Tomoki]
『......you!!』

We got into a scuffle.
He jumped on top of me.
Amateur!
I hit him.
I went easy on him.
I hit him in such a way it inflicted pain without really hurting him.
While hitting, I was bored.
I was sick of this trivial third-rate performance.
I realized eyes were on me.

[Taichi]
『What are you looking at?』

[Sakuraba]
『I'm just looking.』

[Taichi]
『Is this interesting?』

[Sakuraba]
『It's youthful.』

[Taichi]
『............』

[Sakuraba]
『What's wrong? Keep at it until you're satisfied. Raise your youth level higher.』

[Taichi]
『......』

[Tomoki]
『......』

We stood up.

[Taichi]
『......I'm done. This is stupid.』

[Tomoki]
『Hey, your job!』

Shut up.

[Taichi]
『Heh-heh......I'll do it.』

[Tomoki]
『......will you now? If only you'd do these things right away.』

[Taichi]
『I don't know a thing about this stuff.』

[Tomoki]
『Then why not ask someone about it?』

He said as if it was something obvious.
Cut lips.
Even though he was frowning from the pain, Tomoki said nothing bitter.

[Sakuraba]
『Hey.』

[Taichi]
『What?』

[Sakuraba]
『......is your youth over already?』

[Taichi]
『......』
[Taichi]
『Work.』

........................
If he helped out, he'd be doing the same thing......

[Sakuraba]
『Heeey.』

[Taichi]
『Yoooo.』

[Sakuraba]
『......I'm shocked.』

[Taichi]
『What happened? Did you get interviewed again?』
//I wonder how many of you still remember why Sakuraba got interviewed. 〜IX
//I do! - Sheeta
//Prove...it? Ah, fuck it. I'm not in the mood.-Spin

[Sakuraba]
『A cat died.』

[Taichi]
『Ah?』

[Sakuraba]
『A cat was run over by a car and died. That's not good. Not good at all.』

[Taichi]
『......run over you say......hey......why are you crying?』

[Sakuraba]
『......I don't know. It's probably because of the cat.』

[Taichi]
『Probably......?』

[Sakuraba]
『I can't stop.』
[Sakuraba]
『......I can't stop.』

It seems that he was surprisingly naive.
However, due to Sakuraba's peculiar standards,
After another while,

[Sakuraba]
『Hey, I'm shocked.』

[Taichi]
『What is it this time?』

[Sakuraba]
『It seems I'm being made into the laughing stock of the school.』

[Taichi]
『Don't just notice that now.』

I instructed him in a speechgiving tone.

[Taichi]
『Understand that sooner.』

[Sakuraba]
『......am I that comical a man?』

This guy might just be insensible to malice.
Well, anyway,
Won't he, by some chance, eventually be crushed?
That's what I thought at the time.
But actually......it was the exact opposite.
No matter how much Sakuraba got depressed, he had the toughness to revive from any crushing mental defeat.
After hurting for some time, he would do something reckless to heal himself.
He went on journeys, danced and played music.
He generally recovered within a week.
........................
And then we somehow started hanging out together.
The peach park vow was something that happened a while after that---
