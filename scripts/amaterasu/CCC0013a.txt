A faint smile.
I was controlled by a mischievous heart.
I softly approached her back,
And killed my presence.
Slowly, without making a sound.
Now, I wonder when she'll notice.
Maybe I'll make a sound right behind her.
One step. Two steps.
Kiri seemed unaffected.
If I wrapped my arms around her......it'd be my victory.
I could seal off all of Kiri's resistance.
I wouldn't take a minute to make her lose consciousness.
And then---

[Taichi]
"............"

That was sudden.
I became aware that I was being made to move by my own horrible animal passions.
//Old line just didn't really make much sense without actively thinking about what it meant.-Spin
This can't go on.
I'll hurt Kiri.

[Taichi]
"............"

I took a step back.
Without making a sound.
Further, and further, back to my original position.
//Makes it sound better.-Spin
Then, Kiri turned around.
She noticed me near the entrance and tensed up.

[Taichi]
"Heeey."

[Kiri]
"......Kurosu...sempai."

The atmosphere you get between two enemies drifted through the room.

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes, Kiri-chin's Kurosu-sempai."

[Kiri]
"......what do you want?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing."

She pointed to the entrance.

[Kiri]
"Please get out if you have no business with me."
