Touko made me carry all our belongings on the way home.

[Taichi]
"......uuuaaa."

[Touko]
"Fight! Taichi♪"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

I had no right to oppose her.
This stuff was light.
But the hills made it painful.

[Touko]
"♪♪"

Well, isn't she enjoying this...
//Since this is sarcasm, I thought this would make it flow better. Also, is there a way to emphasize "she" without using all caps? One more thing... question mark? - pondrthis
But, it's a good thing that she didn't get any angrier.

[Touko]
"Hey, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah?"

[Touko]
"Will we really go to the beach?"

Aaah.
She's looking forward to that.
People become happy when they can look forward to something.
Even though everyone dies alone.
The fact that they're all solitary.
They have the power to forget that and have fun.

[Taichi]
"......we'll go."

[Touko]
"Yeah!"

[Taichi]
"Would you prefer to go as a pair, or as a crowd?"

[Touko]
"Eh? A crowd?"

[Taichi]
"I mean, we could invite everyone who wants to go as well."

[Touko]
"......I wonder if anyone would want to."

[Taichi]
"Good question."

Sakuraba's fine.
Not sure about Tomoki. He might be busy with the Life Club.
Misato-sempai has her own club...
Miki might be okay.
Kiri's harsh, but if Miki comes she'll likely follow.
Youko-chan is...out of the question.

[Taichi]
"I think some would come."

[Touko]
"Taichi......which would you like?"
[Touko]
"Going with everyone, or just the two of us?"

I glanced at her face.
Is she not yet used to being in love?
Is she just innocent?
I honestly like this side of her.

[Taichi]
"......"

Now that I think about it, I might actually love Touko.

[Taichi]
"Haha!"

[Touko]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Then let's go with everyone tomorrow, and next Friday just you and me will go."
//"Then" is an odd way to start a sentence answering her previous question. - pondrthis

Her expression sparkled.

[Touko]
"You're right, that'd be nice."
[Touko]
"We'll have to bring a bentou."

[Taichi]
"......and I'll be making it?"

[Touko]
"I'll help."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, the Harakiri Blade is too long for our kitchen."
//it's been capitalized in other scripts. - pondrthis

[Touko]
"I won't bring a sword in there!"

But you'll summon it......

[Touko]
"Nnn, but can we gather everyone together?"

[Taichi]
"There's nothing to do at night anymore."
[Taichi]
"Besides, I'm nocturnal. The night's better."

[Touko]
"You mean you watch midnight variety shows?"

[Taichi]
"......that's not quite what I meant."
[Taichi]
"Well, just leave it to me."

[Touko]
"......"
[Touko]
"Hey, can I carry half of that?"

Oh? Oh?

[Taichi]
"It's okay. This is nothing."

[Touko]
"Then, I'll help you this way."

She wrapped her arms around mine.

[Taichi]
"Whoa..."

[Touko]
"Huhuhu."

How's that helping me at all......?
Ah, whatever.

[Touko]
"♪♪"

As I looked at her happy face, the evening sun was far too red. It made me swell up with mischief.
......I started wanting to break this apart.
These, our last days in this hopeless world.
I closed my eyes tightly.
The evening sun was bad.
Its color reminds me of the world's destruction.
//Weird wording again.-Spin
A long time ago, I used to wonder whether the world was being destroyed once every day.
//I don't know how to better connect this with that previous line. It really stuck out.-Spin

[Taichi]
"......ah."

On top of the hill.
There she was.
The bicycle girl.

[Nanaka]
"........................"

She extended her arm horizontally.
Her fingers were pointing somewhere.
I looked.
The mountain?
No, the mountain path......that leads to our campsite.
I returned my gaze, but she was no longer there.

[Taichi]
"............oya?"

[Touko]
"Next week, let's cut our hair."
[Touko]
"It'll feel refreshing to cut it short. We'll be able to live laughing."
[Touko]
"We'll live like American farmers. And for dessert we'll eat maize."

[Taichi]
"That's right."

It seems Touko couldn't see her.
Even though she was right in front of us.
A little mysterious.

[Taichi]
"......so, why maize?"

[Touko]
"When you're at a formal dinner, how do you eat?"

[Taichi]
"Eh? With a knife and fork, I guess."

[Touko]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"That seems hard to cut with a knife......"

[Touko]
"But if it was for dessert?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm......"

Touko chuckled.

[Touko]
"Then it's okay to eat with your hands."

[Taichi]
"......is that how it works?"

[Touko]
"What do you think we do with bananas?"

[Taichi]
"Peel by hand."

[Touko]
"Okay, you fail."

[Taichi]
"You cut them with a knife?"

[Touko]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"......whoa, I do not understand etiquette."
//The set of all "good manners" is called "etiquette" usually. - pondrthis

[Touko]
"If we live together like that, people will gather here soon."
[Touko]
"Because everyone's going to come back."

Let's hold that hope.

[Taichi]
"Or perhaps, we could make them."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"......"

I started wanting to kiss her.
//"I felt a desire to kiss her boil up within me." :P Just kidding, but the line seems a little unromantic compared to the rest of the scene. - pondrthis
I grabbed her jaw delicately.

[Touko]
"......lecher."

*chomp!*

[Taichi]
"Owwwww!! Don't bite my finger!"

For dinner we ate our fill of canned food.
