"Hmm?"

There was a note left on top of the table.
『There might be dinner.』

[Taichi]
"Yaaay, I'm going, I'm going!"

I didn't have to make it myself.
I took three minutes to change, then went to her house without delay.
//It is not specified who "she" is until later scenes.〜IX
Dinner was quite delicious.
I lit the candle.
The solitary glimmer shone upon the inside of the room.
I liked candles.
The raw flame captivated me.
The wavering flame captured my soul as I watched it, allowing me to doze on forever and ever.
I once burnt my bangs doing that.
That was just three minutes ago.

[Taichi]
"......it burnt......damn it."

I wanted to cry.
But now for my diary.
I opened up the bulky notebook.
A record of one's life is a precious thing.
I went to school today, but I cut class.
Touko was especially harsh today.
Must be biological.
But I can't strike at her just because of her biology.
Instead, I'll do horrible things to her in this diary.

[Touko]
"No! Stop!"

[Me]
"Heheh, even if you claim to hate it, your body is perfectly honest. (paraphrased)"

[Touko]
"Ah! That's... no, stop it, stop it!"

[Me]
"Impossible! No man can pull back after coming this far! My rifle of pride has no choice now but to lock on to a target such as yourself!"

[Touko]
"Noooo! My body, not my bodyyy!!"

[Me]
"In time, you will come to desire this yourself."

[Touko]
"No, have mercy!!"

[Me]
"You think I'll listen to such pleas?! Doooryaaa!!"

[Touko]
"......you beast!!!"

Here I raised up the vase holding its red rose.
At last the flower's stalk snapped, and fell silently.
The screen blurs. Whiteout.

As I walked down the hallway, Miki was doing some cleaning.
My hand shot like lightning, aimed at Miki's butt, yet I merely grazed her, failing to grasp her body.
Until now, Miki's always been sluggish and easy to touch.
This is a grave situation, Mr. Principal!
But seeing my pupil become more skilled does make me happy.
The day she'll surpass her master draws near.
I went to club for the first time in a while, and Mimi-sempai was quite fluffy.
Today, I reached a milestone.
I'm greatly moved.
A lot of other stuff happened, too, but overall it was a good day.
