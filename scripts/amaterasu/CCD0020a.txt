[Taichi]
"Hello."

[Misato]
"Aaah, good morning."

[Taichi]
"How are you doing?"

[Misato]
"Not at all favorably."

[Taichi]
"Must be rough."

I looked at the antenna.
At the base was a steel frame, wires, tools......woah, woah, don't leave your tools in such a high place.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, so this is the antenna..."

From the top of the stepladder, I lowered the dangerous objects to the ground.

[Misato]
"......ummm?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's more like it."

All of the tools that were caught on parts of the antenna were back on the ground.

[Misato]
"Are you fully awake?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, I'm super calm."
[Taichi]
"Well then, see you later."

Sempai stared at me as I left.
By messing up the timing, she won't get hurt ......probably.

[Taichi]
"Ah."

......won't there be no progress with her if she isn't hurt?

[Taichi]
"But still..."

Even so, letting an accident happen is just......

[Taichi]
"Haa."

In the end, it won't have any effect to speed up my conquest.
