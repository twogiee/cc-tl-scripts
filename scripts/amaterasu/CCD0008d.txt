Touko was in the classroom.
Faithful to the records.
I'm sure this girl doesn't have any other place to go.
She's not strong enough to coop herself up alone at home.

[Taichi]
"Touko, are you eating well?"

[Touko]
"......"

She shot me one glance, then looked elsewhere.
It was as if innumerable messages were contained in only that action.
I couldn't feel the atmosphere she was pushing on me with the corners of her eyes.
It just looked like pouting to me.

[Taichi]
"Don't ignore me."

I pinched her cheek.

[Touko]
"Stop that!"

She brushed me off.

[Taichi]
"But you're ignoring me."

[Touko]
"Figure it out!"

She's mad.
I've known that that's Touko's first step towards interaction.

[Taichi]
"Squeeze!"

[Touko]
"Stooop thaaat!"

[Taichi]
"That was fast. Today's the opening ceremony so there aren't any classes."

[Touko]
"There's no opening ceremony either!"

[Taichi]
"You came in casual clothing again."

[Touko]
"I don't want to wear this school's uniform."

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

[Touko]
"Won't I look like an idiot!?"

[Taichi]
"Such cruel talk."

She's misunderstanding.

[Taichi]
"Everyone's just a little unusual in the head, that's all."

[Touko]
"Isn't that why society would see me as an idiot!?"

[Taichi]
"Isn't that why you fight?"

[Touko]
"......haa?"

[Taichi]
"How do you protect yourself from attack?"
[Taichi]
"You behave the same as them, behave normally, you have to blend into them."
[Taichi]
"Isn't that an option?"

[Touko]
"......why are you talking so seriously? And this early in the morning..."
[Touko]
"......in the first place, there aren't any other people any more. Everything we do is useless."

[Taichi]
"Are you going to do nothing like that, every week?"

[Touko]
"Every week?"

I slipped up.
I need to distract her.

[Taichi]
"Reserve army of old ladies that say 'ever so.'"

[Touko]
"Whaaat did you sayyyy!!?"

[Taichi]
"There, that's it."

Can I give life to Touko by following the ignitions mentioned in the notebooks?

[Taichi]
"Touko's old ladyness is now at ninety-two percent. The average is twenty-five percent so you're in mortal danger. On top of that, it increases one percent with every added year, so you'll be a complete, scathing old lady before reaching thirty."

[Touko]
"........................"

Begin counting seconds. Three......two......one......

[Touko]
"○×△□＄＃％＆○×△□＄＃％＆-----!!"

She burned, she burned.
Combustion becomes Touko's power to live.
......whether that's true or not, good luck.
Inside my mind, I yelled her on.

[Touko]
"Say somethiiiing!"

[Taichi]
"Wa!!"

I evaded attack.
Is it time?

[Taichi]
"See you."

[Touko]
"Ah! W-wait right there!!"
