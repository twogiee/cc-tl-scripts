Kiri's face turned red.

[Taichi]
"What's next?"

[Miki]
"Isn't it obvious?"
[Miki]
"I said to strip the bottom."

[Taichi]
"............"
[Taichi]
"Are you sure?"

I asked seriously.

[Taichi]
"Do you know what it would mean to expose this?"

[Miki]
"A threat at this stage?"

[Taichi]
"So idiotic. Little do you know how fearsome this thing is."
[Taichi]
"Unlike that crossbow, this isn't some cute thing that the untrained can easily control."
[Taichi]
"It greedily devours those called virgins, even their membranes, to no end......it is truly a demon."
[Taichi]
"If you release it once, it is certain that the radiance of the world's virgins will disappear."

[Miki]
"......such nonsense."

[Kiri]
"Hey......I don't really want to see......"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, be quiet."

[Kiri]
"......o-okay."

Dejected.
Miki is serious.

[Taichi]
"......do you intend to return all to nothing?"

[Miki]
"What if I said yes?"

[Taichi]
"Wh-!? You're...you are......and you call yourself a scientist!?"

[Miki]
"Science is that which investigates. It is that which continues beyond the taboos."

[Kiri]
"I can't see the flow of this conversation at all......"

[Miki]
"There is no meaning in science done while looking backwards, professor."

[Taichi]
"Ku! Have you sold your soul to the devil?"

[Miki]
"Yes, just like Einstein did."

[Taichi]
"This won't end......"

I touched my nipple.

[Taichi]
"To think I'd have to use this blasting switch..."

[Kiri]
"........................"

Kiri lowered her crossbow and entered the bathroom.

[Miki]
"Blasting switch?"

[Taichi]
"That's right. I cannot allow this superb specimen of a demon to be released into the world."

[Miki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"There will be peace to all ladies. Wives and children, I am sorry......forgive your foolish fathers!"
[Taichi]
"......nn?"
[Taichi]
"What's wrong with this? The device won't function?"

[Miki]
"......huhu, I have long since seen through all your actions, your highness!"

[Kiri]
"The cast has changed......"

Kiri returned from the bathroom and idly reaimed her crossbow.

[Taichi]
"The casting......damn it! What a thing to happen!"

[Miki]
"Your back's against the wall now."

[Taichi]
"Hu......"
[Taichi]
"Did you forget...that there are two nipples!?"

[Miki]
"-!?"

[Taichi]
"Drowned in science, you've neglected human engineering......Miki-kun, you have lost!"

[Miki]
"You won't get away with this!"

Miki jumped onto Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Eh!? Wait a......!?"

A small warning light shone on her forehead.
Kiri quickly shifted the point.
The arrow flew.

[Taichi]
"--!!!!"

As one would expect, even though I was watching it, I couldn't react to it.
It grazed the side of my cheek.

[Taichi]
"............"

I turned around to see it sticking into the hallway wall.

[Taichi]
"........................"
[Taichi]
"Mimimimi......"

[Miki]
"I'm sorry, Professor."

[Taichi]
"I'm no Professor! That's dangerous! That was really dangerous!"

[Miki]
"......ehaha."

[Taichi]
"Don't gimme that 'ehaha' you..."

Uwa, I have cold sweat.

[Taichi]
"I...I thought I was gonna die......"

[Miki]
"I'm sorry......"

[Taichi]
"No, it's okay, since I'm alive."
[Taichi]
"Right, Kiri-chin?"

[Kiri]
"Eh, ah, ha......"

Kiri stared blankly.

[Taichi]
"Doesn't Kiri-chin also have an apology for me?"

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"You tried to take my life. You can't sweep this away as a joke."

[Kiri]
"......that's..."

[Taichi]
"That's?"

[Kiri]
"........................"

I could see complications.

[Taichi]
"'I'm sorry,' right?"

[Kiri]
"............uu."

Tears welled up.
Was the idea that unpleasant?

[Taichi]
"Where's my sorry?"

[Kiri]
"............s......sor---"

The moment she tried to push out those words,
I very much wanted to reset it.

[Taichi]
"Actually it's okay. I'll take my own sign of apology."

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"Teyaaa!"

*akesuke!*
I heard that onomatopoeia.

[Kiri]
"---???"
(TL Note: The nonsense sound "akesuke" might be a pun based on "akeru (to open)" and "sukebe (lecher)".)
[Kiri]
"H-huh? Huhuh?"

[Taichi]
"Did you see!?"
[Taichi]
"This is the epitome of skirt flipping, the Parachute Death Sentence!"
[Taichi]
"At the moment the fingers grab cloth to access the skirt, joints in twenty four places throughout the body simultaneously engage to produce the minimum turbulence within the bewitching closed space of the lower half of a girl's body."
[Taichi]
"With this action, the upflipped skirt is maintained in a parachute shape, exposing underwear to the eyes of the masses with a duration several times longer than any ordinary skirt flip!"

[Miki]
"......Sempai, you're not a person anymore."

[Taichi]
"However, that overlong time of nakedness causes the level of shame to skyrocket, and at the final moments of the parachute's effective time, it will become a death sentence against my very life! A move done in exchange for one's life: that is the Parachute Death Sentence!"

[Miki]
"......it must be hard to be a pervert."

[Kiri]
"Wh-why won't it go back......wh-wh-wha!?"

Kiri pushed down on her fluttering skirt.
But, when she pushed, it simply flipped higher up.
Even left alone, the skirt continued to expose her underwear in a jellyfish shape.
Almost as if wind was blowing up from below her.

[Taichi]
"A double-edged sword. There is no guarantee that friends will remain friends after this."
[Taichi]
"Make the most of this lesson, Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"My skirt! It's......floating, wait, what is this!?"

[Miki]
"That's an amazing move......"

[Taichi]
"Lovely, Kiri-chin."

I gave her a thumbs-up.

[Kiri]
"Aa-aa-aaaa-aaaaa......"

Kiri-chin was flustered.
If this had been done in public, she might have died in agony.
A secret technique indeed.
Since it won't move Youko-chan at all...
It really isn't a skirt flip without the girl rushing to unflip it.
At long last, the skirt floated back down.

[Kiri]
"......ha......haa......"

She's sweating a lot.

[Taichi]
"The time needed to perform the Parachute Death Sentence is no more than 0.05 seconds. So, once more I shall let you see the process by which---"

I put a hand on Kiri-chin's skirt.

[Kiri]
"Cheyaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

[Miki]
"She hasn't used a kick in a long tiiiime!"

[Taichi]
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

Her downward kick changed its path in zigzags on the way down.
There was true turbulence in her kick.

[Taichi]
"Ooooooo......"

[Kiri]
"You are abnormal!!"

I was being treated as abnormal.

[Taichi]
"Owww......"

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki!"

She was fuming.

[Taichi]
"......aah-ah, there she goes..."

[Miki]
"I respect Sempai's challenge mentality."

[Taichi]
"Yes. We never know when a human will die."
[Taichi]
"Weeell, you two live on freely and easily."

[Miki]
"Yeees."
[Miki]
"Still......you two really don't get along well."

We both smiled wryly.

[Taichi]
"Kiri and I are enemies-slash-friends in our love for Miki-Miki."

[Miki]
"That's true, you are great rivals."

[Taichi]
"......"

She said flatly.

[Kiri]
"Miki!"

[Miki]
"Hoooi. Then, Sempai, see you again sometime."

I returned her farewell with an awkward smile.
Miki ran, catching up to Kiri.
