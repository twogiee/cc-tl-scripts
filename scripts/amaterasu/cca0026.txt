[Taichi]
"Ah, that's right."
[Taichi]
"Sempai, please wait here a moment."

[Misato]
"What?"

I went,
And came back.
I held them out in both hands.

[Taichi]
"Handmade popsicles!"

[Misato]
"Ah! That's amazing!"

I passed one to her.

[Misato]
"It feels like the underlying strength of humanity."

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu, you speak presumptuously of the one and only Kurosu Taichi."

[Misato]
"It's cooold and deliiiiciousâ™ª"

[Taichi]
"Humanity banzaaai."

[Misato]
"Banzaaai."

Many cheers for popsicles.

[Misato]
"What were the ingredients in these?"

[Taichi]
"Lemon and sugar and egg whites and-"
[Taichi]
"......my two hundred million cute little wonderful lives."

Sempai stopped cold.
For some reason her glasses suddenly fogged up.

[Misato]
"............"

This atmosphere is bad.

[Taichi]
"Umm, you know that's a joke, right?"

[Misato]
"......please exchange this for yours."

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes."

[Misato]
"If you're going to say such foolish things, then you're going to have to be punished."

She said that with no strange intonation.
I was so scared.

[Taichi]
"I-I'll be sure not to do that again!"

[Misato]
"......honestly."

The fog on her glasses cleared up in an instant.
Is that voluntary?
How can she control that?
I was afraid.
But, there was a benefit from that risk.
Indirect kiss!
On top of that, with something as sticky as a popsicle, it was a deep indirect kiss.
I'm thoroughly satiated with this.

[Misato]
"I originally came here to thank you, but ended up receiving something nice in return."

[Taichi]
"Hu, it's nothing. Please don't fall in love with me so easily."

[Misato]
"That was delicious, Peke-kun. And I'm not falling in love."

She has no heart.

[Misato]
"Thanks to that I feel refreshed."

[Taichi]
"Since it's always hot these days."

[Misato]
"It is hot."

[Taichi]
"Since it's summer, it's to be expected."

[Misato]
"......I'd like to go to the beach."

Sempai looked out the window.
It was too dark to see the ocean, which should be in that direction.

[Taichi]
"Then let's go there."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow at lunch we'll gather in front of the school."

[Misato]
"Eha?"

[Taichi]
"We'll call everyone, of course."

[Misato]
"B-but in only one day......"

[Taichi]
"It'll come about somehow!"

I raised my thumb.

[Misato]
"But......Kiri-san, and Hasekura-san, would they come?"

[Taichi]
"Nnn, that'll depend on my plots."
[Taichi]
"Faith isn't needed to move the masses. You just have to hit them where they hurt. Wahaha."

[Misato]
"......I'd prefer it if you didn't say such cruel things with a straight face."
[Misato]
"Ah, but I might not fit into last year's swimsuit."

[Taichi]
"EEH?"

[Misato]
"Hu, that's not because I've fattened up!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, in other words, you've experienced growth?"

[Misato]
"That's right."
[Misato]
"That's really it."

[Taichi]
"No, I wasn't doubting that."

So her breasts are still getting bigger...
My thoughts raced around Sempai's bust.

[Misato]
"......!"

She must have felt some kind of evil force, as she hid her breasts with both arms.

[Misato]
"And that's why I need a new......"

[Taichi]
"Which one?"

[Misato]
"You have them----!!?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe the standard bikini strap."

[Misato]
"Why do you have those--------!!?"

[Taichi]
"But your size is an 86 C-cup, so maybe this one."

[Misato]
"Hiki!!?"

[Taichi]
"How about something like this shell and strap shameless ocean paradise?"

[Misato]
"I'll never wear that!!!"

[Taichi]
"Then this one! A pearl white knock-out bikini."

[Misato]
"But you can see through it even before it gets wet......"

[Taichi]
"It's a bit odd, but this ropeless patch is-"

[Misato]
"Isn't that just the front half with some adhesive!!? Are you stupid!!?"

[Taichi]
"Or why not have fun with this one? It has see-through vinyl around the breasts so you can pretend to be topless......"

[Misato]
"I'm-I'm going to be raped!"

Sempai covered her face.

[Taichi]
"There's even a female loincloth here."

[Misato]
"Why do you have nothing besides those!!!"

[Taichi]
"Here's something else: a swimsuit that idiots can't even see. A naked empress to test people's intellect..."

[Misato]
"How's that different from being naked!?"
[Misato]
"Rejected! Rejected-rejected-rejected-rejected-----!!!"
