When I left my house to go to school, Hasekura Youko was there.

[Youko]
"Good morning, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Yeah. So, now I'll be saying bye-bye."

I walked away.
My sleeve was grabbed from behind.

[Taichi]
"Gueh......"

[Youko]
"You...you could talk to me a little......"

Her voice was shaking.

[Taichi]
"You may be dependent on me but, you sometimes work against me."
[Taichi]
"That's why I can't completely trust you."

[Youko]
"Producing an appropriate stimulus."

[Taichi]
"Don't you want to make me dance in the palm of your hand, you squid-bellied girl?"

[Youko]
"......like Shima Tomoki. A little bit disillusioned."

I was disillusioned.

[Youko]
"Isn't that just fine? Taichi's rather monkey-like after all."

[Taichi]
"Don't make fun of me. I am a primate."

[Youko]
"............"

I had the feeling that I was being made fun of.
Damn, she's defiant.
I'll harass her.
I flipped her skirt.

[Youko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Be you not adorned with a prurient pair of shorts?"

[Youko]
"Women are always serious."

She didn't budge.

[Taichi]
"I'll lower your panties you know?"

[Youko]
"......will you?"

[Taichi]
"I won't......"

[Youko]
"Go ahead."

Uuu...
Boring...
This girl has no fetish.
She has no shame.
No good.
There's no way I can give her my cherry soul.
Leaving physical methods aside,

[Taichi]
"Then this."

I took 'that' out of the Taichi Bag.
Then I pinched her nose.
I waited for the moment her mouth would open for oxygen.

[Youko]
"......"

Five seconds.
Ten seconds.
Thirty seconds.
One minute.
One and a half minutes.

[Taichi]
"......umm, do you need to breathe?"

[Youko]
"............"

Why is she fine?
I stopped.
When I let go, she took a shallow breath.

[Youko]
"If your blood oxygen level is high, you can stop breathing for a long time."

[Taichi]
"Are you a mermaid?"

[Youko]
"What did you want to do?"

[Taichi]
"......I was thinking I'd make you open your mouth."

[Youko]
"Aaah."

That was easy.

[Taichi]
"Stick out your tongue."

[Youko]
"Nnnn."

A long tongue.
I sprinkled ten drops of Tabasco.
I rubbed them in with my fingers.
What a thick tongue.
And its surface was quite rough.
With those attributes, she could be the greatest of the pink salon girls.

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'm finished."
(TL Note: "Pink salons" are Japanese brothels specializing in oral sex.)

[Youko]
"......"

I thought for a moment that she might be fine.

[Youko]
"......!!"

She held her mouth and started shaking.
She leaned against the brick wall.
It worked.
Because she has such a superb tongue, she's more sensitive.

[Taichi]
"Want some juice?"

[Youko]
"......yes, yes......quickly......"

She drank as if tearing off part of the bottle.

[Taichi]
"Is chili juice delicious?"

[Youko]
"Uu......"

She faced the fence and collapsed.

[Taichi]
"I won......"

I got the feeling that I'd won for the first time in a while.
Now then, let's go to school.

[Youko]
"......at......least......the be......ntou......"

She held fast to me.
She tried to hand me a paper bag with teary eyes.
I was urged on by a fair amount of guilt.

[Taichi]
"......I understand, I'll take it."

Are you my mother?
Not that I have a mother, but...

[Youko]
"See you later."

I'm thankful for it, but I couldn't honestly be happy.
