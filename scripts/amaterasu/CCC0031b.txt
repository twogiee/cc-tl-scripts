Miki and Kiri were there.

[Taichi]
"......do you have any food?"

[Miki]
"Unfortunately..."

[Taichi]
"What about that bentou......?"

Rice.
Meatballs.

[Taichi]
"H-hey...why do you have such things in a......?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin made them. She called it a rice box or something..."

[Taichi]
"Uwa, that's nice..."
(TL Note: Rice balls often contain dried plums and other things to add flavor, but meatballs are a very strange choice.)

[Kiri]
"......there's not enough for Sempai."

She said flatly.

[Taichi]
"Aren't there quite a few there?"

[Miki]
"There are a lot."

It seems quite clear that there are enough for three.

[Kiri]
"However, for some reason there aren't any for Sempai."

[Taichi]
"......muu..."

Innocence growled.

[Taichi]
"Then let's barter."

[Miki]
"You mean trade?"

[Taichi]
"Solid and gummy candies. Handmade."

Their eyes changed color.

[Miki]
"Handmade?"

[Taichi]
"Mmm. By Youko-chan though."
[Taichi]
"By the looks of things, these are low in sugar and are good for your looks. The gummies are made from konjac jelly. Zero calories."
//, but I guess it different according to each country's familiarity with Japanese food. - Raide

Both of them: "Zero calories!?"
........................

[Taichi]
"Yaaay."

Exchange accomplished.

[Miki]
"It has a mother's flavor......"
//Not sure exactly how you say this in English. 〜IX
//Changed it to how I think it is - Sheeta

[Kiri]
"Yes it does."

[Miki]
"It's milk chocolate."
//Technically, this is a total guess. No other conceivable meaning for "milk" made any sense in this context. 〜IX

[Kiri]
"It is..."

[Taichi]
"Though that's a stalker's flavor."

[Miki]
"My cheeks......my cheeks are......"

[Kiri]
"Nnnnnnn!"

They are girls...
Thanks to that I had rice.
I am, after all, Japanese.

[Taichi]
"Delicious......Kiri-chin has a talent for cooking."

[Kiri]
"......all I did was heat them up."

[Taichi]
"But they're delicious."

[Kiri]
"If I don't make them, Miki's going to eat sweets forever."

[Miki]
"I like sweets."

[Taichi]
"We both seem to be laboring over food."

[Miki]
"Yes......"

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, let's get married."

[Kiri]
"That's impossible."

[Miki]
"Not, 'I don't want to,' but, 'Impossible.' There you have it, Sempai."

[Taichi]
"......I'm on fire."

[Kiri]
"I'll throw water on you."

[Taichi]
"Again?"

[Miki]
"Are there any more sweets?"

[Taichi]
"There are. Cookies, sables and more. Youko-sensei is good at making sweets."
//Actually, the first word was not "cookie" but "biscuit." I felt it'd be overkill to have a tlnote explaining a confectionary Britishism. 〜IX

[Miki]
"Whoa, that's unexpected."
(TL Note: "Sable" is a French word for a kind of cookie with twice the normal portion of butter.)

[Taichi]
"They seem to keep well."

[Kiri]
"......is she...your lover?"

[Taichi]
"Eh? Me and Youko-chan?"

[Miki]
"Miki has also been interested in that."
[Miki]
"She makes no effort to eat well."

[Taichi]
"......aren't her cheeks stuffed?"

[Miki]
"Munch."

So spoke the girl storing up midsummer fat.
//The intent is that she's eating enough that she won't need to eat for a long time. Tell me if that got across. 〜IX
//Yep - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"Well, we did live together once."

[Miki]
"Cohabitation."

[Kiri]
"Cohabitation."
//Don't you love how this word is only two syllables in Japanese? 〜IX

They were stymied.

[Taichi]
"No, not the same as cohabitation."
[Taichi]
"Ummm, basically we had no parents, and Mutsumi-san adopted both of us. Ah, she's my guardian."
[Taichi]
"You could say we were like siblings, but......I don't think of it that way."

She doesn't think that way either.
That's why Youko-chan was chased out.

[Miki]
"Whoa, I never heard about this."

[Kiri]
"......I thought they had a suspicious relationship, but that was it......"

No, it actually is suspicious.

[Taichi]
"Well, about that, we're not blood relatives."

[Miki]
"Hasekura-sempai has many mysteries."

[Taichi]
"I couldn't agree more."
//Passage is too long, it goes more than six lines in-game - Raide

[Miki]
"Waa, thousand year candy!"
(TL Note: "Now...I have some special thousand-year candy here, so everyone get in the mood for the seven-five- three festival.")

Kiri took it from me.
(TL Note: One part of this festival is the "chitose-ame" or "thousand year candy," which symbolizes longevity for the children.))

[Miki]
"Uuooo, what are you doing!?"

[Kiri]
"You can't have sweets."

[Miki]
"But you ate them yourself!"

[Kiri]
"I eat real food too. From now on we have to manage our own health, right?"

[Miki]
"......wooow."

Hmmm.

[Kiri]
"What is it? You're staring at me with indecent eyes......"

[Taichi]
"Don't say 'indecent.'"
[Taichi]
"I only thought that you make a good combo."

[Miki]
"Since we're the flower-chans."

[Taichi]
"So much so that I want to make you debut."

[Miki]
"Though even if we debut now......"

[Kiri]
"At best the CD could only sell eight copies."

[Miki]
"A million would be a dream within a dream."

[Kiri]
"Then I'll buy two copies."

[Miki]
"Then I'll also buy two."

[Kiri]
"That makes ten."

[Miki]
"Yep, ten. Two digits."

She chuckled.
They really are intimate.
Their behavior refreshed me just a tiny bit.
