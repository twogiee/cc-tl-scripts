"............"

And now,
Just as Kiri said, the world is plain and clean.
I learned that humans can easily 『go away.』
It would've been nice if, not necessarily Adam and Eve, but if at least some slightly more perfect humans had lived through it.
Adam and Eve were originally created with the completeness to live on for all eternity, but after eating the fruit that belonged to the Tree of Knowledge, they were made incomplete as punishment.
Even so, it's recorded that they lived for a millennium.
Reading through the Bible, it's clear that the lifespans of their descendants shrank with each generation.
And now, the present day.
We were beginning to lose even our health.
What on Earth does God intend to do by pulling out all these wounded humans?
Including me......with all my dark emotions.
He must have thought that the world's going to keep turning anyway.
That nothing is irreparable.
Extreme Argument 1:
Even if I massacre everyone, everything will be reset.
On top of that, I'll lose my memory of it.
In a world without opportunities, there is only the amusement of possibilities.
That pleasure had been drawn out for me.
Desires raised their ugly heads.
Saying the game had begun.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, that's the place where Shinkawa Yutaka died."

Kiri wasn't surprised.
She slowly turned around.

[Taichi]
"?"

I was a little amazed that Kiri wasn't surprised.

[Kiri]
"......the world has become this......where people have disappeared......"
[Kiri]
"In exchange for the disappearance of malice......there's no longer any substance......"
//A good example of where truly using the literal ("density disappeared") would've ruined the scene. 〜IX
[Kiri]
"Even so, you didn't change, did you?"

[Taichi]
"............"

I was taken aback.
Her speech seemed almost belligerent.

[Kiri]
"......I've thought about saying this for a while."
[Kiri]
"Sempai, why are you still alive?"

A wedge was slammed into my heart.
『Hey, I have a question for you......why won't you go die already?』
They overlapped.
The past and present.
Crossing.
As if a knife I'd thrown a long time ago was now being unexpectedly thrown back at me.
An ironic composition.

[Kiri]
"Do you think you have the right to live?"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"You are...black."
//lol, hope no one thinks that's racist.-Spin

I felt that it was an accurate metaphor.

[Kiri]
"You're not a person. You're only something resembling a person. You're imitating a person. Like an insect."
[Kiri]
"You imitate, change into a person and attack people."
[Kiri]
"You are something that hurts people. You are incompatible with them."
[Kiri]
"A long time ago, the reason why your adaptation coefficient surpassed eighty was a mystery. But that's not the slightest bit strange. The part inside you that is a person is literally less than twenty percent."

She spoke loquaciously.
She's covering up the Sakura Kiri persona that she'd kept up until now, instead, constructing a more striking image.
//Persona sounds a lot better than just "style" since some people connote that too much with clothing.-Spin
The knife of her words had been trying to pierce my mind.
Until now she's only carried dull blades---
Now it was Sakura Kiri's trump card!

[Kiri]
"A monster."
[Kiri]
"You deceive by not acting completely like a monster, despite being no better than one."
[Kiri]
"Do you think sympathy can sprout between a person and a monster, such that they can live together all friendly and happily? Do you think you can obtain the happiness of a person?"
[Kiri]
"It's impossible."
[Kiri]
"The very little kindness in the world definitely will not be given to you. No, it must not be given to you."
[Kiri]
"It's the same as saying that no person holds love for the parasite that inhabits and eats away at their body. Even if there was, that person would be a lunatic."
[Kiri]
"You're always searching for prey to be sacrificed for your own ends. I understand. Until now that's been suppressed. But now that the world's become this, and people have dwindled, your suppression is no longer working."
[Kiri]
"Because you've lost the need to imitate us."
[Kiri]
"Your eyes always fall on us for the purpose of taking pleasure in hurting us. And without a single thought for us, you're trying to take your time ridiculing us as much as possible."
[Kiri]
"You're not a person, and you're not a monster."
[Kiri]
"So then, what are you? Something like you that isn't anyone or anything should have disappeared from this world. That's what I think."
[Kiri]
"Even the majority of humanity, filled with malice, had value far above that of your life. To me, they did."
[Kiri]
"I will give you two warnings."
[Kiri]
"First, if you're thinking that you can really become human through contacting others, you're mistaken. That's impossible. That thought profanes humans. I've never seen a monster as perfect as Sempai."
[Kiri]
"It is no exaggeration that you are a mentally deranged person. A lunatic among lunatics."
[Kiri]
"......the zenith of people who can go insane."
[Kiri]
"And one more: don't even think about laying your hands on us."
[Kiri]
"If Sempai approaches us, searching for a living sacrifice......"

Kiri drew out her last thrust.

[Kiri]
"I will shoot and kill you."

[Taichi]
"........................"

[Kiri]
"......I will absolutely not hand Miki over to you."
[Kiri]
"I won't let you destroy her!"

Her footsteps passed me in a straight line.
A creaking door. A closing door.
I became alone.

[Taichi]
"............monster......"

Monster.
Monster.
Monster.
I ruminated on that word, and ground my teeth.
Suffering.
This is the taste of my brain.
The brain secretes certain kinds of nerve transmissions, and those flavors ride directly along the nerves governing my sense of taste, causing this hallucination.
Monster.
Aptly similar to the word for when I show myself.

[Taichi]
"Owowow."

See, it hurts.
My parched heart shrank.
The countless shards piercing it continued to produce sharp pain.

[Taichi]
"She didn't......mince her words at all......"

I fell to my knees.
I stood up, dizzy.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, ow......ow, ow. It hurts, but..."

None of them are mortal wounds.
Kiri's knife had not effectively penetrated my heart.
It had only made small wounds on the surface.
There is pain, but,
It's mere child's play.
The 『attack』 I'd once received was nothing like this.
But I felt that it'd been a long time since I'd received an attack.
A moderate attack brings moderate stress.
A state close to drunkenness.
I lay down there.

[Taichi]
"......if you're going to shoot me......please do it......"
[Taichi]
"Please make it all better...ha♪"

I didn't feel too bad.
