Three hands overlapped.
One was mine.
One was Tomoki's.
One was Sakuraba's.
We weren't that close.
I had a certain history with Sakuraba.
Tomoki was a man lacking wit.
I was me, and for the first time, I had male friends.
I'd decided I couldn't form a relationship because we were all different human beings.
But I was wrong.
There are times when human beings fit well together because they're different.
The thing which tied the three of us together.
......that was Eros.
During the idle standby time of the club, Sakuraba suddenly blurted out,

[Sakuraba]
『Bloomers are nice.』

From that whispering bloomed the flower of friendship.
We were not the bloomer generation.
Which was precisely why were crazily yearning for that wonderful fetish clothing.
After all, spats are just boring.
And that is how---

[All three]
"Although the days in which we were born differ, we shall not wish for graduation (from school and from chastity) on the same day at the same time."

It was a vow to remain chaste until graduation.
No rushing ahead.
Actually, by this time I was already......
But, my soul remained a cherry.
No problem.
Afterward, it became clear that Sakuraba was slightly impotent and Tomoki was a siscon.
Everyone had problems of their own.
But, I didn't care.
The point was that we wanted to make a 『promise』.
We wanted to play the game of friendship.
We decided we would someday go to Peachland in commemoration of the loss ceremony.
There was also the opinion of the Matebook.
But that was no good.
Because my face was already cracking.
Our three hands kept overlapping, with no sign of separation.
Like this, we began mating.
