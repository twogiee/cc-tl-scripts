I rolled around in bed.
I'd like to finish cooking while it's light outside...
But I don't have the vigor.
Even though my wish is simple...
While relying on the captured notebooks......after three days......I couldn't regain a single connection.
Connection.
A club life where all the members of the Broadcasting Club would stand together.
A bright, fun, healthy radio broadcast.
The notebooks, naturally, don't record conclusions.
I can't determine which methods are close to the conclusion I desire.

[Taichi]
"Thursday, Friday, Saturday......"

How many days are left?
It would have been better not to know.
That the world would end.

[Taichi]
"Uuuu......"

I moaned softly.
That was my resentment with this mysterious world, and the present irritating reality.
At best, three or four days.

[Taichi]
"What can I do......in that little time..."

I clenched my fist.
The shaky undulation of my seething emotions heated my body, much like rage.
How long---
........................
............
......
I took action.
With the descriptions in the notebooks as reference, I took the optimal actions in each situation.
For the sake of happiness.
For the sake of building unity.
Friends, friendship, bonds.
For the sake of those transparent things.
And then a useless day came to an end.
Even this bit of hypocrisy was unable to gain---
........................
............
......
It became Friday.
Normally, this is when changes occur in each person's relationships.
But since I continued on with beauties on all sides, I ended up wasting away my time without gaining anything.
With Mimi-sempai, with Touko, with Kiri, with Miki......
The sense of distance between us remained despairingly far.
........................
I ran around for half a day without result.

[Taichi]
"Haa."

I was tired.
I sat down at the front gate. It darkened as I did, so that time was only one step away from becoming evening.
Then, a familiar intimate rustling in my skin sensed approachment from a great distance.
It's Youko-chan.
That's rare, for her to be this defenseless.

[Youko]
"......is there something I can help with?"

She said, standing in front of me.

[Taichi]
"No, not right now......"

Even though I brushed that off, I asked her something despite myself.
A drowning heart will cling to even a piece of straw.

[Taichi]
"Hey......what can I do to make things go well with everyone?"
[Taichi]
"Have everyone friendly and participating in Mimi-sempai's club, be appropriately youthful, make jokes, laugh......isn't there a route like that?"
[Taichi]
"Where we can resolve quarrels, respect each other and have hope......"
[Taichi]
"Have friendly fights, check the broadcast script with everyone, cooperate to deal with trouble......"
[Taichi]
"Isn't there one?"

Perhaps, she might just know.
I held a faint hope.

[Youko]
"I don't think so."

[Taichi]
"......"

Her flat voice sounded colder than usual.

[Youko]
"I don't think there's such a possibility anywhere."
[Youko]
"In order for Taichi to manage to bring everyone back together to the club safely, in this situation, in this world......you'd have to have more time, or a better starting situation."
[Youko]
"Taichi has neither of those."
[Youko]
"There are absolute limits."
[Youko]
"That's why I think it's useless no matter how much you try."

[Taichi]
"......I see."

She'd told me flat out that there were none.

[Taichi]
"It's not fair to say this sort of thing, but......that's a cold equation you have there."

She didn't answer.
She stood still and waited for my words.

[Taichi]
"Aren't I starting from a broken situation every time?"
[Taichi]
"To end without having achieved anything......to loop......to have a minimum number of days each week......"
[Taichi]
"What kind of joke is this?"

I held my head.
There was nothing to satiate the hunger in my heart.

[Youko]
"Taichi......those aren't all of the notebooks."

She suddenly opened her mouth.

[Taichi]
"What did you say?"

[Youko]
"There are notebooks which chronicle more ruinous timelines and possibilities."

[Taichi]
"And they are?"

[Youko]
"......I hid them."
[Youko]
"So that you wouldn't be hurt."
[Youko]
"Or perhaps......so you wouldn't give up."
[Youko]
"......do you want to see them?"

[Taichi]
"......"

Ruinous timelines......

[Youko]
"However you struggle, however you fight,"
[Youko]
"Within the many and varied possibilities, there isn't a single person......who will understand you."
[Youko]
"Except for me."
[Youko]
"......I think it's about time you understood that."

[Taichi]
"I do understand that."
[Taichi]
"If we're tacking that on...there's no way you'll love me either, is there!?"

I screamed.

[Taichi]
"What the hell is this world!?"

I spat out a deep breath.
Along with frustration.

[Taichi]
"Hey......is this a different world?"

Youko-chan stood in front of me.
And with her fingernails, she drew an 『Ｘ』 in the ground.

[Youko]
"There are two possibilities."
[Youko]
"One is, the axes of two linear worlds are mingling, and have fallen into a state where they can perceive each other......like in sci-fi."

Two worlds.
Twisting around and crossing.

[Taichi]
"So when the worlds overlap, abnormalities occur?"
[Taichi]
"Nn......in that case, what about the world we used to be in? I can't imagine we're all preserved there---"

[Youko]
"The other is, that this is the conclusion of the world we were in."

But she denied only half of the easy salvation.

[Taichi]
"............"
[Taichi]
"Intervening with our other-world brethren is impossible......I would think, based on quantum mechanics."

When it come to quantum mechanics, I think of Dirac, but I've never read his work.
Besides, I don't know whether this situation is fitting for a quantum mechanical interpretation.

[Taichi]
"......about the sci-fi you mentioned earlier......what did that mean?"

[Youko]
"Let's say you have to choose either A or B. Which will it be?"

[Taichi]
"......half of each I guess. Since I don't know what they are."

[Youko]
"Yes. We live upon innumerable daily choices."
[Youko]
"For example, when you start walking, with which leg will you take first step?"
[Youko]
"Which part of your lunch will you eat first?"
[Youko]
"Choices occur in an even more microscopic world."
[Youko]
"At any given moment, countless choices take place."
[Youko]
"The world is made by those choices."
[Youko]
"And those choices are irreversible."

[Taichi]
"Irreversible......"

[Youko]
"For example, if Taichi chooses A. Taichi will be aware that he chose A."
[Youko]
"But at the same time, in that same world axis there also exists a Taichi that chose B."
[Youko]
"That doesn't mean that parallel worlds exist, but......"
[Youko]
"But at the very least, in Dirac's theory, it's impossible to perceive Choice B World from Choice A World. And vice versa."
[Youko]
"But if one could perceive, then one could move in the space between worlds."
[Youko]
"For one who can see ultraviolet rays, it's like the world is a completely different thing."
[Youko]
"One who was able to observe multiple worlds could also exist in both of those worlds."
[Youko]
"The moment one succeeds at observing, they become part of that world......or so we think."

[Taichi]
"They......observed......?"
[Taichi]
"You mean the world doesn't change, it's just mistakes by those who see it?"

[Youko]
"Something like that."
[Youko]
"But in modern theory, multiple world observation is impossible."
[Youko]
"And besides, that wouldn't be enough of a reason for the multiple us's to move as one."
[Youko]
"That's why I said sci-fi."

[Taichi]
"......hmm."
[Taichi]
"What about the second possibility?"

[Youko]
"I think that that's the truth."
[Youko]
"Which means other worlds aren't being observed."

[Taichi]
"......nnn, so that sci-fi interpretation is out."

My upright face nodded.

[Youko]
"The world, time and proper history. They're all continuous."
[Youko]
"Which means......time isn't rolling back."

[Taichi]
"......eh?"
[Taichi]
"That can't be right. The diaries record from Monday to Saturday......don't we all return to Monday from there?"

[Youko]
"It only looks as if it's looping."
[Youko]
"Of course the world isn't repeating the same time forever."
[Youko]
"This conclusion was the world's final conclusion."
[Youko]
"Worlds aren't crossing. No abnormalities are occurring. Continuous. Besides, if the world allowed such possibilities, then we've followed a possibility that brought us here instead."
[Youko]
"It may look as if perceptions of multiple worlds are mingling, but it's actually just continuing along one unbroken path."

[Taichi]
"It looks like it's looping......but it's actually us that are being reset over and over......"
[Taichi]
"In the first place, there was never any loop-like phenomenon in our original world......"

I realized.
That's right.

[Taichi]
"We can't be aware of it......"

We normally can't be aware of a loop occurring.
As long as a peculiar place like the hokora doesn't exist.
The phenomenon definitely won't be exposed.

[Taichi]
"Was the world originally planned with this loop phenomenon in mind? To go with the twilight of humanity?"

At the end of a long road...
An annihilation without the land breaking down.
Spacetime is scattered, and the ability to continue forward......so that's where we go to die.

[Taichi]
"But......you know......"

[Youko]
"With the specific condition......that when one arrives at the prescribed time on Sunday, the world is disintegrated once......that's all it could be."
[Youko]
"Obeying spatially recorded information, the disintegrated particles converge and return to their state from Monday morning."

[Taichi]
"But, for the world to be continuous......"

[Youko]
"We have that Shinto shrine as proof."
[Youko]
"The contents recorded in the notebooks show the existence of the past."
[Youko]
"Since we can observe a past, there is a past."
[Youko]
"That past is allowed by this world."
[Youko]
"And we are here now after being disintegrated and reconstructed over and over."
[Youko]
"......strictly speaking, I feel as if we're not people any more."

[Taichi]
"Then what are we?"

[Youko]
"Phenomena."

That overly apt word stained my heart.
No longer people---

[Taichi]
"You may support the unbroken theory, but the first one sounded better to me. Not that we can determine which is correct right now......"

[Youko]
"Even if it looks to us like a loop, there's no way to investigate what's actually happening."
[Youko]
"......so for now, we can only make use of the theories we have."
[Youko]
"At present, I think it's impossible to move between worlds, so we'll suppose the latter."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, I see......"

The multiple worlds theory found in quantum mechanics does not support the existence of parallel worlds.
Since that would be a mistake, what's actually happening would be a more definite thought experiment.
In it, even if World A and World B exist at the same time, we can't come and go between them.
The reason is that they exist at the same time.
Around here, it becomes a little troublesome to understand.

[Taichi]
"If one of Dirac's books had been translated, I would've read it, but..."

[Youko]
"Even if we deviate from all the theories thus far,"
[Youko]
"Something we thought couldn't occur has occurred. That's all."
[Youko]
"The scope is physically vast, and people have yet to spread across all of it."
[Youko]
"So for us now, those theories are trivial things."
[Youko]
"What do we need?"

[Taichi]
"I don't know."

[Youko]
"Isn't it someone who understands?"

She smiled.

[Taichi]
"............"

[Youko]
"There's someone who understands Taichi right here."
[Youko]
"No one else will understand you."
[Youko]
"The more you mimic, the more......"

That's right.
It's obvious.
If I pretend to be human, that pretending will become myself.
If my hidden inner side is seen, I'm finished.
/ It makes more sense this way, and a following line says "When my inner self suddenly appeared" -Shikiller
I remember.

[Taichi]
"I already know......that much."
[Taichi]
"I've known ever since then!"

[Yuusa]
"This is a nice room."

Doujima Yuusa.
She was a good girl.
Innocent and healthy,
Even if she hides her sickness inside, she doesn't know how to hurt people.

[Yuusa]
"Umm...I don't understand this transformation......"

In my eyes, sweet water.

[Yuusa]
"......Taichi-san?"

The end of one's life is sudden.
When my inner self suddenly appeared, she found it highly poisonous.

[Yuusa]
"Taichi......san......is that you?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, that's right."

[Yuusa]
"Uh, umm......I...I......"

[Taichi]
"You're beautiful."

My eyes must have been shining.
Flashing with desire.

[Taichi]
"Because you're beautiful, I'll take your clothes off."

[Yuusa]
"............"

You'd understand if you've ever been gazed at by a wild carnivorous animal.
Bloodshot eyes paying attention to you.
Neither goodwill nor malice.
A shockingly hot gaze......appetite.
Eyes looking at your human self, recognizing it only as food.
An ardent appetite poured into you.
At times it must make you want to puke.
Like it did her.

[Yuusa]
"N-......nooooooooo!!!"
[Yuusa]
"......dis......gusting......!"
[Yuusa]
"Uu......uuu......"

As I looked down at the girl crouching and vomiting, I was sick and tired of that boring conclusion.
A girl who broke before I got to break her.

[Taichi]
"............"

And then, she started to avoid me.
She looked at me as if I was garbage.
I actually was garbage.
I was---
........................

[Youko]
"If they stay, they'll only get hurt."
[Youko]
"They're no more than Taichi's food."

[Taichi]
"Shut up! I said I understand!"

Youko-chan went quiet.

[Taichi]
"But if I could, I wouldn't......do that......I don't want to do that......"
[Taichi]
"It should work out somehow......"

[Youko]
"I'm the only one that should stay."

She pushed on her chest.

[Youko]
"Because Taichi and I would work well together."

Black emotions hung over my lower abdomen.
CSQ 0 1 1
  -Throw myself at her
  -Hold back
