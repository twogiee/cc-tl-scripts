A sea bath......
It wasn't too great for Miki, but that trip was a memory.
Memories make the heart richer.
That's why I said this.

[Taichi]
"I know you don't like it, but would you try coming to the club tomorrow?"
//Old line ruined the mood.-Spin

[Touko]
"......eh?"

She raised her gaze with an expression of perplexity and indecision.
//Apparently, there's a difference between raise and rise.-Spin
Those haggard features took on a shade of scarlet, giving an impression both brave and tragic.

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

It's nighttime, so I'm writing the manuscript.
I'm not making good progress right now.
Ordinary content.
But, right now I have to keep going.

[Taichi]
"It's lacking in panache..."

That's right.
I'll have Sempai look at this.
There's no time like the present.
I left my house right away.
Sempai's house.
I tried knocking, but there was no answer.

[Taichi]
"Sempaaai!"

Still no response.

[Taichi]
"Your Taichi has come!"

*silence*
Maybe she's not in.

[Taichi]
"......"

Could she possibly still be at school?

[Taichi]
"Uwaa, she's here!"

[Misato]
"Wa! Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"You're overdoing it!"

[Misato]
"I-I'm sorry."

[Taichi]
"Haa."

As one would expect, she appeared to have been constructing the antenna.

[Taichi]
"How can you even get work done when it's this dark?"

[Misato]
"I was just worried about it......is that bad?"

[Taichi]
"It's bad."
[Taichi]
"If you've got the time to do that, please look at this manuscript."

[Misato]
"Oya, you're done already?"

[Taichi]
"Only partly. But I want your opinion."

[Misato]
"Aaah, but it's dark right now......so I can't read it."

[Taichi]
"That's true."
[Taichi]
"Forget it then, let's go home."

[Misato]
"Ah, but......just a little longer."

[Taichi]
"Mimi-sempai......"

[Misato]
"Buuutttt..."

[Taichi]
"Nothing will be gained from rushing this."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"You should be taking your time. Right?"
[Taichi]
"There's loads of time."
[Taichi]
"If you hurry it along......it'll just end that much sooner."
[Taichi]
"Sempai, would you be able to handle that?"

[Misato]
"......!"

She seemed ready to cry.
My back went numb.
I just realized I'd run my mouth off into a taboo.

[Misato]
"......I've...been running away, haven't I?"

[Taichi]
"That's right."

[Misato]
"You were...able to see that?"

[Taichi]
"I was."
[Taichi]
"You're running away, by devoting yourself to your work."
//Hmmm......It would be much appreciated if no one cited this as evidence I need professional help. ã€œIX
//This phrase is almost too familiar. I think he's talking about Ixrec. Or... me ;_; -Neko

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"Forcing yourself to keep working......in a way that intentionally increases the workload."

[Misato]
"......so you saw through me?"

[Taichi]
"I thought that was normal."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"What Sempai is doing...I don't think it's that strange."
[Taichi]
"There's no such thing as a person who hasn't fled from something."
[Taichi]
"But to have to flee so desperately like you are, Sempai......it's painful."
[Taichi]
"My heart can't take it."

[Misato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"You......should've passed thirty by now."

[Misato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Severe Self-Injurious Behavior."

[Misato]
"............"

The silence of assent.
I just piled on more words.

[Taichi]
"Working on your own is fine, but if you're being chased into a corner......individually devoting yourself like this is dangerous."
[Taichi]
"......when you finally lose it...it'll be dangerous, since this is the roof after all."
[Taichi]
"Do you understand?"

[Misato]
"I do...understand."

She said, as if alone.

[Taichi]
"I've been really worried."

Sempai took off her glasses.
She brushed the back of her finger along her tear-filled eyes.

[Misato]
"I've been so unstable......I made Peke-kun worry about me."

[Taichi]
"Haha......that's a rude way to put it."

[Misato]
"Ahaha."
[Misato]
"I'm surprised to hear that from you."

I wiped her tears.

[Misato]
"......thank you."

[Taichi]
"Don't mention it."

[Misato]
"But......everyone's split up now......it's like the club's evaporating."

[Taichi]
"I'm not evaporating."

[Misato]
"But, you......your motives seem impure."

She found out.

[Taichi]
"Well..."

[Misato]
"But it's true that I might have been obstinate."

[Taichi]
"Besides, strictly speaking you weren't alone, were you?"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

I showed her the wrapped object I picked up under the water tower just a moment ago.

[Misato]
"Snacks?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."
[Taichi]
"But the inside is curry bread."

[Misato]
"............ah."

She noticed that and covered her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Lately, she's been pretty nervous, and won't show her face much."
[Taichi]
"That idiot can't stand watching her friends get cornered."
[Taichi]
"So she just brings this curry bread."

[Misato]
"But Peke-kun seems happy about it."

[Taichi]
"Are you going to eat it?"

Sempai nodded slightly.
Together, we ate the curry bread.
