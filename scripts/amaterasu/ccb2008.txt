And thus, we went to the Kirihara estate.

[Touko]
"It's just this for now."
//Don't want to make her seem like she's showing off.-Spin

Just this.
That's what she said.
There were three bicycle trailers there.
We pulled them along with the Kirihara's huge RV.
I can drive this.
I've studied it in racing manga.
......there's a big difference between watching and doing.
A lot happened, but let's just say Touko was traumatized.
She said she'd never get in a car with me again.
I felt the same way.
Wooow, I am so glad we had our seat belts on.
Anyway, 『We got the car to around the vicinity of the Kurosu residence』, after that we should've just carried the stuff.
//It's refering to how they ran out of gas right?-Spin
//Since you said it might be about a crash, this should fit better then.-Spin
The distance was only a few hundred meters, after all.
Touko and I searched the trailer.
I guess because Touko's a noblewoman, she thought that these bicycle trailers were covered women's bikes. So, as the poor people's local representative, I fondled her breasts with a vengeance.
I got punched. It was a good thing.
So we made three round trips with the trailers I'd found.
We were dead tired.
Then Touko's words beat me up even further.
//Sounds better in context IMO - pondrthis
Her first words upon entering my room were:

[Touko]
"......what's with this storeroom?"

Then I lost all strength and broke down to the floor.
//While I like "to", I feel obligated to suggest "on" as an alternative. - pondrthis
//I can go either way. Your call Ixrec.-Spin
