When I got to the classroom, there was no one there.
Not even Touko, who was always sitting sullenly in her seat.

[Taichi]
"Now then,"

I took out the manuscript paper from my book bag.
I'd finished it in one night.
I'll go get it okayed right away.
To the roof.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

She met me with a suspicious gaze.

[Taichi]
"Oya, president."
[Taichi]
"For what reason are you guarding your chest?"

[Misato]
"......that's......"

Her face turned red.

[Misato]
"Umm, yesterday, I don't remember it very well."

[Taichi]
"I'm not surprised."

[Misato]
"I-I couldn't have...?"

[Taichi]
"Wh-what is it?"

I played dumb.

[Misato]
"............"

She looked down, and agonized.
But the arms covering her chest wouldn't waver by an iota.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, let's go over here."

I grabbed Sempai's wrist and pulled.

[Misato]
"Kyawa!!?"

Sempai screamed hastily.

[Misato]
"Stoooooop!"

[Taichi]
"He?"

[Misato]
"Suke......"

[Taichi]
"Suke?"

[Misato]
"Suke, suke......"
(TL Note: "Sukebe" means "lecher.")
[Misato]
"Sukeepugooto."

[Taichi]
"Scapegoat."

In my head, I thought of a single goat in a grassy field.

[Misato]
"I don't want to be a scapegoat."

[Taichi]
"Neither would I."

[Misato]
"We have to be careful about that."

[Taichi]
"Haa."
[Taichi]
"But I didn't want to make Sempai into a scapegoat; I only wanted to move you into the shade."

[Misato]
"Ah, that's right. Then let's do that."

She's loosening up.
We moved.

[Taichi]
"By the way Sempai, you were drinking sake yesterday."

[Misato]
"Ah, eh, aaah."
[Misato]
"......I'm sorry."

Her body withered.

[Taichi]
"It was troublesome."

[Misato]
"You don't mean I......was drunk and......did something extreme?"

Yes, she's hooked.

[Taichi]
"Yes, you were putting on such a shameless performance that I cannot speak of it."

[Misato]
"-!?"

Sempai's eyes became a 『×』 stretched horizontally.
She was completely lost for words.

[Misato]
"Aaaah!!"

[Taichi]
"But fear not. I dealt with it in such a manner that no one saw a thing."

[Misato]
"......aah, so that's what happened......thank you very much."

Sempai lowered her head, leaving one matter untouched.

[Misato]
"But, I...exactly what kind of unseemly......?"

[Taichi]
"Do you want to know?"

[Misato]
"......"

Hesitation.

[Taichi]
"Are you going to take responsibility for it?"

[Misato]
"What?"

This time her eyes turned into dots.

[Taichi]
"I mean, if I tell you, will you feel like doing that?"

[Misato]
"Hawawawa."

[Taichi]
"Oh no, if you think about it calmly, it's no big deal."

[Misato]
"Is...is that true?"

[Taichi]
"Do you want to know?"

Sempai thought about it with crossed eyes for a fairly long time.

[Misato]
"............yes."

[Taichi]
"It wasn't really a big deal, but-"
[Taichi]
"Using the antenna's wiring over there, you put on a naked ribbon dance, facing this way so I could take pic-"

[Misato]
"I'm finished."

She collapsed with a soft thud.

[Misato]
"To whom it may concern, how might we deign to spend our days after my spring hibernation......"

She read aloud a fictional letter.
(TL Note: "Spring hibernation" is a euphemism for the tendency to frequently oversleep during spring.)

[Taichi]
"Sempai, get a grip."

[Misato]
"......I never thought my life could reach an even lower low......"

[Taichi]
"I dealt with it skillfully, so-"

[Misato]
"On top of that......my bra......"

[Taichi]
"You mean, it hath not returned home?"

Sempai nodded silently.

[Taichi]
"Then, right now......you're as you were when you woke up?"

Again, a nod.

[Taichi]
"Then,"

I swallowed.
Right now, Sempai is,
Under that thin, nearly see-through shirt,
Nake-...naked!!!
Underrrrrrr her clothesssss she's nakedddddddd!!
......wait, come to think of it, all the girlies of the world are naked under their clothes.
Well, the point is......she's bra-less.
And Sempai's are large.
And her shirt is tight, so they stand out.
I get it, that's why she's acting weird.

[Taichi]
"For now, why not go home and take a shower?"

[Misato]
"Do I smell bad?"
[Misato]
"I did wipe myself down with the school's water......"

Ah, what a nice stew...
If I'd woken up sooner maybe I would've chanced upon it.
Why can't I get swept into events like that?
That's simply unacceptable. I'm a failure as an eero.
*eero = Taichian for a heroic being with erotic behavior.

[Taichi]
"Sempai, please leave it to me."

[Misato]
"?"

I returned to the classroom.
I took out a sports towel from my belongings.

[Taichi]
"Will this work as a substitute?"

I held it out.

[Misato]
"Peke-kuuun."

Sempai was moved to the point of tears.

[Taichi]
"That's bleached cotton, right? If you put this in, I think it'll at least be harder to see through."

[Misato]
"You're such a good boy......"

As tears welled up, she took the towel.

[Misato]
"Please wait just a moment. If you move I'll __ you."

[Taichi]
"Yeees."

Sempai took shelter nearby.
I feel like I want to be __'ed, but I'll let it go.

[Taichi]
"......"

What kind of __ could it be...
Maybe, she's going to __ the tip of my rod with the two wild strawberries at the tips of her breasts......

[Taichi]
"Aaaaah, you idiot! Idiot! Idiot! I'm an idiot!"

A few minutes later.

[Misato]
"Yaa, Peke-kun, good morning!!!"

She reappeared with an absurdly bright face.
And with her breasts covered.

[Misato]
"Today's another summer day. It looks like this heat isn't going away anytime soon."

[Taichi]
"I...I couldn't agree more."

[Misato]
"So, what are you up to this morning?"

[Taichi]
"I've come to deliver the manuscript you requested from me yesterday."

[Misato]
"Manuscript? You wrote a script for our pilot broadcast?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, that's amazing. I had no idea you would do such a thing."

Her expression was filled with goodwill and admiration.

[Taichi]
"It was nothing, really..."

I twisted like a bread roll.

[Misato]
"Do you mind if I see it?"

[Taichi]
"Here doth it be."

[Misato]
"Then,"

I passed her the manuscript paper.
Sempai's eyes became stricter than usual.
Her gaze ran lightly across the page.

[Taichi]
"......"

In no time at all,
Sempai raised her head.
A full smile. If I were to compare it to something......the Holy Mother.
The Holy Mother's heavenly light.
With a halo over her, she spoke.

[Misato]
"Rejected."

[Taichi]
"Waffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!"

Through the fence, I cried out to the town.

[Taichi]
"I'll resubmit it......"

[Misato]
"I'll be waiting."

I shuffled back indoors.

[Taichi]
"Ah, right, right, please be sure to return that towel without washing it."

[Misato]
"What?"

At the moment Sempai tilted her head,
The various building materials propped up around her slowly began to move.

[Taichi]
"OH! Dangerous!"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

I won't make it!
Stepladder, needles, tools......all of those things,
All rained down on Sempai.
Rained down---

[Misato]
"......nnn......"

Sempai woke up.

[Taichi]
"Thank goodness......you're unhurt......I was worried."

[Misato]
"Didn't I...?"

[Taichi]
"Hic, thank God it wasn't anything serious......"
[Taichi]
"Nee-san."

[Misato]
"Incorrect."

[Taichi]
"That hurts."

She'd returned to normal, and said,

[Misato]
"Please tell me what happened."

[Taichi]
"Sempai got injured."
[Taichi]
"I did first aid and carried you here."
[Taichi]
"Then, just now, you woke up."

[Misato]
"I...got injured?"

[Taichi]
"Just a little."

[Misato]
"Ummm......?"

Sempai touched every part of her body.
Bandages were wrapped around her arms.
Medical tape was stretched across various parts of her body.

[Misato]
"Ow-ow-ow-ow, I hurt all over......"

[Taichi]
"You have light bruises all over your body."

[Misato]
"......I'm so careless."

[Taichi]
"But thankfully, it's nothing serious."

[Misato]
"......thank you, Peke-kun, for calling to me."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Now, back to the club......"

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey, don't move."

I pushed her back down.

[Misato]
"Why shouldn't I?"

[Taichi]
"Fundamentally, it's no big deal, but......"

I gently pulled up the sheets, then her skirt,
Exposing her bare thighs. Bare...thighs...

[Misato]
"........................"

[Taichi]
"See, right here on your bare thighs, you've got a small cut. So you should take the day off from club......"

[Misato]
"Hafu, hafu."

Her mouth opened and closed like a fish.

[Taichi]
"Uwa, blood's oozing out."

Blood.

[Taichi]
"May I change your bandages?"

She nodded mechanically.
I brought new bandages over and changed them.

[Taichi]
"Not to change the subject, but,"
[Taichi]
"You have sexy legs."

[Misato]
"I'll do it myself."

[Taichi]
"Eh, no you can't. Please leave it to me."

[Misato]
"No...please let me......"

[Taichi]
"But,"

I looked at her thighs.
Blood oozed out.
Not good.

[Taichi]
"But,"

Such pretty blood...
Is flowing out of her...
Red blood.
Red. Red.
I felt dizzy, and closed my eyes.
Then opened them.
Aaah......
The world's always vague.
Everything that stirs will turn red with just a touch.
Simple. It's a simple thing.
All my senses were strengthened, and I became able to see the invisible.
The range of the visible light spectrum changed.
My vision became indistinctly hazy, and I became highly sensitive to motion.
I abruptly forgot what I was.
The sensation of my consciousness switching.
I moved.
My sense of being was vague.
Some part of me knew that I was not myself.
A red spot in the center of my range of vision.
I tried to approach it.
Static.
There seems to have been some kind of phenomenon.
I don't know the details.
My body can't sense them.
I had joined with the world, and that feeling of omnipotence became everything.
Static.
Just what is this?
Something heterogeneous in the world.
A red spot.
Aaah.
Aaah, I get it.
I've been erring.
That which I could see had been unilaterally designated as my daily life.
But that wasn't actually true.
That contradiction brought about constriction and innovation within my range of vision.
The beast who'd attained understanding of his role fidgeted from delight.
A beast who constructed instincts which follow rules, impulses and groupings contrary to the present age.

[Taichi]
"wwwﾍ√ﾚvvwwﾍ√~~"

I produced a sound.
Static.
This is......what?
Strain your consciousness.
Take it in.
Unravel it.
Interpret it.
Define it.
That's it.
This is sound.
The same kind of wave my own mouth formed.
My consciousness converged. Now that I knew it was sound, it could be quickly translated.
***********
Mi**********
Misato**ke***n?*

[Misato]
"Pe*...**n?"
[Misato]
"Peke...*kun?"
[Misato]
"Peke......kun?"

Aah, now I see.
Miyasumi Misato.
It's Sempai.
Sempai's words.
Sempai's red.

[Misato]
『You're always alone, aren't you?』

That's why,

[Misato]
『Why don't we start a club together?』

Attacking is prohibited.

[Taichi]
"Get away!!!"

[Misato]
"Wa!"

My vision cleared up.

[Taichi]
"............nnn."

I had a headache.

[Taichi]
"Of all the-......"

This timing...
The combination of blood and the evening sun really isn't good.
I feel like crying.

[Taichi]
"My, my, isn't this troublesome? Wahaha."

[Misato]
*sobbing*

My Venus, Sempai, had been crying.

[Taichi]
"Who did this!? Whatever bastard made Sempai cry, show yourself!!"

I took an empty-fisted stance.

[Taichi]
"I'll make you taste my karade!"

[Misato]
*sobbing*
(TL Note: "Karade" is probably Taichi's misreading of the kanji for "Karate.")

[Taichi]
"Sempai, who did this to you!?"

Sempai pointed at me.

[Taichi]
"Surmounting oneself is as hard as writing 'self-denial'!!!"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun? Peke-kun?"
(TL Note: Two jokes in one: 'surmount' and 'self-denial' are written with the same pair of kanji, and those kanji are very easy to write, totaling a mere ten strokes.)

[Taichi]
"Ah......yes?"

[Misato]
"Ah, you're back to the normal Peke-kun......"

[Taichi]
"I am the Taichi who shalt be your prince of love for perpetuity."

I knelt before her.

[Taichi]
"Have you need of my karade?"

[Misato]
"I don't care about your 'karade' or whatever incomprehensible martial art......"
[Misato]
"Just now, Peke-kun, you were like a robotian, and I was scared."

*Robotian = Misatoan for a robot with a will.

[Taichi]
"You mean a Taichibot?"

[Misato]
"Something like that."

[Taichi]
"I was deranged."

[Misato]
"......are you all right now?"

She couldn't make any complicated jokes right now.

[Taichi]
"Yes, as my dual booted OS change ended quickly,"

[Misato]
"I heard from Hashisaki-sensei that Peke-kun's English grades were horrible."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, Sempai, we need to hurry and stop the bleeding."
(TL Note: Most of Japan's words relating to computers are borrowed directly from English. Taichi just used about six such loanwords at once.)
