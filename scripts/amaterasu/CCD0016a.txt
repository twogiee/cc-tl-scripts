[Kiri]
"......stare."

Kiri was staring me down as I brushed off the dust.

[Taichi]
"Kiri......"

So, Kiri first.

[Kiri]
"......what is it?"

A cold reaction with cold features.
She stood before me.
I was a head taller than her, but she faced me with an unhesitating gaze.
That's good spirit.

[Taichi]
"Teyaaa."

*akesukeee!*

[Kiri]
"---???"
[Kiri]
"H-huh? Huhuh?"
[Kiri]
"Wh-why won't it go back......wh-wh-wha!?"

Kiri pushed down on her fluttering skirt.
That didn't calm it down in the slightest.

[Kiri]
"My skirt! It's......floating, wait, what is this!?"

[Miki]
"Mystery discovered......"

[Taichi]
"The trick is in how you twist your wrist."

[Kiri]
"Aa-aa-aaaa-aaaaa......"

*fluster* *fluster*
*flutter* *flutter* *flap* *flap*

[Kiri]
"Ku, I can't get the air out!"

[Taichi]
"Now..."

I looked at Miki.

[Miki]
"Gulp......"

[Taichi]
"I have a slightly early Christmas present for a little girl who loves mini skirts."

[Miki]
"Ah......are...you going to do that to me too......?"

She tried to back out.

[Miki]
"Ah......no......please forgive meee."

[Taichi]
"Uu."

Ku, she's so tender.

[Taichi]
"I would much prefer to let you go, but...... forgive me."

[Miki]
"Fuwaa, Se-sempai, calm down......"

I placed my fingers on the hem of her skirt.

[Miki]
"Miki's beloved Sempai would never do such a thing, would he?"

She gazed at me.

[Taichi]
"......"

The girl's cry moved my heart.
I want to push recklessly into the back of those hips.
I want to break her because I adore her.
I want to harass her because I love her.
A man's heart is complicated.

[Miki]
"Why do people have to fight each other!?"

Ku! So true...
That's a completely unrelated and correct question.
Miki's pure words opened my eyes.

[Taichi]
"I understand, Miki."

[Miki]
"Sempai, thank goodness."

I lowered my head to Kiri as well.

[Taichi]
"Well, well, Kiri, sorry!"

[Kiri]
"Sorry's not good enough!!!"
