Kiri should be trying to catch me off guard.
In the cafeteria and on the roof, I noticed her sooner than she hoped.
That's why she didn't attack.
......I think it'll be easy to lure her in.
I entered the bathroom.
When I left, I felt killing intent for a moment......but it soon faded.
I walked slowly down the hallway.
I don't think she'll keep preparing to attack over and over.
She should set something up,
In a more surefire place.
......nothing happened in the hallway.
Today was hot.
I felt like going to the beach.
Come to think of it, we all went there together last year.
The beach was fun.
Even now, I can remember everyone frolicking around.

[Touko]
"Kiaaa!!? Where are you grabbing on to!!?"

[Taichi]
"The part of your swimsuit covering your butt."

[Misato]
"Hasekura-san......just what kind of relationship does she have with Kurosu-kun?"

[Taichi]
"Nn? Youko-chan?"

[Touko]
"Youko-chan!?"

[Misato]
"Youko-chan!!?"

[Miki]
"Youko-chan!!!?"

[Tomoki]
"Youko-chan!!?"

[Miki]
"Now you're the yakuza."

[Misato]
"No-not my body..."

[Yuusa]
"Ummm, excuse, excuse, excuse, me!!!!!"

[Touko]
"Iiidiot."

[Yuusa]
"Ah! Spin! Spinning!?"

[Miki]
"Ow, owwww, my forehead hurts..."

[Misato]
......*muttering*

[Taichi]
"But it was fun."

Our fun sea bath ended there.
Miki's wound left a very small scar.
Even so, she was bright and cheerful on the way home.
As if she'd gained something through being hurt.
It was that kind of face.
Afterward, Misato-sempai returned to school to help carry the Broadcasting Club's newly delivered antenna.
Tomoki, who still hadn't broken off relations with his sister, said something sarcastic.
That siscon behavior of his was made fun of by Miki ever since, even into their third year at Gunjou.
Yuusa-chan, for the first time, opened her heart a little toward a group of other people.
That's what the beach meant to us.
......and yet, that unity had broken down to the point where we were killing each other.
My heart shook.
Why did it turn out like this?
I couldn't contain my irritation.
Thus,
I thought that everything should just go away.
Afterward, I wandered about the town to kill time.
There was no attack.
She's a weakling.
So,
I returned.
Not being in a familiar space might actually be a hardship.
Aaah, however,
Just what am I doing?
No one's here.
Not that long ago, Touko was here.
Touko, who never renewed her conduct even after people disappeared.
......though she had been desperately fighting with self-reliance.

[Taichi]
"I know you don't like it, but would you try coming to the club tomorrow?"

I had a soliloquy.
I had been planning to say that if Touko was here.
Those words were too late.
And then I came to the roof again.
Sempai was working.

[Misato]
"There...there we go."

She was working hard with gloves on.
Sorry for coming during the war.
I softly closed the door.
Around here somewhere?
I sat in a chair and stood by.
I read a manga magazine to kill time.
But my awareness was on my surroundings.
It's coming closer.
Softly, softly.
The killing intent.
She's scattering the very malice she hates into her surroundings.
A thread of tension had been tightened.
Don't come.
The door silently opened five centimeters.
But I knew.
With this much murderous intent, even a normal person would feel it coming.
The shining black arrowhead pointed toward me.
The murderous intent hitting me.
I made an intentional and well-timed roll to one side.

[Kiri]
"......ah!"

The arrow passed through where I'd been sitting a moment ago.
I jumped up and flew out into the hallway.
Kiri's back was running away.

[Taichi]
"Haha......"

I gave chase.
This game of tag is different from Monday's, Kiri.
I was writhing in joy.
I gave chase.
Kiri ran. Sometimes she turned to look behind her.
She saw me, and increased her speed further.
......you're just going to wear yourself out, Kiri.
We passed through the front gate.
She wants to go into town?
Kiri's speed while holding the weapon definitely wasn't fast.
I thought about my pace as I chased.
Just right to deny her rest, so as not to give her a chance to ready another arrow.
At long last Kiri reached the mountain trail.
Don't perish, I thought.
And then,
Kiri ran out of strength at the hokora.
She was hiding in the grass.

[Taichi]
"......finally......Kiri, you really did it."

A declaration of war,
A fight,
With me.

[Taichi]
"You became my enemy."

[Kiri]
"Ha, ha! Ha......"

She desperately tried to control her rough breathing.
And hurried to load another arrow.
On the other side of the grass.
I can imagine Kiri as her time is being taken up by that.
If you're not very proficient, it's not something that will go smoothly when you need it to.
It's game over for Kiri now.
I took out my knife.
I don't think there's a need to kill her.
But I took it out.
For some reason.
Rather strong instincts had moved me to do so.
The remnants of rationality.
If you become a little uneasy, it ceases to be of use.
Now, in order to scare her further, I cut my way through the grass fence with my blade.

[Kiri]
"......kya......ha, haaa."

With just that, she turned the color of terror.
And then, I...

[Taichi]
"--!!"

Bent back my upper body using all my joints.
A second shot. The jet black arrow shot through the space where my forehead had been 0.1 seconds ago.
What timing!
I was amazed for a while.
For five seconds.
Admiration and shock.
Kiri had deceived me perfectly.
I cut my way through the grass.
On the other side......she was no longer there.
I only heard the sound of tall grass being parted as she returned to the mountain path.
I no longer felt like giving chase.

[Taichi]
"......haha, amazing..."

I'd nearly died.
Death.

[Taichi]
"This is exciting."

I put my hand on my chest to confirm it.
This stimulation.
I'd tasted the joy of living by dark means.
I wrote in my diary and went to bed.
Will Kiri come and attack me tonight?
Will I be able to sense her?
It feels like I'll have good dreams.
