[Taichi]
"......now then,"

Since it's before noon, the air temperature isn't that high yet.
I went to the roof alone.
I looked up at the steel tower, the base and the antenna.
This certainly isn't......a job for only one person.
Since we're amateurs, the antenna looked rather distorted.
Its form was like a monster of wavelength and directionality.

[Taichi]
"Now,"

I got to work.
......
............
..................

[Taichi]
"Damn, I don't get this."

Kurosu Taichi is slightly unfamiliar with the conveniences of modern life.

[Tomoki]
"......what are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, I figured if I did this then she'd say 'Peke-kun, you're amazing!' or 'I'm so moved!' or 'I'm getting wet' and kiss me......or something. Yo, Tomoki-sensei."

[Tomoki]
"She's not going to kiss you."
[Tomoki]
"This for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, yep."

Tomoki lazily sat down on the ground.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, thanks."

Canned juice.
Though it wasn't all that cold.

[Tomoki]
"......Taichi...why are you so eager to do this?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, a serious youth-flavored question."

[Tomoki]
"You're making no sense or seaweed."

[Taichi]
"That joke was hilarious."

[Tomoki]
"Hey, hey, don't evade a question you brought upon yourself."

Tomoki pulled out a postcard.
//It was "letter" before, but for obvious reasons I went back and changed the previous instances of this line to "postcard." 〜IX

[Taichi]
"You say I brought it on myself, but it was someone else's hands that mailed that."

[Tomoki]
"......why are you working for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Can I ask something too?"

With a serious face.

[Tomoki]
"Mm?"

[Taichi]
"It has to do with......you and your nee-san. Are you okay with that?"

[Tomoki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"It's a serious question."

[Tomoki]
"......okay. What?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

I pushed out my question a little stiffly.

[Taichi]
"Why do you, a person from Kantou, sometimes use 『nan?』 for 『what?』 and 『sou yan』 for 『that's true』 like part of some pseudo-Kansai dialect?"

[Tomoki]
"That question has absolutely nothing to do with Aneki!!"
[Tomoki]
"I'm going home......"

[Taichi]
"Woah, woah, hold up a minute. Rome wasn't built in a day."

[Tomoki]
"Thank you for depressing me, Taichi-kun."

[Taichi]
"Yep. My conversations always take the scenic route."
[Taichi]
"In other words...think about it, doesn't having an objective give a person something to live for?"

[Tomoki]
"......something to live for."
[Tomoki]
"Once basic needs are met, that sort of thing might be nice."

[Taichi]
"That's why I was enamored with this."

[Tomoki]
"'This'?"

[Taichi]
"Youth Group Grafitea."
[Taichi]
"What flavor do you think this has?"

[Tomoki]
"No, that's not tea."

Tomoki stood up and circled the antenna.

[Tomoki]
"So......that's it?"

[Taichi]
"It's nice to have something to do."

[Tomoki]
"......we do have something. Like looking for materials."

[Taichi]
"At the very least, this club has hope."

[Tomoki]
"You might only be able to confirm your despair, you know?"

[Taichi]
"There's the hope that we can confirm despair."

[Tomoki]
"......I can't understand how you think, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"

[Tomoki]
"Why do you seem to be enjoying this so much?"

[Taichi]
"He-he."

[Tomoki]
"Truly, unbelievable."

Tomoki wiped his eyes with his arms.

[Tomoki]
"All I know......are the materials used in wiring mobiles and antennas."

[Taichi]
"Then help out."

[Tomoki]
"What the? At least pretend to feel a little more gratitude than that."

[Taichi]
"Idiot, I'm crying on the inside. My tears are even bitter."

[Tomoki]
"It doesn't look that way."

[Taichi]
"It's lame for two guys to get damp with each other's tears, so go do that with your nee-chan."

[Tomoki]
"You're horrible!"

[Taichi]
"Now, if you've made that decision then hurry up and work! The planned broadcast day is tomorrow."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, yeah."
[Tomoki]
"Then I'll go procure some materials."
[Tomoki]
"......Taichi?"

Tomoki's feet stopped in front of the door.

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Tomoki]
"I thought you'd tell me to make up with Aneki no matter what, but instead you tell me to help her out as a brother."

[Taichi]
"Oh no, sibling rivalry is part of a healthy life. I wouldn't stop it."

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"The point being, I was telling you to help me out."

I stuck out my chest.

[Tomoki]
"......aren't you a bigshot."

[Taichi]
"I'm the overlord of all adaptation coefficients over eighty."

[Tomoki]
"......even if you're an overlord, I'll still be your friend."
[Tomoki]
"Because I don't dislike that."

He disappeared inside the school building. As if running away.

[Taichi]
"'Because I don't dislike'......huhu!"

When Tomoki said that, for a moment his face was as red as the limits of humanity would allow.

[Taichi]
"Don't say it if you're going to get embarrassed. Seriously."

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"But, this should get it progressing a bit."

An enjoyable farce of a club.
This could become a precious memory.
Though it won't be a memory that remains.
I thought of leaving behind in the diaries that that possibility existed.

[Miki]
"Goood mooorniiing."

[Taichi]
"Could you go to the club room and bring me a new pair of gloves?"

[Miki]
"I'm being used already......"

She disappeared into the building.

[Misato]
"Good morning."

[Taichi]
"Please massage my shoulders."

[Misato]
"Ah, okay."
[Misato]
"Squeeze, squeeze."

Work while having one's shoulders massaged.

[Misato]
"They're not that stiff."

[Taichi]
"It's a mental thing."

[Misato]
"Squeeze, squeeze."
[Misato]
"Wait, why am I massaging your-!?"

She noticed.

[Taichi]
"It just happened."

[Kiri]
"......I'm here."

[Taichi]
"Give me a morning kiss."

[Kiri]
"Eh........................?"

[Misato]
"You can't forcibly demand such a thing..."

[Taichi]
"Hagyaaa!"

A heavy attack that looked light.

[Miki]
"I've got the gloves."
[Miki]
"Ha!? He's sleeping!?"
[Miki]
"Using people while you're off taking a nap!!!"
[Miki]
"......I sentence you to pants-lowering."
[Miki]
"Slide, slide."

[Misato]
"Wait, Yamanobe-san, you're lowering his underwear too!"

[Miki]
"Slide, slide, slide."

[Misato]
"Wait, wait!!"

[Miki]
"But...no girl can hold back after coming this far."
[Miki]
"I have to keep going and penetrate."

[Misato]
"What you're saying sounds like Peke-kun......"

[Miki]
"We're master and pupil after all."
[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, Kiri-chin, hey, hey, can you see something?"

[Kiri]
"I told you I don't want to see it!"
//"didn't" makes it sound like she wants to look now but just not before even though that's clearly not the case. Also, "see it" makes it sound more natural.-Spin

[Miki]
"Theeere, theeere......"
[Miki]
"Uwaaa, it's ouuuut! Something bouncy came ouuut!!!"
[Miki]
"It's come out!"

[Misato]
"That's why I said-!"

[Kiri]
"Cover it with something! That bothers me!"

Was that a 'kyaaa?' Was that a 'kyaaa?'

[Taichi]
"......uu, uuun......"

The commotion woke me up.

[Miki]
"Nyagooo, don't get near him!"

[Misato]
"Y-you've done something that can't be taken back!"

[Kiri]
"Miki, you did this, take responsibility for it!"

[Miki]
"Impossible, impossible, physically impossible! I'm a virgin! This is something for President-sempai, as our elder-"

[Misato]
"I-I'm a virgin too! Being older has nothing to do with it!"

[Miki]
"......Sempai hasn't experienced it either?"

[Kiri]
"N-neither have I......it's absolutely impossible......"

[Miki]
"That object is more than a mere maiden can handle!"
//I don't know if it was just me but it just felt like it was missing something.-Spin

It's quite noisy.
I stood up.
Strangely refreshing.
It felt as if the wind was piercing through my skin. Did I catch a cold?

[Taichi]
"Ummmmm?"

Their three pairs of eyes turned to me all at once.
And then were surprised all at once.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong, Ojou-sans? Hu!"

I asked them with a gentlemanly tone.

[All Three]
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!?"

A scream that rent my ear. X 3
They ran off like rabbits.
So I chased after them like a rabbit.
//"And" sounded a little out of place in that context. Not 100% on "so" but it's the only thing I could think of.-Spin

[Taichi]
"What's wrong, young girl-san?"

[Misato]
"P-please don't come any closer! Stay away, nooo, disgustiiiing!!!"

[Taichi]
"Eeeeeeeeeeee!!!"

Rejection.
I was being rejected.
Again and again I am rejected.
I'm destined to be thought of as disgusting.

[Taichi]
"Damn iiiiiiiiiiiit!!"

I chased after them like crazy.
I felt like crying.

[Taichi]
"Is it that strange to have white hair!?"

[Miki]
"I'm not criticizing that at all! Aaah, don't come here! Kiaaaa!!"

[Taichi]
"Am I that unsettling!!?"

[Miki]
"Ah! Hahahahahahahahaha!!! Kyaaa-kyaaa-kyaaa!! It's shakiiing!! It's shakiiing!!!"

At least this one seems to be having fun.

[Taichi]
"My heart is shaking in pain!!"

[Kiri]
"Wait, no, nononono! Nooooooooooo!!"

[Taichi]
"Am I that unpleasant!?"
[Taichi]
"I can't help being hated because of my personality, but you people are the worst for showing me abhorrence based on my outward appearance!!"

I changed my target.

[Taichi]
"Dossharaaaaaaaa!!!"

[Kiri]
"Noooooooooooooo!!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey, I think I can reach you, Kiri-saaaan!"

[Miki]
"Aaah, Kiri-chin's going to be raped!"

[Misato]
"You can't go out there!"

[Miki]
"But Kiri-chin......Kiri-chin's going to-!"

[Misato]
"We can't save her anymore......"

[Miki]
"That's-! At this rate Kiri-chin's chastity......"

[Misato]
"To prevent Sakura-san's sacrifice from being in vain, let's run!"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin......I'm sorry......I won't forget about you!"

[Kiri]
"Are you kidding!? Sempai! Mikiiii! You're inhuman!!"

[Taichi]
"I see you're resigned to your fate Sakura Kiri......no......Love Slave Sakura Kiri!"

I chased her to the fence.

[Kiri]
"Gu, gu, guuu."

She's half crying.
That arouses me.

[Kiri]
"Gu, gu, gu......do-don't touch me you molesteeeeeeeeer!!!"

[Taichi]
"Guaaaa!!"

Kiri snapped, and kicked me down.

[Taichi]
"Gunuu."

I got up right when the three of them were hurriedly disappearing into the building.

[Taichi]
"......uuu......uuuuu."

I cried.
Tears of humiliation.
Is there anything as sad as this?
Is a human's value confined to their outward appearance?
Even though they all normally said I was cute......was it all a lie?
White hair. Eyes with peculiar irises. And my nose might be a bit crooked.
I couldn't help appearing odd.
But, how am I supposed to change that!?
Am I supposed to get plastic surgery like Michael?
You can't perform plastic surgery on eyes and hair to begin with.
Besides......I don't like that idea because it's like admitting defeat.
Aaaaaah...
It really is harsh to be rejected by people......
At times, I'm not sure why I keep pretending to be a clown.
All I'm aiming to become is an existence loved by everyone, like the main character of some story...
There are sides of me I exaggerate and caricature, but...
There are......but......you know......

[Taichi]
"Ooouuu."

Sobbing.
The world is endlessly cruel.
I hung my head.
My penis appeared.

[Taichi]
"What the hell is that!!?"

Moreover, isn't it pulsing from my mental persecution? Because I'm a masochist?
My pants and underwear are...

[Taichi]
"Uuoh!? All the way over there?"

The place where I'd collapsed.
I put them on.

[Taichi]
"I see......that was all because this thing was out......"

I was saved...a little.
//Better effect.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Even so, why did I strip the bottom half of my clothes......?"

This incident had many mysteries.
But that aside,

[Taichi]
"......all three......saw it..."

I wanted to die.
This is a perfect time for positive thinking!

[Taichi]
"Didn't the fact that I'm a Martian get discovered precisely because I was on full throttle!?"

[Sakuraba]
"A pseudo-Martian?"

[Taichi]
"Since I'm still growing."

[Tomoki]
"Hmmm. I didn't know that. Must be rough."

[Taichi]
"When did you get here!?"

I broke down crying.
......I was overheard right after being seen......
My relations with the masses are all in tatters.

[Tomoki]
"Just now. Hey, you wanted these here, right?"

The two of them were carrying equipment.

[Sakuraba]
"Worry not, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"What about......?"

[Sakuraba]
"Regarding the size and expansion rate, I'm sure there is absolutely too much skin."
//I don't really get the second part. Is he hinting about being uncircumsized? I'll just assume that's another of Sakuraba's weird lines for now.-Spin

[Taichi]
"That comforting doesn't make me happy at all!"

[Tomoki]
"Anyway, what should we do for now?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, thanks. Just leave them somewhere. Then, please fulfill your responsibility by connecting them."

[Tomoki]
"I'm being used......I'm being used really well......"
[Tomoki]
"What else will you need?"

[Taichi]
"I guess we'll need batteries. Were there any in the school?"

[Tomoki]
"Do we still have the ones from the campout?"

[Taichi]
"And we'll need a tent. Since the equipment could get hot, or get rained on."

[Sakuraba]
"But we have three tents right here."

[Taichi]
"What say you John? Where be they?"

I intentionally asked him.

[Tomoki]
"Sorry, but I can see how this ends."

So can I.

[Sakuraba]
"They are......within our pants."
//lol, I was not expecting that.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Wahahahaha!"

[Tomoki]
"Ahahaha!"

[Sakuraba]
"Huhuhu."

But we laughed anyway.
The three idiots loooove crude humor.

[Tomoki]
"So it's that."

[Taichi]
"Eh? What? What?"

[Tomoki]
"Huhu!......hu, normally it's folded up."

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahaha!"

[Sakuraba]
"Hahaha!"

We laughed at the inside joke.

[Sakuraba]
"And, there are individual differences in the height."
//Oh man, I would totally fit in with these guys.-Spin

[Tomoki]
"Huhu!!"

[Taichi]
"Also, there's a one-touch tent. A small tent that seems to simply pop up. If you stimulate it the right way it'll momentarily erect itself---"

[Tomoki]
"......!......!!!"

[Sakuraba]
"......kukuku!"

We held our chests while beating each other's shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Get a patent for that."

[Sakuraba]
"A tent making practical applications of biotechnology."

[Tomoki]
"My...my stomach hurts..."

[Taichi]
"And, when it becomes a hit product and they interview us about where the original concept came from......we'll tell them it was a c**k!......hu!"

I took it too far.

[Sakuraba]
"......!!!"

[Tomoki]
"Please! Stop! Stop, my stomach muscles are at their limit......"

The three of us took deep breaths.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, a proper tent."

We went back to the previous topic.

[Tomoki]
"Aaah......that's right, we'd planned to get one last year with some of the club's money. Did we ever buy it?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry......that got brushed aside because of me."

[Tomoki]
"Eh?"

[Sakuraba]
"......the Shinkawa Yutaka incident."

With that phrase, the air became solemn.

[Tomoki]
"......so that's what it was."

[Taichi]
"Well, there was a lot going on with me too..."

[Sakuraba]
"Don't worry about it."
[Sakuraba]
"I trust that you are a man who can carry out a task on his own."

[Taichi]
"You plan to make me do it on my own!?"
[Taichi]
"Speaking of which, why do you think I sent out all those postcards!?"

[Sakuraba]
"Trust. It's a beautiful word."

[Tomoki]
"That's an incredibly unfair way to use it......"

[Taichi]
"Eeeei, it doesn't matter so just go get the tent and the batteries!"

[Sakuraba]
"Then I'll get the batteries."

[Tomoki]
"So I'll get the tent......can that be carried by one person?"

[Taichi]
"What if you use a car?"

[Tomoki]
"......I don't have a license......oh, right."

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu, there are no police here, my friend."

It's already a crime to make your own broadcast channel without approval.

[Tomoki]
"I'd like to try driving. Though I don't know much about cars."

[Taichi]
"The manual cars are simpler."

[Tomoki]
"Manual?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. The ones with three pedals."
[Taichi]
"I think you'll find one quickly if you look in the staff parking spaces. Don't take one with two pedals. Those are dangerous for an amateur to drive."

[Tomoki]
"Oookaaay."

[Taichi]
"So Raba's got the batteries."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, leave it to me."
[Sakuraba]
"One question though..."

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Sakuraba]
"What do they look like?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, take Sakuraba with you. Get the tent and the batteries together."

[Tomoki]
"......yeah, I'll do that."

Sakuraba was a salty guy who'd make you cry if you used him as a standalone anything.
They both left.

[Taichi]
"Now,"

It should be just about noon.
I was hungry.
I do have the bentou from Youko-chan......that usual double portion.
Shall I eat it with someone?
The second year classroom......she's not here.
Seriously, what happened to Touko?
Did she not see the postcard?
......as an ojou-sama, she might not check the mail herself.
Also, nowadays, no one would think that any mail was coming.
I'll go see how she's doing later.
So, the first year classroom.
All the rooms are arranged and decorated in the same way, but I might bump into them.
//I'm extremely unsure what this line meant, so if it sounds too out of place, feel free to just cut it. 〜IX
//I'd be reluctant to cut, since the first part seems to relate to some later lines on repetition - Sheeta
The Flowers weren't there.
I'll try looking in the other classrooms.
Not here.
Not this one either.
Even the book ends look similar.
Next one...
Even the location of the erasers was the same.
Don't call this some kind of mathematical identity.
But, it is a coincidence. That's true.
Anyway, neither Miki nor Kiri is here.
......they seriously ran away.
Where should I eat?
IF $KIRIBAD == 0 $B = 1
IF $KIRIBAD == 1 $B = 2
