[Taichi]
"Yes yes yes yes!"

I flew out of the house with great vigor.
Having been on standby behind the door, building up my power, I flew way, way up.

[Taichi]
"Yes, thank you!"

Normally, I'd do some shameful 'play' here.
Commuting salarymen.
Graceful students.
Gatherings of great-great-grandgals on their way to school.
Even though all those people would be covering me all over with their lukewarm gazes,
There's no one here.

[Taichi]
......*sigh*

So it really wasn't a dream.

[Taichi]
"Nnn."

No.
It's far too soon to decide that.
For you to decide that.

[Taichi]
"Huhu!"

I covered my mouth.
Humanity's annihilation?!

[Taichi]
"Uhuhuhu! Huhu!!"

I laughed heavily.
For humanity to be annihilated now, of all times?
This is the 21st century.
That's just too hackneyed.
Even if the unsinkable Japan goes under, the Japanese islands won't.

[Taichi]
"Now then,"

After laughing for some time, I suddenly became calm.
Getting excited without anyone around is ineffectual.

[Taichi]
"That's it. I'll go see Yuusa-chan."

The day cannot begin without seeing the face of the pretty little girl living nearby.
I went to the nearby Doujima house.

[Taichi]
"Yuusa-chaaaan, heeey!"

I knocked on the door. There was no answer.
//Better dramatic effect.-Spin
//comma doesn't stop for long enough IMO - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"Are you in there!?"

That's right, the doorbell.
Their doorbell had a security video feed on it.
I pushed it.
No sound.

[Taichi]
"......ah, that's right."

The power was out.
Televisions,
Phones,
Vacuum cleaners, refrigerators,
Nothing.
I pounded on the door.

[Taichi]
"Mother-in-law-samaaaa?"
[Taichi]
"Yusa-yusaaa!"
[Taichi]
"I'm here for your ojou-saaan!"
[Taichi]
"Mamaaa......"
[Taichi]
"Yu......sa......"

I loosened the fist I'd been pounding with and let it fall down to my side.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

I went to Yoshida-san's house.

[Taichi]
"Gau!!"

Combat, the wild dog, should be there.
However,

[Taichi]
"......"

The doghouse was empty.

[Taichi]
"Even dogs?"

Come to think of it, I haven't even seen a single cat.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, hmmm."
[Taichi]
"This might be a very consistent dream."

If it is a dream, then I don't care.

[Taichi]
"Guess I'll go to school."

It was my first walk to school in a month and a half.
I looked up. The weather was nice.
Good weather for walking to school.
Commuting pleasure.
The sunlight that reached my eyes was filtered by my white bangs.

[Taichi]
"I'd wanted to get this cut......"

Disagreeable.
Partly because of the color, I don't like my hair that much.

[Taichi]
"Haa."

While playing with my bangs, I set off on the hill-strewn path to school, commonly called the 『School Hills』.
//Lines like this are a pain to adapt because "Going to School" is one word (tsuugaku) in Japanese and "Going to School Hills" felt way to literal. Other suggestions welcome. 〜IX
Walking, walking.
//You may not have noticed, but some of these lines are identical in Japanese, but not in my tls, to lines from cca0003. I'll leave it up to you guys which version needs to be changed to improve the match, or if they're close enough already. 〜IX
At that moment.

[Nanaka]
"Kyaaaaaaaaaa!!?"

What the-!?
*impact!*

[Nanaka]
"Kyawawawawawawawawawawawawawa!!!"

[Taichi]
"Uuorururururururururururururu!!?"

I revolved in the shape of a swastika.

[Nanaka]
"Brake! Brake!"

[Taichi]
"Buuuuuuuuuun!!"

Then I changed to a propeller and slammed into the ground.

[Taichi]
"Guaaaa......"

[Nanaka]
"Aaah! I'm sorrryyy!"

[Taichi]
"Obuobuobuobu."

Comic force!?
*comic force = A suprascientific theory of Taichian science combining scalar electromagnetism, the astrophysical theory of aether, flying machines and so on. It simultaneously accelerates and mitigates various physical phenomena.
As a result, manga-like effects unthinkable in classical physics may manifest. Statistically, it occurs often in prideful and youthful personalities, and functions to maintain that characterization.
//Hopefully the resemblance to (ie, the copy pasta from) script cca0023 is obvious. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"You trying to kill me!!?"

[Nanaka]
"Sorryyyy!"

The girl put her hands together.

[Taichi]
"You virgin..."

I spat out.

[Nanaka]
"Uhi."

[Taichi]
"You think you can understand the zeal of those people who had their hopes set on the Messerschmitt defeating the Allies?"

[Nanaka]
"I don't need to understand that......"

[Taichi]
"Making people spin like propellers..."

I threw down my pride and turned toward school.

[Nanaka]
"Ah, wait up!"

She caught up to me.
Then she matched my pace and jumped onto her bicycle.

[Nanaka]
"There we go."

A wobbly formation.
But still, this virgin......

[Nanaka]
"Yep. You're calming down this time. Not bad, not bad."

[Taichi]
"......eh?"

[Nanaka]
"Taichi's great."

[Taichi]
"......ha?"

A risky person?
Is she dangerous?
......so am I.
I mean, so are all of us.
//is he referring to *everyone*, or just the two of them? If it's just the two of them, 'both of us' might be better - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."

[Nanaka]
"?"

[Taichi]
"......geez."

I can't laugh.
Still, who is this virgin?
Any way you look at her---

[Girl]
"Up we go."

She tried doing a slight wheelie.

[Taichi]
"!!!??"

Her panties-!?
My thoughts were cut off.
I'm really weak against sudden erotic events.
//Hopefully, you can also see the similarity to cca0003. Very little direct copying though. Since I'm looking at cca0003 as I do this, assume any slight differences, like "sudden" instead of "unforseen," are intentional. 〜IX
//Was "week" a play on words lol? Doubt it. - pondrthis
In the process, my short term memory of the previous moments was cleanly erased.
What a brain.
Well, whatever.

[Nanaka]
"Well, it sure is hot."

[Taichi]
"Because it's summer."

[Nanaka]
"New term, Monday, new meetings, farewells."
[Nanaka]
"And then the hokora."

[Taichi]
"What?"

Hokora?

[Nanaka]
"When this scene ends there'll be a choice leading to the hokora."
//NOT A TYPO, I SWEAR. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"No, there won't be any such choice."

[Nanaka]
"Heartlesssss."

She seemed ready to cry.

[Taichi]
"Why do I have to go all the way up to that mountain? I have school you know."

[Nanaka]
"But there aren't any people at school."

[Taichi]
"That's not true."

I said calmly.

[Taichi]
"Since this is a dream, if I go to school everyone will be right there."

[Nanaka]
"No, humanity's been annihilated."

[Taichi]
"That's a lieeeeeeeeee!!!"

[Nanaka]
"No, that's actually the case."

[Taichi]
"I can't hear you! I can't hear that sci-fi-novel-esque explanation!"
//SOS on the hyphens 〜IX
//It is sci-fi-novel-esque, not novel-esque (the proper word for which is actually "romantic"). Thus, hyphens all the way. - pondrthis

[Nanaka]
"It's not a sci-fi novel..."

[Taichi]
"Yes yes, that conversation is over!"

[Nanaka]
"......every single time, Taichi's mental faculties are different."

[Taichi]
"Every time?"

The virgin heaved a huge sigh.

[Nanaka]
"I thought you were being strangely calm about it, but here you are rejecting reality."
[Nanaka]
"But...it might be a strength that you're not adhering to a specific tendency......"

She grabbed me by the chest (while riding her bike) (skilled).

[Nanaka]
"That's why I've been laboring every time!"

*wobble* *shake* *wobble!*

[Taichi]
"Au-au-au!"

[Nanaka]
"Go to the hokora, go for me!"

[Taichi]
"No more, no more violence!"

[Nanaka]
"Will you go to the hokora?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, I'll go!"

I'm suffering......I might die.

[Nanaka]
"Is that absolute?"

I nodded twice.

[Nanaka]
"Very well."

I was released.

[Taichi]
*wheeze* *wheeze*

It seemed better not to disobey her.

[Taichi]
"But why the hokora......?"

[Nanaka]
"Oh no, it's just that, you know, there's a god in that area."
//Thus begins a mass of copy pasta. 〜IX

The two of us stared at each other for a while.
Then, at the same exact time,

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahaha."

[Nanaka]
"Ahahahahaha."

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahahahahaha."

[Nanaka]
"Ahahahahahahahahahaha."
[Nanaka]
"That place happens to be one of his favorites."

[Taichi]
"Don't continue on like nothing happened."

[Nanaka]
"Oh no, you should be laughing at this. I'd do the same if someone said that to me with a straight face."

[Taichi]
"Then you made that straight face just to make me laugh?"

[Nanaka]
"Yes, but......this is a bit of a serious topic."

[Taichi]
"A god?"

[Girl]
"Yes."
//And...here it ends.  New lines now. From now on CP_S means CopyPasta_Start, and CP_F means _Finish. 〜IX

[Nanaka]
"It's important."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Nanaka]
"Just believe me, it's important!"
//"Anyway" didn't make sense in english here.-Spin

Emphasis.
It made no sense.

[Taichi]
"What are you anyway?"

[Nanaka]
"......did you say 'what am I?'"

[Taichi]
"Did you think I wouldn't figure it out?"

I made a flourish of brushing aside my bangs.

[Taichi]
"Did you really think I would be unable to see right through you!?"

[Nanaka]
"Uu!"

[Taichi]
"I, Kurosu Taichi, am a young adult candidate who's tasted both the sweets and sours of life. It's going to take more than one young, respectable panty-flashing girl to fool these eyes!"

I informed her of that while sticking my thumb up with gusto.

[Nanaka]
"Flash."

I saw her panties for a moment.

[Taichi]
"Uoooooooooo!!!"
[Taichi]
"Uooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"
[Taichi]
"Bombole!!!"

While blowing blood out my nose, I collapsed.
(TL Note: This appears to be the Italian word for cylinders of compressed gas.)

[Nanaka]
"So weak......"

[Taichi]
"Obuobuobu."

I was struck without warning.

[Nanaka]
"But a nosebleed...are you from an 80's sitcom?"

[Taichi]
"That was a cheap hit."

[Nanaka]
"You're the one who tried to pry into my business so suddenly."

[Taichi]
"Wasn't that a normal question?"
[Taichi]
"Anyone would ask that if a virgin they'd never met suddenly started talking to them like an old friend."
//I think somewhere we should mention that if you say the word "shojo" (virgin) fast that it sounds like "shoujo" (girl) [I said this backwards]... otherwise it seems like Nanaka is acting a lot like Miki in that she lets him continually refer to her as a sexual object... - pondrthis

I stood up.

[Nanaka]
"It isn't like we haven't met before."

[Taichi]
"Double negative."

[Nanaka]
"What are you, AT*K?"
//I'm thinking IME falls under the same category as G-spot, in that if someone doesn't know it, it's so easy to look up without knowing anything about Japan that there's no real need for me to explain it. 〜IX
//Agreed - pondrthis
//probably should be AT*K following the bleep - Raide

[Taichi]
"When have we met?"
(TL Note: ATOK is an advanced Japanese IME, with numerous features including spelling and grammar checks.)

[Nanaka]
"......that's a tough question."

The virgin looked far into the distance.

[Nanaka]
"There's no right way to answer that."

[Taichi]
"......it's been bugging me for a while, but..."

[Nanaka]
"Nnyu?"

She said 'nnyu.'
I can't disregard her.

[Taichi]
"You...you aren't an Earthling, are you?"

[Nanaka]
"Haa?"

[Taichi]
"What planet are you from?"

[Nanaka]
"Earth."

[Taichi]
"Lies. There's no Earthling like you!"
[Taichi]
"Why are your movements so fluffy!? Isn't that strange!?"

[Nanaka]
"Fluffy?"

[Taichi]
"Somehow......you just seem to be floating, like I can't really grasp you, or your presence feels different...you're just different in some way I can't explain!"
[Taichi]
"Ha!!? Could you...could you be trying to pull me down to being a captive of that lewd alluring flower petal so that you can suck out my essence?!"
//lawl perverted - pondrthis
[Taichi]
"Are you a succubus? Are you!?"

I feared her like a kitten.

[Nanaka]
"Calm down."

[Taichi]
"Funa?"

She hugged me.

[Taichi]
"............"

[Nanaka]
"You've gotten a bit nervous. There, there."

Tightly.
My face sunk into pressure superior to the softness.
//I don't quite understand it with "pressure" there but "pleasure" should get the message across.-Spin
//I think he's talking about pressure as in the pressure of her boobs. I'm reverse editing yo, sue me. - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"Oooh......"
[Taichi]
"These very hills are those of a mother. These two hills shall become the cornerstone upon which I can found the Eroman Empire, and their names shall garner fame in all the countries of the world!"
//LOL nicely done. I wouldn't suggest a TL note but you might like to know this is a reference to the founding of the Roman Empire, with the wolfmother and the hills and the twin bros Romulus and Remus - pondrthis

[Nanaka]
"Don't touch my chest."

[Taichi]
"My first breasts in so long......"
//Boobs sound a little too immature, even for Taichi.-Spin

[Nanaka]
"I told you not to touch them."

Her knee entered the pit of my stomach.
My body floated into the air.

[Taichi]
"Oguo......!"

I crawled along the ground.
With the highest clumsiness.

[Taichi]
"......nnn?"

[Nanaka]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Something..."

These hands of mine which had just performed sexual harassment, I now tried to open and close them in front of my eyes.

[Taichi]
"Something feels wrong. No, not like that. How should I put it......hmmm."

I no longer understood.
The emotions which had boiled up at the time I touched that girl withered all at once.
As if I'd been castrated.

[Nanaka]
"......did that hurt?"

[Taichi]
"No."

You don't have to seriously worry about me.
I stood up.

[Taichi]
"No, I got to feel something good."

I moved back to my usual fickle and frivolous attitude for now.

[Nanaka]
"Oh, what's this now? It's only natural for ladies to have them."

[Taichi]
"A certain kind of kindness and elegance...and it makes one feel the fragrant scent floating out from within...one could say they're a product rarely seen in recent years."

I spoke like some kind of professional critic.

[Nanaka]
"Undeserved words."

[Taichi]
"And now that I've calmed down,"
[Taichi]
"Tell me your name."

[Nanaka]
"......I didn't tell you?"

[Taichi]
"All I've heard is that you're a virgin passerby."

[Nanaka]
"Not that I ever said I was a virgin passerby......"
[Nanaka]
"I am Nanaka."

[Taichi]
"I am Taichi."

[Nanaka]
"I know."

[Taichi]
"Why do you know my name?"

[Nanaka]
"See-ker-et♪"

Full of mysteries.

[Nanaka]
"Why don't we leave it at that?"

[Taichi]
"Now, back to the main topic......what exactly are you?"

[Nanaka]
"Bye-byeee."

[Taichi]
"Hold it!"

I ran to her departing back.

[Nanaka]
"Whatsit?"

Uu! That's a moe word I've never heard before.
There's no doubt its worldwide usage totals just as small a number as that of the phrase 『Irkutsk Mania』.

[Taichi]
"I would love to make an exception for that pity word and let you get away, but at least come clean about which planet you're from!"
(TL Note: Irkutsk is a city in Russia. The phrase "Irkutsk Mania" is utterly meaningless.)

[Nanaka]
"I'm telling you, it's Earth."

[Taichi]
"Lies! Your presence is not that of an Earthling!"

I took one of my best karade stances.
Karade is the ultimate martial art.

[Nanaka]
"Hu hu hu."

She pointed to me with a white fingertip.

[Taichi]
"?"

No, to something behind me.
I turned around, and for several seconds the school was in my field of vision.
No response.
I returned my gaze to Nanaka.
She'd disappeared.
Along with her bike.
Not a phenomenon which could be explained just by the speed of her bike.

[Taichi]
"............huh?"

The cicadas weren't chirping. A quiet new term.
