My house.
Today, in this consistently lonely space, there is a flower.

[Taichi]
"Now, come in."

[Kiri]
"O-okay then......"
[Kiri]
"Uwaa."

My room was in love with chaos.
Most visitors were surprised by it.

[Taichi]
"Be seated."

[Kiri]
"......sit where?"

[Taichi]
"Okay."

I somersaulted.

[Kiri]
"......okay...?"

[Taichi]
"Make some space wherever you want to sit."

[Kiri]
"........................"

Self-responsibility.
In the space I'd made by somersaulting, Kiri sat down in an awkward seiza.

[Kiri]
"......boys..."

[Taichi]
"Wait here a minute."

I went downstairs and brought up a tomato.

[Taichi]
"Here, vitamins."

[Kiri]
"......thank you."

She took a bite from the tomato.

[Taichi]
"You can relax. We'll be living here forever."

[Kiri]
"......nn."

Her movements stopped.

[Kiri]
"For......ever?"

[Taichi]
"You don't want to?"

[Kiri]
"......I don't know."
[Kiri]
"Sempai is already my first, so......"

Uwaa.

[Kiri]
"Besides, I feel this is atonement."
[Kiri]
"For both Yutaka and I."

Yutaka, huh?
Kiri will probably always continue to be that person.
Yutaka. Yutaka. Yutaka.
Yutaka.

[Taichi]
"......shall I make you eat that tomato?"

[Kiri]
"Eh?"

I took Kiri's tomato and bit into it.
I chewed it several times, then kissed her.

[Kiri]
"Nn!!?"

I flowed it in along with saliva.
//lol, I've never seen "flowed" in that context before. I don't know if I want to change it or not though since it adds a little bit of humor.-Spin

[Kiri]
"......nn, fua......nnku! Nn, nnnnnnn."

She resisted only at first.

[Taichi]
"Delicious?"

[Kiri]
"......yes."

[Taichi]
"Then eat more."

I repeated this several times.
When I finished, Kiri's cheeks were flushed.

[Taichi]
"Kiri is only my Kiri."

[Kiri]
"......that's true."

[Taichi]
"But, you seem sad."

When I said that, Kiri ignored it and smiled.
......I could only see that as being forced.
I embraced her, and softly pushed her down.

[Kiri]
"Ah......"

The fruit we'd started eating fell to the floor.
The hokora is unsettling late at night.
I put my diary in it.
The sixth notebook.

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"

I suddenly thought.
The notebooks used as diaries were kept safe here.
After tomorrow, the world will be rolled back again.
That's why notebooks will disappear.
It's reasonable to think that I tried to write a diary entry on Monday and just never found it again.
It seems the contents of the hokora really are divided up by rules different from those of the rollback.

[Taichi]
"I get it......"

I left the diary here.
I saved its data.
From the moment I wrote the last diary entry, my......the life for only this me had begun.
//naturally, alternate adaptations welcome. 〜IX
//Tried to make it easier to understand - Sheeta
//apparently I'm the only one who can read it. 〜IX
There's no doing over.
For just one day, a life that may or may not be.
I felt like living and disappearing however I wanted.
