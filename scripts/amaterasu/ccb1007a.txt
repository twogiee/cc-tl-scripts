[Misato]
"Ah......"

When I brought Sempai's legs into the light (this time without ulterior motives)...
On the hemorrhaging part of her body......there were......bite marks.
In the vicinity of the wound, a small quantity of red heat faintly radiated under her bandages.
It looked like someone or something had tried to tear it off with their teeth.
No.
It didn't just look like that; there wasn't anything else it could've been.

[Taichi]
"......Sempai?"

[Misato]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"......have you scorned me?"

[Misato]
"Scorned?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

I can't put it into words.
How should I take account of feelings and actions that even I can't translate well.

[Taichi]
"I mean..."

Sempai softly smiled.

[Misato]
"You've done nothing to deserve my scorn."

[Taichi]
"......are you...sure?"

But...
I looked at her wound.
Sempai quietly covered it with her skirt.

[Misato]
"You fulfilled your promise, so I'll let it slide."
[Misato]
"Since you came to help with the club."

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"Please let me dress your wounds."

[Misato]
"......okay."

After that, I dressed her wounds.
This time, I didn't have a fit.
Because I was happy.
Because I had a nobler emotion within me.

[Misato]
"That tickles."

[Taichi]
"I'm, I'm sorry......I'm just tense."

[Misato]
"You really suck at wrapping bandages."

[Taichi]
"I haven't got any experience......"

[Misato]
"Th-that tickles!"

[Taichi]
"Uuuuu......"

Such a happy time.
There it was---

[Misato]
"Ah!"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Where's my cell phone?"

[Taichi]
"Your cell phone?"

Sudden, everyday words.
My thoughts were paralyzed.

[Misato]
"I must have dropped it."

Her face looked horribly troubled.

[Taichi]
"I'll go look for it. It's gotta be on the roof."

[Misato]
"Please do."

I left the health room, heading for the roof.
I found the cell phone right away.
It had fallen into the litter of building materials.

[Taichi]
"Why does she want her cell phone?"

A trivial question.

[Taichi]
"Never mind."

I quickly ignored it.
Everyone needs something to rely on.
Sempai might be entrusting great value to something as tiny as a cell phone, the same way I do with some of my things.

[Taichi]
"Is this it?"

[Misato]
"Aah, there it is."

Sempai took it, smiling cheek-to-cheek.

[Misato]
"Good work. Now it's all over."

[Taichi]
"Eh......?"

My face distorted, not quite into a smile.
Like I'd just heard a bad joke.

[Taichi]
"You're really letting me off easy."

[Misato]
"I'm Gunjou too, you know."
[Misato]
"So, are you going to do that again?"

[Taichi]
"......I don't know. There is a possibility."
[Taichi]
"Since it's something like a fit."

[Misato]
"Then this falls under extenuating circumstances."

[Taichi]
"......naive."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi-sempai, you're naive."
[Taichi]
"I'm not a safe underage man."

[Misato]
"But when I said 'stop,' you did stop."

I did?
I wasn't in the position to understand words at the time.
A coincidence?
It had to be.
But, I wonder...

[Taichi]
"It might be wrong for me to get any closer to Sempai......since that would mean..."

I cut off my words.
A silent summer.
So quiet, the presence of clubs and classes was growing imperceptible.
The white health room controlling tranquility.
Because the world is filled with twilight, a room with white tones will not resist, but become subordinate, and likely hand over for sacrifice the two foreign bodies it holds in its womb.
The evening color has a stronger impression than any other time of day.
It'd be truly frightening if everything changed into another world.
The time of destruction.
The time when I could see multiple worlds.
Who could guarantee that the sun, now sinking until the next morning, where it'll rise up with an unsatisfied look, is truly the same as yesterday's?
If the world met with destruction every day,
And was resurrected along with the next day, but it was only humans who didn't know about it,
There'd be no means to confirm it.
Nowhere is there proof that the actual world and the world humans recognize are one and the same.
And yet, now, I felt that only the small space of the health room was avoiding the crimson infiltration.
Because at some point, I became able to see the world clearly.

[Misato]
"......there's no such thing as a perfect person, is there?"
[Misato]
"Isn't everyone weird in some way?"
[Misato]
"If you attack each and every failure and deficiency, you can't go on living."
[Misato]
"Hey, isn't that true?"

[Taichi]
"......"

If even a single tear came out, she'd look very awkward.
But mysteriously, the intense emotions concealed their forms.

[Taichi]
"......I really admire Sempai, for inviting me to her club, when I was all alone."

I spoke falteringly.
Sempai watched over me.
Time quietly moved on.

[Taichi]
"I don't want to be hated, nor do I want to hurt anyone."
[Taichi]
"......I feel that what I've just done is inexcusable."
[Taichi]
"But I'm not confident I can control myself."

[Misato]
"What should we do?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Misato]
"First, what do we need to be careful of? Especially me."

[Taichi]
"......that's..."

If I think calmly,

[Taichi]
"If we make sure I don't see Sempai's blood..."

[Misato]
"So be careful not to get hurt?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"But I'm constructing the antenna, and using tools, so I am facing the danger of injury."

[Taichi]
"Yes, that's why it's best I don't-"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun will-"

She spoke in my place.

[Misato]
"-help me with the tasks which require brute strength, right?"

[Taichi]
"........................"

That hit home.
Deep within the ribs enclosing my heart, something quivered.

[Misato]
『You're always alone, aren't you?』
[Misato]
『Why don't we start a club together?』

One of the sayings I added to the analects within my heart.
Overwhelmingly warm, soft and powerful.
Worries I couldn't resolve on my own had dissolved with only a few words from a stranger.
I think that's why people want to make plans together, with each other.
By words, by bodies, by phones.
......by correspondence.
By any number of means.
They can make an effort to touch one another.
That's what people are.

[Misato]
"I'll have you help me with the assembly after all."

[Taichi]
"......okay."

I felt embarrassed.
Sempai was smiling like she was having fun.
Youko-san once said I'm a powerful human.
I don't like that kind of valuation.
It's wrong.
Humans other than me are simply amazing.
Mimi-sempai was always putting me in a good mood by charming and making sport of me.
That's not......something I can do by myself.
I want to be beside her.
As many days that time will allow.
Until the day it all ends.
And even then, there's still time.

[Taichi]
"Please let me."

[Misato]
"Mmm."

She lowered her head,
She slapped down her hands,
Shyly,
Finally smiling.
Now, she's back to normal.
I was so happy, tears came out.
Sempai's hands opened the curtain.
In an instant, the health room was devoured by orange.
