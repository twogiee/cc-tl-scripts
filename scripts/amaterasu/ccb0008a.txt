"May I help you with your cleaning?"

Miki smiled brightly.

[Miki]
"I refuse."

[Taichi]
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaan!"

I was refused!
Cruelly, without hesitation, not even sympathy.

[Miki]
"Sempai, isn't blood a weakness of yours?"

[Taichi]
"Eh, well that's definitely true."

Why do you know that?
A black doubt presented itself.
//"black" doubt?-Spin
I beat it back down into the abyss in 0.5 seconds.
It's Miki.
My precious, precious......flower-chan.

[Miki]
"Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"That's true. I am weak against blood."

[Miki]
"It's not actually blood, but painting supplies that got scattered around."
[Miki]
"That's why this cleaning is so hard."
[Miki]
"Plus, with this short skirt you can see my panties whenever I bend over, and it's hard to get cleaning done while dealing with a stimulated Sempai."

[Taichi]
"That is undeniable."

She said it all perfectly straight.
I liked that.

[Taichi]
"That's definitely laborious."

[Miki]
"I'll get infected."

[Taichi]
"That's definitely laborious, *cough*"

[Miki]
"Dunno."

She saluted.

[Taichi]
"Are you munching your meals?"

[Miki]
"Yes! I am munching!"

[Taichi]
"Then, as I am an adult, why don't I pull back to watch over my pupil's growth from the shadows and indirectly support her?"

[Miki]
"Dunno, but thanks."
