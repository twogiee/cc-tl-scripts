There was no night attack?
......I did have home field advantage.
There might have been traps here, so she didn't do anything reckless.
I headed to school.
Then,
Tomoki had died.
//WHAT - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"............"

The suspects decreased.
And the victims increased.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki......"

A tragic way to die.
He'd been run through the chest with long, thick wiring material.
A coincidence?......This is too rare a case to say that.
This was definitely something artificial.
That's why the culprit is---

[Taichi]
"......it's already......finished."

The world is finished.
That was the feeling I had.
Kiri's already broken, and Sakuraba probably won't return.
There's no need for me to remain a person.
......in the end, it was all just useless struggling.
A lunatic can't become a normal person.
If I can't understand others,
I thought it was okay not to understand.
Now---
Before the silent form of Tomoki, I exposed my body to the lonesome air.
//I don't like having 'body' twice in a sentence like that. It looks weird - Sheeta
No monologue was needed.
I was rapidly losing sight of the words I'd say.
Where's Kiri?
Is she not in the building?
She's probably not in her house.
Prowling. That's all.
Kiri......
No, anyone's okay......
That's right. Sempai.
That's always been on the roof.
//Usage of "that" here is intentional. 〜IX
Not here.
The fence had been broken.
Sempai had died.
When people fall, they make a pink flower.

[Taichi]
"............"

Aaah.
Fragrant blood.
I couldn't understand things anymore.
Aaah, not at all anymore.
Until now......why have I been toiling?
To hold myself back.
And then,
Evasion.
An arrow passed.
Kiri.
Was there.
Was there♪

[Kiri]
"......murderer!"

Kiri inverted a red cylinder.
Were those intestines?
White smoke.
//I have no idea what happened in these three lines. 〜IX
//His eyes or some kind of adrenaline rush perhaps - Raide

[Taichi]
"......gu!"

My vision grew dim.
......I'd gotten used to it.
To Kiri's presence.
I leaped toward her.
I grabbed her wrist.
It was holding a blade.
I gripped hard.

[Kiri]
"Uuu!"

Kiri won't let go.
She's exposing her anger like a beast.
Even harder.

[Kiri]
"Uu, uuuuuuu!"

It should hurt.
Such a slender wrist.
I could break it easily.
But she won't let go.
Aaah.
Did she see Tomoki's body?
Even though I didn't do it.
While we were quarreling, I started wanting.
//quarrelling (double l) is British - Raide
Kiri.
She's an idiot, but she's cute.
I sucked her lips.

[Kiri]
"Nn, nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!?"

[Taichi]
"......!"

I chewed her tongue.
I didn't cut it off.
My thoughts were cleared.

[Taichi]
"......Kiri......I'm the culprit."

[Kiri]
"Uuu! Why now!!?"

The hand holding the knife stood firm.

[Taichi]
"No, I'm not."

[Kiri]
"......what are you...ahaha."

Ridicule.
 + Tears.
Kiri's emotions were already starting to break.

[Kiri]
"Don't take Miki."

[Taichi]
"It's Miki."
[Taichi]
"The culprit is Miki."
//Oho, I was right~ - Sheeta
//No, you weren't. Even though she'll never read this, I'll still trolling her.-Spin

Kiri stopped.
Was that not the one and only key to making this girl stop right now?
The wind cut off.

[Kiri]
"Uuaaa......?"

A strange noise spilled out of her lungs.
Just from that, I knew it was a mortal wound.
At the same time, I felt sharp pain in my thighbone.
An arrow.
It had been shot through Kiri's thin chest and into my thighbone.
I brought my face up.

[Taichi]
"......it was you."
//No way she could have a scope on there like that. It's blocking the locking mechanism for the string.-Spin

[Miki]
"Ahaha, this is the first time I've been able to bring down Sempai."

She was innocent.
//Damn English double meaning. Ideas? 〜IX

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"......uu......huh......? Miki?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri......"

Her knife fell.
She tried to pick herself up......but failed.

[Taichi]
"Ow!"

[Kiri]
"......was I......shot?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Kiri]
"By who?"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"No......*cough!*"

Blood fell out of her mouth.

[Kiri]
"Ha, it hurts......Miki......Mi......"

Miki gazed intently at Kiri's final moments.
I couldn't read her emotions at all.

[Taichi]
"Impossible......weren't you...my friend?"

[Miki]
"............"

Kiri coughed. A huge amount of blood.

[Taichi]
"Who are you?"

[Miki]
"I am Miki."

[Taichi]
"No. Miki isn't that tenacious."

[Miki]
"......I was able to endure...Sempai and the others."

This girl......

[Taichi]
"Kiri......"

[Kiri]
"Miki......where are you? Are you behind me? I can't turn around......"

As Kiri tried to move, pain ran through my leg.
With that,
I was able to regain rationality.

[Kiri]
"It wasn't Miki, right? You weren't......the one who shot me, right?"

[Miki]
"It was me. I shot you."

[Kiri]
"Eh......?"
[Kiri]
"......it can't be..."

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

She looked up at me.
With her chest shot through, she could do nothing else.

[Kiri]
"......you're...innocent?"

[Taichi]
"Not really, but I didn't kill anyone. I don't want to kill."

[Kiri]
"............"
[Kiri]
"......I'm......sor......"

She couldn't complete her words of apology.
I softly placed my fingers on her carotid artery.

[Taichi]
"Sleep. It's a dream. When you wake up, you'll be back to your normal everyday life."

Kiri smiled, despite the contradictions in those words.

[Kiri]
"Aha."

I tightened slightly. That was enough.

[Kiri]
"......ah.................."

I killed her gently.

[Miki]
"......!"

[Taichi]
"Ow!......"

I pulled the arrow out of our bodies.
The wound to my femur was shallow.
But, it's practically unable to move now.

[Taichi]
"......are you going to kill me too?"

[Miki]
"Did you finish her off?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Miki]
"You're kind, Sempai."

[Taichi]
"Will you kill me too?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"For what reason?"

[Miki]
"......do you want to know?"
[Miki]
"I'd been thinking that Sempai had gone berserk and lost his rationality, but..."

[Taichi]
"Wow, you know about me."

[Miki]
"And about Hasekura-sempai."

[Taichi]
"......why did you kill everyone?"

[Miki]
"I'm not killing them."

[Taichi]
"Then who killed them?"

[Miki]
"Coincidences."

[Taichi]
"......Miki, please don't toy with me. I'm talking seriously."

[Miki]
"It's true. They were coincidences. I call it the invisible hand."

[Taichi]
"Invisible hand?"

[Miki]
"This sort of thing happens once in a long while."
[Miki]
"At first......Hasekura-sempai? This is the first time she's died..."
[Miki]
"I am the one who prepared the traps, but this is the first time she's died."

[Taichi]
"......so those were Miki's traps."

[Miki]
"Yes. Sempai taught me how to make them."

[Taichi]
"No I didn't."

[Miki]
"It was much earlier. Dozens of weeks ago."
[Miki]
"I didn't want you to go near that place, so I was wary. The real objective was to let me know when someone came near it......with traps I could move more carefully, and there would be time to run."

[Taichi]
"......what place?"

[Miki]
"That's the only place exempted from the loop."

[Taichi]
"The loop......"

[Miki]
"The world is repeating this week over and over, Sempai."

And then Miki spoke.
Of the week from Monday to Sunday.
That the world will progress that far and then return to the situation on Monday.
Loop.
Miki called it that.

[Taichi]
"That's hard to believe."

[Miki]
"Do I have any reason to lie?"
[Miki]
"Your memory and this situation will all return to the way they were."
[Miki]
"So Kiri-chin will also recover by next week,"
[Miki]
"Of course, I think the memories of being killed will be gone by Monday, but..."

[Taichi]
"Miki, how can you be so sure that's the truth?"

[Miki]
"Because the hokora is exempt from time's progression."

[Taichi]
"......in other words......you're living in the hokora?"

[Miki]
"Just for the moment when Sunday ends."

[Taichi]
"......so, you say we're looping, but why did you kill everyone?"
//Since she's going to the hokora to avoid the loop, that statement couldn't have been right.-Spin

[Miki]
"Because I must not die."

[Taichi]
"There's no connection."

[Miki]
"......the first time I noticed the hokora, there were already notebooks inside it."
[Miki]
"In the notebooks, every day until Saturday was recorded in detail, and the writer was Sempai."

[Taichi]
"I did that......?"

[Miki]
"Despite having your memories reset every time by the loop phenomenon, Sempai and Hasekura-sempai have a pretty high probability of noticing the truth."
[Miki]
"But since you'll forget, you leave records in the form of diaries inside the hokora......well, I think you're doing it so that next week's you can grasp the situation more easily."
[Miki]
"But you didn't realize that being at the hokora would preserve proper time."
[Miki]
"......when next week comes, everyone's memories are cleared."
[Miki]
"But isn't that no different from dying and being reborn?"
[Miki]
"However many diaries you write, you have no means of making up the time lost through resets, do you?"
[Miki]
"Isn't it like dying every single time?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"I didn't like that idea."
[Miki]
"I want to live on with the same connection between all of the proper me's."
[Miki]
"Even if the world no longer continues the slightest bit......I don't want to repeat myself unknowingly."

[Taichi]
"I understand your feelings......but why did that make you kill everyone?"

[Miki]
"I told you those were all coincidences."
[Miki]
"If there are enough repeats, won't Hasekura-sempai get caught in a trap once in a while?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe once in a hundred."

[Miki]
"So, once in a long while Touko-sempai dies, and Shima-sempai dies, and Mimi-sempai dies......all at once."
[Miki]
"That happened to be this time."

[Taichi]
"The culprit......if we exempt the first case where you set the traps......was all coincidence?"

[Miki]
"Coincidence can occasionally become an invisible murderer."
[Miki]
"Within a loop world, there are occurrences certain to happen on occasion."

[Taichi]
"Who stabbed Touko?"

[Miki]
"I did."

[Taichi]
"Haa?"

[Miki]
"Touko-sempai has a high probability of starving to death every time."
[Miki]
"So, after she'd already died this time, I stabbed her corpse with a short sword."

[Taichi]
"For what reason?"

[Miki]
"......to make sure Kiri-chin's switch would flip."
[Miki]
"To make sure Kiri-chin would try to kill Sempai."

[Taichi]
"......Miki......"

[Miki]
"Ah, it's not because I hate Sempai."
[Miki]
"It's just......because you're dangerous."
[Miki]
"Don't you have a high probability of going berserk?"
[Miki]
"When you see blood, don't you often become strange?"

[Taichi]
"......yeah."

[Miki]
"I've been trying to stabilize things, and somehow I've made it until now."

[Taichi]
"......haha, you were taking care of me."

[Miki]
"Yes♪"
[Miki]
"Because I love Sempai when he's nice."

She held emotions for a moment.

[Miki]
"......but, this time there was the irregularity of Hasekura-sempai dying."

She returned to being expressionless.

[Miki]
"That person is beyond most humans, so she often finds my camp."

[Taichi]
"Your 'camp' is next to the hokora?"

[Miki]
"Yes. I borrowed stuff from the campout......ah, please don't move."

[Taichi]
"I want to stop the bleeding......"

[Miki]
"I'm sorry......I can't allow that......"

[Taichi]
"Because you're going to kill me?"

[Miki]
"......yes."

She fell silent.

[Taichi]
"......haa......how should I say it...if that's all true, I'm going to come back to life, but..."

[Miki]
"About Hasekura-sempai, I surrender right away whenever she finds me. Then I offer her information."
[Miki]
"After all, I can't possibly beat her."

[Taichi]
"You are taking care of yourself well."

[Miki]
"Your reaction when Hasekura-sempai died was entirely unknown."
[Miki]
"......Kiri-chin became neurotically malicious as well, but that was going to happen at some point."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's true."

[Miki]
"I cannot die."
[Miki]
"Just as you say......I care about myself...a lot."
[Miki]
"More than anyone."

[Taichi]
"............I get it."
[Taichi]
"So that's Miki's ultramarine."

[Miki]
"......yes, that would be it."
(TL Note: The "Gunjou" in "Gunjou Institute" literally means the color "ultramarine." This meaning can be specified by saying "Gunjou-iro (Gunjou-colored)" as Taichi does here.)
[Miki]
"I don't understand people's pain at all."
[Miki]
"It's like living while pretending to be a person."
[Miki]
"Those are words Kiri-chin once used to reproach Sempai."

[Taichi]
"......though I don't remember them."

[Miki]
"Ah, well things have gone that way before."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, for me before the reset."

[Miki]
"Sempai isn't mimicking anything."
[Miki]
"You're just......trying to be a person."
[Miki]
"So, the one who really was mimicking and being a parasite......was me."

[Taichi]
"......you can't just hide in the hokora forever, can you?"

[Miki]
"......that would be nice, but......"
[Miki]
"I'm going to go mad from boredom, you know?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah......that's true......"

[Miki]
"Maintaining everyone's state of mind, negotiating with Hasekura-sempai, being careful not to......I'm repeating those things endlessly."

[Taichi]
"Must be rough."

[Miki]
"But, when I'm doing those things, I stay as the innocent me......being stupid with Sempai......being in the club with everyone......"

[Taichi]
"......if your subjective time is protected by being at the hokora......what happens when Miki becomes an adult?"

[Miki]
"......I haven't thought about it."
[Miki]
"Though there will probably come a time where I have to be reset."
[Miki]
"Because......I'm already a different person......"

[Taichi]
"Are you scared?"

[Miki]
"I'm scared."
[Miki]
"I'm scared of no longer being myself."

Tears flowed.

[Miki]
"I'm scared to disappear...in this world with no one in it."
[Miki]
"......but..."
[Miki]
"For some reason...I get the feeling I'm all alone."

[Taichi]
"............"

[Miki]
"Somehow...it's all gotten hollow."

Miki lowered her weapon.

[Miki]
"By talking to Sempai now...it's gotten even more hollow."

[Taichi]
"Yep. Because this was as long a talk as something the principal would give."

[Miki]
"......you're not acting scared at all."

[Taichi]
"That was a very interesting story."

[Miki]
"......ahaha......Sempai really is a more amazing person than me."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan's on a completely different level."

[Miki]
"That person......she's close to perfect, but......but she isn't a well-rounded person, is she?"
[Miki]
"You're different."
[Miki]
"You're the same as me, but you have more to deal with, and yet you work several times harder than I do."
//"Me" was used right before that. I decided it was better to do this or make that first part a seperate sentence.-Spin
[Miki]
"You don't give up."

She came closer.

[Miki]
"Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Miki]
"You are...the first person...I ever fell in love with."

[Taichi]
"Aaah...I'm honored."

I closed my eyes.
So I'd be easier to kill.
And then,

[Miki]
"......farewell...see you next week."

[Taichi]
"Next week."

I closed my consciousness.
