[Taichi]
"It...It's all good."

[Touko]
"Eh?!"

The one who'd put the idea forth was surprised.

[Touko]
"It's...it's okay?"

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"There's no way I can let Touko starve to death."

[Touko]
"For now......"

[Taichi]
"Otherwise, the Hungry Harakiri Wolf possessed by the temptation of food would be released from the bonds of this world."

[Touko]
"............"

I defended myself.

[Taichi]
"......nn?"

No attack came.

[Touko]
"Ah, umm, I'll bring a change of clothes right away!"

[Taichi]
"What?!"

[Touko]
"I'll be right back!"

She ran away.

[Taichi]
"Ueitsu! (Wait!)"

I grabbed her ankles.
*smack!*

[Touko]
"Obuobuobu......"

Touko kissed the ground.
Good thing this is grass.

[Taichi]
"Good thing this is grass."

We drew near each other through our true intentions.

[Touko]
"My nose......the nose I shape every day wif clothespins......"

You've done that?

[Touko]
"Wut're yu doin!!?"

[Taichi]
"Are you really going to live here?"

[Touko]
"I will! It's already been decided!"

[Taichi]
"Yet you won't even show your shame......"
[Taichi]
"When it comes to others you're a competitive girl who beats the crap out of everyone, but your sculpted features aside, around me you shall be a strange and conveniently flattering heroine!!!"

[Touko]
"......I don't understand."

I brushed my bangs aside.

[Taichi]
"Even though you were praiseworthy until just a moment ago!"

[Touko]
"But now that I have your pledge, there's no longer any need to sweeten the deal."

[Taichi]
"Aaah! Aaaaaaaaah! You tricked meee!!"

[Touko]
"Since there aren't any police, I'll be able to carry my blade openly."

[Taichi]
"---!?"

That Demon Harakiri Blade in my house!?

[Taichi]
"Hiiiiiiii! Someone!! There's a warrior girl here who's incredibly good with her blade!!!"

[Touko]
"There's no 'someone' left."

That's right!

[Touko]
"Besides, if you think about it, this is a just and proper civil right."

[Taichi]
"Eh!?"

[Touko]
"If you can't handle that, then give 'it' back."

*slip*
My hand was broken through.

[Taichi]
"I've already returned 『The 18-Year-Old Perverted Little Sister Next Door』......"

[Touko]
"I never loaned you an erotic video!"
[Touko]
"Something more important. Come on, give it back."

*s-slip!*
Something more important.

[Taichi]
"I should've returned 『Extreme School Bloomer Twirls』 too......"

[Touko]
"I didn't loan you any 'special interest' videos either!!!"
[Touko]
"My precious thing! That you stole!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah."

I nodded deeply.

[Taichi]
"What was it?"

[Touko]
"Do you have dementia!?"
[Touko]
"........................it's my virginity."

[Taichi]
"Hymen?"

*ka-blam!*

[Touko]
"Go change your eardrums!!!"

[Taichi]
"Gyaa."

Reckless Courage Bursting Explosion.

[Touko]
"Anyway I'll live here! I'll live around here! I'll live in here! I'll live up here......I'll live in here! It's decided! Ratified!"

[Taichi]
"You've got a majority with only half!!?"

[Touko]
"I'll be coming here with my things very soon!"

She turned on her heels.

[Taichi]
"Wait, wait."

[Touko]
"You're not done yet?"

[Taichi]
"......nnn."

Is there nothing I can do to stop this?

[Taichi]
"......somehow......I'm starting to see your point......yeah, okay."

[Touko]
"You're mumbling."

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'll recognize your immigration."
[Taichi]
"However, it doesn't have to be today. Why not tomorrow?"
[Taichi]
"I'll have to clean my room after all."

[Touko]
"Th-that's true......"

[Taichi]
"If you wait until tomorrow, I'll help you carry your stuff."

[Touko]
"Really?"

Touko's smile suddenly turned on.

[Taichi]
"......yeah."

My acting skills have......

[Touko]
"Either way, I have to go home and prepare things."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Touko]
"I'm going home."

She left with a spring in her step.

[Touko]
"See you tomorrow then. I'll go to school as usual."

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

[Touko]
"Make sure you come!"

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

Touko was getting smaller and smaller.
The whole time I was waving my hand.
This is getting troublesome......
