[Taichi]
"It...It's all good."

[Touko]
"Eh?!"

The one who'd put the idea forth was surprised.

[Touko]
"It's...it's okay?"

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"There's no way I can let Touko starve to death."

[Touko]
"For now......"

[Taichi]
"Otherwise, the Hungry Harakiri Wolf possessed by the temptation of food would be released from the bonds of this world."

[Touko]
"............"

I defended myself.
//Shouldn't it be Taichi since he just made a statement about Touko?-Spin

[Taichi]
"......nn?"

No attack came.

[Touko]
"Ah, umm, I'll bring a change of clothes right away!"

[Taichi]
"What?!"

[Touko]
"I'll be right back!"

She ran away.

[Taichi]
"Ueitsu! (Wait!)"

I grabbed her ankles.
*smack!*

[Touko]
"Obuobuobu......"

Touko kissed the ground.
Good thing this is grass.

[Taichi]
"Good thing this is grass."

We drew near each other through our true intentions.

[Touko]
"My nose......the nose I shape every day wif clothespins......"
//She's referring to one of many ways people make various body parts grow differently through very long and frequent applications of pressure. Lip discs are the only one I know the name of. The point being, if anyone can adapt this better to make that intent more obvious, please do so. 〜IX
//I think the point is brought across nicely. I also like that it's her nose, which may be the cause of her "distinct intonation" XD - pondrthis

You've done that?

[Touko]
"Wut're yu doin!!?"

[Taichi]
"Are you really going to live here?"

[Touko]
"I will! It's already been decided!"

[Taichi]
"Yet you won't even show your shame......"
[Taichi]
"When it comes to others you're a competitive girl who beats the crap out of everyone, but your sculpted features aside, around me you shall be a strange and conveniently flattering heroine!!!"

[Touko]
"......I don't understand."

I brushed my bangs aside.
//I'm starting to imagine this movement with the classic anime sparkles and other exaggerations 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Even though you were praiseworthy until just a moment ago!"

[Touko]
"But now that I have your pledge, there's no longer any need to sweeten the deal."

[Taichi]
"Aaah! Aaaaaaaaah! You tricked meee!!"

[Touko]
"Since there aren't any police, I'll be able to carry my blade openly."

[Taichi]
"---!?"

That Demon Harakiri Blade in my house!?

[Taichi]
"Hiiiiiiii! Someone!! There's a warrior girl here who's incredibly good with her blade!!!"

[Touko]
"There's no 'someone' left."

That's right!

[Touko]
"Besides, if you think about it, this is a just and proper civil right."

[Taichi]
"Eh!?"

[Touko]
"If you can't handle that, then give 'it' back."

*slip*
My hand was broken through.

[Taichi]
"I've already returned 『The 18-Year-Old Perverted Little Sister Next Door』......"
//"little sister" should be together, I think, and I added an extra hyphen there - pondrthis
//It's the title of a video right? Added the capitalization because it made me think he was being literal also.-Spin

[Touko]
"I never loaned you an erotic video!"
[Touko]
"Something more important. Come on, give it back."

*s-slip!*
Something more important.

[Taichi]
"I should've returned 『Extreme School Bloomer Twirls』 too......"
//Wth...you capitalized this one but not that other one...-Spin

[Touko]
"I didn't loan you any 'special interest' videos either!!!"
//The flow of that sentence went way too fast. It made me wonder why she said "either" when it was also a video. Added those to make it stand out.-Spin
[Touko]
"My precious thing! That you stole!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah."

I nodded deeply.

[Taichi]
"What was it?"

[Touko]
"Do you have dementia!?"
[Touko]
"........................it's my virginity."

[Taichi]
"Hymen?"
//The "hymen" would be the part linked to virginity. If "vulva" was used in Japanese though, then just change it back.-Spin

*ka-blam!*

[Touko]
"Go change your eardrums!!!"

[Taichi]
"Gyaa."

Reckless Courage Bursting Explosion.
//enjoy adapting further. 〜IX
//Done, now it's her special move. Probably not what you're looking for but works just as well.-Spin

[Touko]
"Anyway I'll live here! I'll live around here! I'll live in here! I'll live up here......I'll live in here! It's decided! Ratified!"

[Taichi]
"You've got a majority with only half!!?"

[Touko]
"I'll be coming here with my things very soon!"

She turned on her heels.

[Taichi]
"Wait, wait."

[Touko]
"You're not done yet?"

[Taichi]
"......nnn."

Is there nothing I can do to stop this?
//I think this is a little better. - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"......somehow......I'm starting to see your point......yeah, okay."

[Touko]
"You're mumbling."

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'll recognize your immigration."
[Taichi]
"However, it doesn't have to be today. Why not tomorrow?"
[Taichi]
"I'll have to clean my room after all."

[Touko]
"Th-that's true......"

[Taichi]
"If you wait until tomorrow, I'll help you carry your stuff."

[Touko]
"Really?"

Touko's smile suddenly turned on.

[Taichi]
"......yeah."

My acting skills have......

[Touko]
"Either way, I have to go home and prepare things."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Touko]
"I'm going home."

She left with a spring in her step.

[Touko]
"See you tomorrow then. I'll go to school as usual."

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

[Touko]
"Make sure you come!"

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

Touko was getting smaller and smaller.
The whole time I was waving my hand.
This is getting troublesome......
