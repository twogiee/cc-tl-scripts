As usual, Touko was absentmindedly sitting in the classroom.
Not talking to anyone.
Not participating in the club.
Just simply being there, with no objective.

[Taichi]
"......"

She's correct.
Fulfilled as a person.
Everything had disappeared suddenly.
She has inertia, but she has to power herself.
It's ironic if you think about it.
All the decent humans went and got annihilated all at once, leaving only us behind.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara."

[Touko]
"......"

Hmmm.

[Taichi]
"Dialogue."

[Touko]
"?"

Her face became dubious for a moment, but quickly closed itself off into a private train of thought (or so it seemed).

[Taichi]
"Dialogue!"

I moaned like a zombie.

[Taichi]
"Dialogue, dialogue."
[Taichi]
"Dialogue!"

[Touko]
"What is it with you!!?"

A monster of dialogue.
No, a monster-like dialogue.
......wha?
Whatever.

[Taichi]
"Conversation conversation dialogue dialogue needed needed."

I emphasized it by adding body language.

[Touko]
"......not needed."

[Taichi]
"It won't come to be without dialogue."

[Touko]
"......I don't understand."
[Touko]
"Don't talk to me."
[Touko]
"Aren't I completely meaningless to you!?"

[Taichi]
"That's not true."
[Taichi]
"I like Kirihara when she snaps."

[Touko]
"Is that it!? Do you just want a toy to play with!!?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Touko]
"Liar!"

[Taichi]
"It's true."

[Touko]
"But, but, but......"

She was hard-pressed for words.

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me."

Her furious argument halted for the moment.
An incomplete combustion.
If you tell me not to talk to you with such a bitter tongue, that just makes me want to talk more.
But when I speak to her again, her bitter tongue once more tells me not to talk.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."
