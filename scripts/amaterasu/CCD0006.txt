"......"

A spinning world...
How many times have I repeated this Monday?
As I thought such things,
I discovered Miki.
And she discovered me.

[Taichi]
"Heeey, Miki Mou---"
//Is it obvious enough that Miki and Mickey sound similar? 〜IX
//In my country, Mickey is localized to Miki - Raide
//Yep - Sheeta

At the moment I tried to use a potentially copyright-infringing gag,
She rushed.
Toward me.
While stumbling.

[Taichi]
"Wa! Sorry! My bad! I didn't know the Sonny Bono Law was constitutional!"
//Not going to bother mentioning that opponents tried to get it declared unconstitutional, since anyone familiar with American government will have figured that out by now. 〜IX

[Miki]
"Uwaaaaaaan!!!"
(TL Note: A US copyright extension resolution infamous for delaying Disney characters' entry into the public domain by twenty years.)

She cried.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong!!?"

She leaped into my chest.
I caught her.

[Miki]
"Sempai, Sempai-Sempai-Sempaaaaaai!!!"

She blubbered.

[Miki]
"There's no one hereeeeeee!! Something's straaaaaaange! This absolutely isn't normaaaaaaal!!!"

Weak!!!
Is this what it means to have too few experience points?

[Miki]
"No one's in any of the houses! There's hardly anyone left, they've all disappeared!!"

[Taichi]
"D-didn't we figure that out last night?"

I consoled her while patting her back.
I'm weak against a girl's tears.

[Miki]
"But, but!"

[Taichi]
"Aren't I here?"

[Miki]
"......uuuuu! Yes......thank goodness......you're here......"

Although that was a joke.

[Miki]
"I woke up this morning, and mom wasn't there, and breakfast wasn't there......when I thought that everyone really had disappeared......"
//Were we tling okaa-san as "mom" or just romanizing it? I can't remember. 〜IX
//Capital 'Mom'? - Raide
//I can't remember... it doesn't need a capital, either way - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"Were you scared?"

She nodded as if to rub her forehead against me.

[Miki]
"I don't like this......I...don't......"

I looked up at the sky.

[Taichi]
"It really is lonely without other people."

[Miki]
"......I want to go home......"

She said something sharp.
That this wasn't our original world.
It was world'.
//Anyone have a better idea for adaptation, I'm all ears. 〜IX
//We could write it as world' (prime)? - Sheeta
Miki's words were probably a coincidence, but...
(TL Note: Since it's not as clear in English, the apostrophe here is the mathematical symbol pronounced "prime" used to label geometrical shapes that have undergone some sort of transformation.)
They hit the target.

[Taichi]
"You want to go home......"

[Miki]
"I wanna go home, I wanna go home......"

[Taichi]
"That's a problem, what should we do?"

There's a way to console Miki.
A slightly cruel way.
A method I can use because we're similar people.
Because we're limited to one week.
I can do anything.
Like someone living their life to the fullest without regrets.
This week's proper us have to hurry up and live.
The moment when I thought up a number of captivating words to invite Miki,
A kick came.

[Kiri]
"Shaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

[Taichi]
"Gaaa!!"

Kiri's kick plucked me off of Miki.

[Taichi]
"What're you doing!?"

[Kiri]
"Please cease your lecherous conduct!"

[Taichi]
"I'm no lecher!"

[Kiri]
"You're 100% a lecher."

[Taichi]
"I said I'm no lecher!"

[Miki]
"Haaa, Kiri-chin......"

Miki was depressed.
She grabbed onto Kiri.
//The "and" really didn't need to be there.-Spin

[Miki]
"Fueeeeeeeeeeen!!"

[Kiri]
"You're fine, it's all right now."

Huh?

[Taichi]
"Miki......won't you explain my innocence?"

[Miki]
"Egu! *hic!* Uku!"

She's sobbing.
Instead, Kiri glared sharply at me.

[Kiri]
"......I won't forgive you."
[Kiri]
"I absolutely won't forgive a lecher!"

[Taichi]
"That's not it!"

[Kiri]
"Miki crying is the proof."

[Taichi]
"Hey hey hey hey."

This is no joke.
Are you going to frame me like this?
I have to run.
Dash!

[Kiri]
"Aaah! He ran!"
