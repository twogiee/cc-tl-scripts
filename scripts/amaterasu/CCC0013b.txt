[Taichi]
"Hello, Miss Innocence."

Her whole body stiffened.
Stress covered her back.
She slowly turned to face me.
In the midst of those slow movements, she barely took up an offensive posture.
When she turned around, her gaze was stern.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Kiri]
"......what do you want?"

She spoke.
In the lowest possible voice.

[Taichi]
"I don't want anything, but---"

[Kiri]
"In that case,"

Kiri said, cutting off my words,

[Kiri]
"Go ahead and retire."
