Tomoki was fixing the camouflage on the hallway-facing window.

[Taichi]
"Heeey."

[Tomoki]
"Uu, Taichi......"

He moved away from the window, embarrassed.
The club room was built with a window on the side facing the hallway.
So that one could conduct surveillance from the outside.
You can figure out why.

[Taichi]
"......is there any meaning in fixing it?"

[Tomoki]
"It bothered me. There's no particular meaning to it."

Meaningless...huh...
That's certainly true. In practical terms.
But what about with regards to the heart?

[Tomoki]
"Stiiill, there really isn't anyone here."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, it seems like it really is just us eight."

[Tomoki]
"But still, this is just......"

That's right, Tomoki hated Mimi-sempai.
Even though she's his sister.
There seem to be a lot of circumstances causing their surnames to be different.
Family matters.

[Taichi]
"Were you serious last night?"

[Tomoki]
"Nn?"

[Taichi]
"When you said you would handle the food problem."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, I'll get on that this afternoon. I just came to see what was going on at school."

[Taichi]
"Food..."

It's not needed.
The world's going to revolve in a week anyway.
Even if I died, I'd recover.

[Taichi]
"......"

My heart quivered.
No good......
I have to calm down.

[Taichi]
"Friendship wishes for-"

[Tomoki]
"Nothing."

Gu!
We gave each other a thumbs-up.

[Tomoki]
"......you're sudden."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"Nn?"

[Taichi]
"Are you......fighting with Mimi-sempai?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah......"

[Taichi]
"Is that going to continue even in these times?"

[Tomoki]
"......not really."

He darkened.

[Tomoki]
"I don't care about that person."

Tough words.

[Taichi]
"Though you seem to destroy a lot of things quarreling with her about manga and such."

Tomoki made a horribly sullen face.
