[Miki]
"Uuooooo, it stings when I shake it..."

[Taichi]
"Bear with it. I'm summoning a famous doctor now."

I opened the window and whistled.
Come here! Youko!

[Taichi]
"............"

She won't come.
I whistled once more.
Come here!! Youko!!

[Taichi]
"........................"

Huuuh?

[Miki]
"My arm is torn so badly."

[Taichi]
"Awawa."

There's no choice, I have to dress the wound.
I rolled up her sleeve.
I looked at the open wound.

[Taichi]
"Uu......"

The smell of blood really is harsh.
I put a laundry clothespin on my nose.

[Miki]
"What's that?"

[Taichi]
"Diz zhud rurk (This should work)."
//as usual, feel free to try other ways of adapting this. 〜IX

[Miki]
"......that couldn't be part of the treatment... could it?"

She accepted it on her own.
Ummm......first, water......
I washed off the blood with water from the drinking fountain.
I was relieved.

[Miki]
"........................"

Miki gazed at me intently, as if trying to conjecture something.
Disinfectant......

[Miki]
"Migyaa."

It seems to have gotten in there.
A little more.

[Miki]
"Hagyaaa."

Is this it?
Gauze.
Bandages.
Tying bandages.
I rolled her sleeve back down.

[Taichi]
*sigh*

I don't need the clothespin anymore.

[Taichi]
"Op finished."
//yes, "op" is short for "operation" 〜IX

[Miki]
"......it stings. It feels like the wound is going numb."

[Taichi]
"That's love."

[Miki]
"Th-this is love?"

[Taichi]
"And true love at that. Your love meter is at eighty nine percent. There's no mistaking it."
//I know that's a rewrite but I didn't understand what "good feelings" meant.-Spin

[Miki]
"Iii seee. This is love......"

[Taichi]
"How does it feel for your love to blossom?"

[Miki]
"......I don't know. My life hasn't had love before."

[Taichi]
"Ku! You're making me cry."

[Miki]
"Now that I think about it, I'm sorry, Sempai, that you had to do this when blood is a weakness of yours."

[Taichi]
"What? There's no doctor here, so injuries are a big deal. Take care of yourself."

[Miki]
"I do take......great care of myself......"

[Taichi]
"Then all is well."

[Miki]
"I'll have to thank you somehow."

[Taichi]
"You could give me a pair of underwear."

[Miki]
"......uuuooo, that's expensiiive......"

[Taichi]
"It was a joke. Kiri-chin would kill me."

[Miki]
"Is there some other commodity you desire?"

[Taichi]
"Nnn, I already took your first kiss..."

[Miki]
"Gu, that's right......"

Miki-Miki received a shock.

[Taichi]
"Make it a memory."

[Miki]
"I shall live on holding that memory whether I want to or not......"
[Miki]
"What about something that isn't erotic?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm......date......"

A flash of inspiration.

[Taichi]
"Double date."

[Miki]
"Eh? With who?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah...me, Miki and Kiri-chin."

[Miki]
"Isn't that just double girls?"

[Taichi]
"So, please harass me enough for two."

[Miki]
"Well, if you're fine with that."

[Taichi]
"It's okay?"

[Miki]
"It's okay."

A flower in both hands.

[Miki]
"......I was feeling like I'd have nooo ideeea what to do if I was going alone, but if Kiri-chin's with me I'm totally okay."

[Taichi]
"It seems I'll be targeted."

[Miki]
"You wiiill."
[Miki]
"Because Sempai is dangerouuus."

[Taichi]
"Hahahahaha."

However, Miki doesn't know.
That I really am dangerous.
Urges.
At times, they rouse.
I'm fighting against them.

[Taichi]
"I really have caused a lot of trouble for Mikicchi."

[Miki]
"?"

[Taichi]
"You saved me on Monday as well......thank you."

[Miki]
"......nn...well......that was just..."

[Taichi]
"You moved so well when you saved Kiri-chin that I thought you were a different person."
[Taichi]
"I really did......"

So nimble that I could easily make that mistake.
But...were Miki's senses that sharp?
What about when she carried me back to my house?
Is she that strong?

[Taichi]
"Come to think of it......your kicks were sharp too......"

I started thinking.
Something bugged me.

[Miki]
"Uh, ummm."

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Miki]
......*kiss*

On my cheek.
The first time it's been done to me by anyone but Youko-chan.

[Miki]
"An advance payment on my thanks!"

[Taichi]
"Y-y-you allured me, so I'm going to do this!!"

I jumped onto Miki.
