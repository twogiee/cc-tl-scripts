"......still..."

It's a manuscript.
If that got rejected, how am I supposed to write another?
My hand didn't move.
My pen didn't run.
Standstill.

[Taichi]
"Uuumumumu."

That's right.
I pulled a kinagashi out of my dresser and changed into it.

[Taichi]
"......a great writer is born."
(TL Note: "Kinagashi" means a kimono without the usual hakama worn underneath, so it's something like a bathrobe.)

One's mood is important.
(TL Note: A "kimono" is a traditional, but nowadays a ceremonial, robe with collars and full-length sleeves, which extends down to the ankles. A "hakama" is basically a hand-tied, ankle-length skirt worn under it.))
When doing something like this.

[Tomoki]
"Heeey!"

I heard a voice from the front door.

[Taichi]
"Something up?"

[Tomoki]
"Uwa......Taichi?"

Tomoki seemed to be shocked at the sudden appearance of the kimono man.

[Tomoki]
"What a face......"

[Taichi]
"Leave it."

[Tomoki]
"I made a mistake. But that outfit......"

[Taichi]
"Are you sure you were mistaken?"

[Tomoki]
"That's a Japanese kimono, isn't it?"

[Taichi]
"It's also a Japanese priest's outfit."

[Tomoki]
"A priest......amazing."
[Tomoki]
"Do you always wear that?"

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"Of course."

[Tomoki]
"Amazing."

It seems Tomoki respects me all the more now.
Though this is only the second time I've worn it.

[Taichi]
"So, what's with the late night visit?"

[Tomoki]
"Well......the reason is right here......this is Taichi's share."

A cardboard box.
I accepted it.

[Taichi]
"This is heavy."

[Tomoki]
"It's been filled up."

[Taichi]
"The inside......it's too dark to see properly."

[Tomoki]
"A gift from the club. Since it's summer, keeping all this in the club room will just make it rot."

[Taichi]
"Some kind of food?"

[Tomoki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Thank you."

[Tomoki]
"No, don't mention it."
[Tomoki]
"Besides, friendship asks for---"

[Taichi]
"Nothing at all."

Gu!
We laughed invincibly with our thumbs up.

[Taichi]
"Kurosu Taichi is a pure young boy supporting Shima Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"No, no..."
[Tomoki]
"Ah, that's right."

His face tightened.

[Tomoki]
"Kirihara...she collapsed."

[Taichi]
"......say what?"

[Tomoki]
"More accurately, she'd been collapsing."

[Taichi]
"But she's a user of the Harakiri Fist...defeating even my karade should be simple."

[Tomoki]
"Not defeated, collapsed. And I have no idea what 'karade' is."
(TL Note: In Japanese, "to collapse" and "to be defeated" are the same word.)
[Tomoki]
"About that......Sakuraba's looking after her right now, but he's obviously not that good at it, so......I was wondering if you could get Hasekura-sempai to watch over her."

[Taichi]
"Aah, no problem."

[Tomoki]
"Can you ask her right away?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. In that case, I'll be heading out for a bit."

I put my sandals on and went to her house.
When I came back, Tomoki was still there.

[Taichi]
"She said sure. She's already on her way."

[Tomoki]
"......so fast..."
[Tomoki]
"She really listens to what you have to say, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Because if she didn't, a lot of errors would occur."

[Tomoki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, would you like to come upstairs and play some PC-98 games?"

Not that I have any.

[Taichi]
"Since you were in charge of disk swaps."

[Tomoki]
"What's a PC-98? Some kind of Wind**s?"

[Taichi]
"Please say that's a lie, my friend."

[Tomoki]
"......I have failed to understand you."

Tomoki's gags were all like this.

[Taichi]
"You really don't know the PC-98?"

Despite being a computer nerd.

[Tomoki]
"At the very least, I've never heard of it before."

[Taichi]
"......I guess that makes sense......no, I wasn't in that generation either, but......"
[Taichi]
"Anyway, Tomoki, that comment's going to make you enemies with all the old computer nerds born since the fortieth year of Shouwa."

[Tomoki]
"Well......that doesn't scare me at all......"
(TL Note: Shouwa = the period from 1926 to 1989, so the fortieth year of Shouwa was 1966.)
[Tomoki]
"Besides, I'm not going to watch out for each and every one of the primitive men who match one-hundred percent to the archetype of an old man born in an era as old as Shouwa."

[Taichi]
"---!?"

My fear was aroused.

[Taichi]
"You can't say things like that---!!"

[Tomoki]
"Why not?"

Tomoki had yet to know fear.

[Taichi]
"Th-that's what they call youth, right? Right? Hopeless youth really is scary, Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"What I mean is......why can't we just let the old guys stick to their old guy communities spiraling into eternal conversations about Gun**m and the like?"

[Taichi]
"Hiiiiiiiiiiiii!!?"
(TL Note: The Gundam metafranchise includes over a dozen mecha anime series going back to 1979.)

My lifespan shrunk.
(TL Note: "Mecha anime" are anime series revolving around "mecha," or giant fighting robots.))
