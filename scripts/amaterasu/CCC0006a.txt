Later, when I started walking down the hill,

[Taichi]
"Mu!?"

The sound of a tire scraping against the ground.
A sign of danger.

[Taichi]
"You think that'll work!!?"

I jumped back gracefully.
*impact!*

[Taichi]
"Propellererererererererer!!!"

I rotated.

[Nanaka]
"Nyaiiiiiiiiiii!!?"

I was blown away with Hollywood wirework.
Without losing any energy when crashing my face into the ground, I rolled forth and collided into the trees by the side of the road in the posture of a shachihoko.

[Nanaka]
"Sorry Taichi!!"
(TL Note: A "shachihoko" is a mythical tiger-headed carp usually depicted with its tail raised up in the air.)

[Taichi]
"......how do you know my name......"

[Nanaka]
"Did you forget?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

The girl's eyes met mine.

[Nanaka]
"Did you forget about me?"

[Taichi]
"Gulp."

I forgot.
In my amnesia,
A long time ago, she saved my life.
Incishoot.
*Incishoot = Taichian for incidental + shoot (i.e., anything in wrestling that isn't staged). It refers to a posture that challenges one head on; the most typical of the typical.

[Taichi]
"I can only permit something on a slightly mysterious level, you hear? Like a childhood friend-chan who promised to marry you ten years ago returning."

I informed her with a hard-boiled tone.

[Nanaka]
"Hu! Hu! Hu!"

A cute girl.
Though she's a little weird.
Or I should say, she's obviously weird.
But she's cute (failure as a human).
Am I going to sexually harass someone I just met?

[Taichi]
"Aaand..."

*squeeze*
Breast Get!

[Nanaka]
"......"

[Taichi]
"......nnn?"

*squeeze* *squeeze*
There's a sensation.
But......what is this feeling...

[Taichi]
"Could this be silicone? Don't tell me it's silicone!"

[Nanaka]
"Moron!"

*smack!*

[Taichi]
"Moron!"

And she'd just sent me flying.

[Taichi]
"......so, what's your name?"

[Nanaka]
"You recover quickly."

[Taichi]
"I'm used to this."

[Nanaka]
"My name is Nanaka."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka-chan?"

[Nanaka]
"Yep, Nanaka-chan."

She held up her skirt in a refined greeting pose.
I did the same.
Mirrored.
......an idiot's reflection...was the scene I'd made.

[Taichi]
"......anyway, I'm going to school, so let's start walking."

[Nanaka]
"Okaaay."

A uniform I'd never seen before.
It's not from any neighboring school.
She seemed to have good motor skills.
Even though I'm walking at slow speed, she's matching my pace without faltering.
She came across as a lively, energetic, childhood-friend- type pretty girl.
Who'd come and wake me up every morning.

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu."

Wonderful.

[Nanaka]
"Does it disturb you much?"

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Nanaka]
"The world coming to this."

[Taichi]
"......it does."

There's no way it wouldn't.

[Taichi]
"I'm just not letting it show."
[Taichi]
"I......the fewer people there are, the more I become like myself."

[Nanaka]
"............"

[Taichi]
"But I'm holding on for now because I know everyone's still here."

[Nanaka]
"I see..."
[Nanaka]
"Taichi hates himself."

[Taichi]
"......it's not that I hate myself......I don't really know."
[Taichi]
"I really don't know anymore. I'm just thinking about trivial things all the time."
[Taichi]
"......it's a little painful."

Nanaka made a sad face.

[Taichi]
"Oh! We can't have that."

I tried to go against the situation by being funny.

[Taichi]
"I decided that I will only make girls cry with sexual harassment."

I wiped the corner of her eye.

[Nanaka]
"......I'm not crying."

[Taichi]
"You looked like you were about to."

[Nanaka]
"And sexual harassment is the worst."

[Taichi]
"It's an expression of love."

[Nanaka]
"Perverted pranks are?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

I puffed up my chest.

[Taichi]
"I perform perverted pranks with an atmosphere of admiration for something beautiful."
[Taichi]
"After all, no matter how formulaic an individual, it is that person's one and only."
[Taichi]
"Because that's how humans are."
[Taichi]
"Besides, I have no right to love people with a serious face......"

I just let something slip.
Since even I'm human, there are extremely rare times without any context where my guard falls.
What to do, what to do...

[Nanaka]
"......hmmm."
[Nanaka]
"That's the first time I've heard that opinion."

[Taichi]
"......the first time?"
[Taichi]
"Have we really met before?"

[Nanaka]
"We have."

A face hiding loneliness.

[Taichi]
"When."

[Nanaka]
"Dunno."

[Taichi]
"......so it's a secret."

[Nanaka]
"Maybe it is."

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu, if you don't come clean, I'll flip your skirt."

[Nanaka]
"If you do that, I'll hit you again."
[Nanaka]
"Taichi must like that."

[Taichi]
"......nuu."

Formidable.
She won't be moved by sexual harassment.

[Taichi]
"......I give up."

[Nanaka]
"Oya?"

[Taichi]
"It's boring to flip the skirt of someone who won't be moved by it."
[Taichi]
"Aaaah, the Kurosu Taichi-sama whose merit lies in superficial and hollow dialogues has spoken on a serious topic..."

And so, I walked on.

[Nanaka]
"It's lonely."

I heard her voice from far behind me.
Something felt wrong.
I turned around.
An impossible distance.
Nanaka had been next to me until three seconds ago.
Twenty meters. Not a distance one could traverse in an instant.

[Taichi]
"Wh-......?"

[Nanaka]
"......Taichiii!"

She screamed. A grievous echo. It hit my heart.
This time, Nanaka was crying.

[Nanaka]
"I may not know whether that's a good thing or not!"
[Nanaka]
"But if you wish that the world would go back to the way it was......!"

A white fingertip shot out, pointing to me.
No, to something behind me.
The school.
No......the mountains?
There was a mountain path that we used during the campout.
There are a lot of animals on that path, but it reaches the summit quickly.
And at the end of it.
There's a hokora.
I don't know what's enshrined there.
A small, old, decayed hokora.
A place that might be dedicated to an unworshipped god.
No one goes near it any more.
There's something there.
I returned my gaze to Nanaka, in order to ask her a trivial question.
She'd disappeared.
Along with her bike.

[Taichi]
"............"

The cicadas weren't chirping. A quiet new term.
