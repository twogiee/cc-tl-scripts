I think I was the first to talk to Miki.
She was a lovely little lamb chased out of her original school and brought to Gunjou.
The first day.
She didn't bring anything which could be called lunch......I think.
I got that information via Miyuki, who'd become Miki's classmate, and immediately went in search of her.
In order to set up a coincidental meeting.
In front of the main gate, closed so as to not cause trouble for the neighbors.
Miki had been standing there at her wit's end.

[Taichi]
"Hiiii!"

[Miki]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"You're rather cute. What's wrong? Something seems to be troubling you."

Opening relations.

[Miki]
"Uh, umm......no......"

[Taichi]
"What is it? If there's something you don't understand, just ask the Gunjou Thesaurus, Kurosu-kun. I'll teach you lots of synonyms. Though I don't know what any of them mean."

Opening relations.

[Miki]
"Umm......then just this one."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Miki]
"Why are you wearing a gas mask?"

[Taichi]
"It's fashion!"

For some reason, I don't want to show my face.
//This is the kind of less than half a breath kind of pause.-Spin
It seems to be a kind of dysmorphic complex.

[Miki]
"Your hair is white."

[Taichi]
"It's dyed."

*shukou* *shukou*

[Taichi]
"More importantly, isn't there something else you should be more concerned about?"

[Miki]
"The gate's closed......so I can't go buy lunch..."

[Taichi]
"Hmph. What did your previous school do?"

[Miki]
"They provided lunches for us."

[Taichi]
"Cinderella girl, I feel sorry for you, but this gate won't open."
[Taichi]
"Students may not go outside during working hours."

[Miki]
"Eh......but......when I went to the cafeteria everything was sold out."

[Taichi]
"Because everyone has strong instincts. Victory to the speedy."

[Miki]
"......I see......thank you."

She returned to the school building.

[Taichi]
"Wait right there."

*shukou* *shukou*

[Taichi]
"I have bread here that's delicious despite a slightly suspicious expiration date. How about it? Will you eat with me?"

Miki's face showed that she was more puzzled than bothered.

[Miki]
"......no, that's too much."

[Taichi]
"Don't hold back. There's no need to."

[Miki]
"I can't accept an invitation from someone I just met......umm, really, it's fine......thank you."

[Taichi]
"Well...well won't skipping lunch make the afternoon unpleasant?"
//Originally I just took out that second comma but then it looked weird. I did it because that second comma wasn't exactly needed and it confused me a little bit about what he meant the first time I read it.-Spin

[Miki]
"I'm sorry."

A clear rejection.

[Taichi]
"......okay. Then I'll do this. I'll give you food so please give me something in return."

[Miki]
"............"

She looked to me as if she was thinking about how to run away.
She gave up, and said,

[Miki]
"Something in return?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. Your panties."

She walked away.

[Taichi]
"It was a joke!"

[Miki]
"Umm......are you toying with me by any chance?"

[Taichi]
"I want you to toy with me."

[Miki]
"I feel like I'm being made fun of......"

[Taichi]
"It's okay. I'm also an idiot."

*shukou* *shukou*

[Miki]
"......I don't feel like giving someone else my panties."

[Taichi]
"Then what may I take from you?"

[Miki]
"Would you be okay with anything?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

My eyes shone aggressively.

[Miki]
"Such as letting me use you for whatever I want for the rest of your life?"

[Taichi]
"A love slave? That is something I would wish for."

She was shocked.

[Miki]
"Forget that one. Instead, I'll have you walk on four legs like a dog and......kya!!?"

I was completely a dog from the moment she said 『a dog』.

[Taichi]
"Woof!"

[Miki]
"......wait, not that either! Uhhh, uhhh......"

She seemed to want to throw some unreasonable demand on me.
She doesn't understand.
Stuff like this only brings me joy.
Confidence returned to Miki's face.

[Miki]
"Then please take off that gas mask."

[Taichi]
"This thing?......Hmmm."

That's a problem.
My first impression is quite off-putting.
But I have no choice.
I took off the mask.

[Taichi]
"......hoi."

[Miki]
"........................"

[Taichi]
"The unfiltered air is delicious."

[Miki]
"That white hair goes down to the roots."

[Taichi]
"Yes it does."

[Miki]
"Your eyes......do you have contacts?"

[Taichi]
"Because of a physical defect, my irises are a little different from those of normal people."
[Taichi]
"......can you see them shine at the right angle?"

[Miki]
"Yeah......"

She was a little afraid.
Eyes hold emotion.
Unlike other people's, mine looked unsettling.

[Taichi]
"......it is a bit disgusting. I'm sorry."

[Miki]
"No, not really......"

[Taichi]
"I've suffered a lot because of these."

An intimate atmosphere.

[Taichi]
"But if I ate lunch with a beautiful girl, I'm sure this wound would be healed."

As I said that, I crouched down and peeked into her mini-skirt from below.

[Miki]
"Kyaaa!!?"

[Taichi]
"Damn! You're fast."

[Miki]
"Wh-what are you......doing......?"

[Taichi]
"I'm a pedantic man known as the English-Japanese dictionary of Gunjou Institute."
[Taichi]
"I'm just a little erotic so I have wounded balls."

[Miki]
"............"

At long last,

[Miki]
"Pu!"

She laughed softly.

[Miki]
"......you're a weird person."

[Taichi]
"That's an accurate assessment. Now what will you do? Panties? Or lunch?"

[Miki]
"Which means......I'm being hit on? Is that what's happening here?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

[Miki]
"That's the first time it's happened to me."

[Taichi]
"I guess it would be for you......you could say you were within my shooting range since the age of five."

[Miki]
"So you're a pervert."

[Taichi]
"That I am."
[Taichi]
"So, how about it? Lunch?"

[Miki]
"......theeen please hop that fence and buy a lunch from that delicious bakery. Then I'll have it with you."

[Taichi]
"Sounds good."

I climbed up the gate.
A few meters.
The guards immediately made noise.
But, I climb gates quickly. Landing.

[Miki]
"Ii!!?"

To Tasaki Shop.
Buy it,
Return.
A number of guards were running around the suburbs in search of me.
I broke through them and climbed over the gate once more.
The guards with inferior maneuverability had no choice but to open the gate.
With them in the corner of my eye, I searched for Miki.
......she's not here.
Did she return to the classroom?
I dashed to the first year classroom.

[Taichi]
"How's that? I went and bought it!"

[Kiri]
"This one's delicious too."

[Miki]
"......thank youuu."

[Taichi]
"Daaaaaaaaa!!!"

She'd been eating.

[Miki]
"Ah......it's the pervert-san from before."

[Kiri]
"......mu, it's that pervert..."

[Taichi]
"Hey now,"

[Miki]
"I didn't think you'd really go buy it......"

[Taichi]
"Serious jokes are my motto."

Kiri stood in front of Miki to defend her.

[Kiri]
"Are you going to flip her skirt, Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"Mu......it's that kicking girl......I only wanted to treat that girl there to lunch."

[Kiri]
"She doesn't need it anymore."

[Taichi]
"Whaaat?"

[Kiri]
"I'm looking after her. This has nothing to do with Sempai."

Ku, throwing around the name of justice to exercise your full power......are you America!?
//HELL YEA!-Spin

[Miki]
"Ah, I'm already full."

[Taichi]
"Eeeeeh!!?"

[Miki]
"......I'm sorry."

[Kiri]
"That's okay, you don't have to apologize to this person."

[Miki]
"Eeeh? But......"

[Kiri]
"He's the worst one in this school."

[Taichi]
"......hey, hey, you're overstereotyping."

I'm not particularly bad.
There are plenty of things I could do if I wanted to, but don't, and I don't try to get close to people by acting cool.
I'm always at full power.

[Taichi]
"......"

Though acting cool gets more girls.
......failure.

[Taichi]
"Then what will you do with this bread?"

[Miki]
"......shall I buy it from you?"

[Kiri]
"Uwa, you're the worst."

[Taichi]
"Ku......even though I'm the one who spoke to you first..."
[Taichi]
"Now that it's come to this, I'll eat here by force!"

I adhered to the two of them and sat down.

[Kiri]
"Wh-what are you doing!?"

[Miki]
"Kya! Wait."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, delicious, delicious. Meat is delicious right before it rots, and so is bread!"

[Kiri]
"Please go somewhere else!"

[Miki]
"Kya, wait, ahaha......that's not good."

A forced smile.
But she didn't seem to dislike it that much.

[Taichi]
"Tasty, so tasty! Ah, this part looks good!"

[Kiri]
"Heeey! That's my bentou!"

[Taichi]
"What are you-!?"

Begin argument.

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha......what is this?"

While we warred with words, Miki watched with a complex expression.
