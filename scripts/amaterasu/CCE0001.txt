Hasekura Youko returned to her room.

[Youko]
"......"

Despite returning to her territory, Youko did not loosen up.
She passed between the high-stacked towers of academic books, threw her book bag onto the bed and turned on the machines.
In her six-tatami room was a set of three PCs with LCD monitors.
They were arranged in an L-shape in the corner of the room, making it look cramped.
Though all three were fully prepared to take pictures, she hardly ever looked at, much less used, the one machine dedicated to web surfing.
//It's saying that the other two monitors are kind of useless? The comma makes this ambiguous -Neko
Because there was no one to interact with.
The built-in ceiling-high bookshelves were stuffed with all kinds of specialist books.
Not just in Japanese, but English and German, all of them in disarray.
Since she could read them, there was no point to dividing them up by language.
The shelves couldn't contain all of them, and several columns of books rose up from the floor.
They must have been left untouched recently, since all of the columns had a thin layer of dust.
Other than that, the tools and high-tech machinery stood out.
There were many things in it, but originally the room was a simple one.
A room to achieve an objective.
With only one exception, nothing that could be called 'recreation' existed.
A room filled with knowledge and means.
It was that sort of private room.
She sat in her chair and performed her daily tasks.
Checking e-mail, reading the news.
Political corruption.
Juvenile crime.
Malpractice cover-ups.
The world doesn't change.
There's a smooth increase in people committing suicide.
From the pages about those suicides, Youko casually jumped to a forum, and there her eyes stopped.
Because there was the word 'radio.'
It was an occult site.
'A ghost's voice from the radio' and 'the voice of God' and so on.
It seems to have the power to stop listeners from killing themselves.
She soon lost interest.
In order to check the trends of her investments, she pulled up several foreign sites.
This much was mechanical for her.
//Would "robotic" be better? 〜IX
//I'll go with "automatic" - Raide
//added 'for her' to make it clear that we're talking about Youko - Sheeta
Normally she'd read books or mess with the machines to fulfill some need she had.
But she had no plans today.
For the past few days, she's been adjusting her online trade of a number of stocks that showed interesting movements.
It's nice to have capital.
It'll come in handy at some point.
So will physical strength.
Today too, she completed her training.
These automatically completed tasks contributed to maintaining Youko.
She once had an objective.
To enhance herself and go out into the world.
//Since the line before this leads into it, the way it was written seemed fragmented. To is a harmless addition that prevents the awkward discrepancy. -Neko
Back when she lived in the Hasekura mansion, she'd thought that was everything.
Hard studies for that purpose.
But the object of her ambition changed at some point.
When she became half a person.
In order to protect an immature companion, she started to sharpen her skills.
And then she lost him.
All indications of him had disappeared.
What does Youko think about herself, she who continues to move around mechanically despite that?
It can't be deduced from her scarce expressions.
She turned off her computers.
The room fell dark at once.
Youko remained sitting in the chair.
Her norm had ended.
There's no longer anything to do.
She looked at the clock. It was too early to sleep.
Then,
Her eyes stopped on the sole item of recreation in her room, leaning against the wall.
A tiny, card-like radio.
//No clue what the English term is, but http://qprc.web.infoseek.co.jp/Stationery/Card/CardRadio.html has several pics of them if that helps. 〜IX
//No idea, but I'll adapt it accordingly until someone thinks of a name - Sheeta
The switch had been left in the 'on' position.
Nothing comes in on that wavelength.
Sometimes, it would catch bits of broadcasts from far-off lands.
That was it.

[Youko]
"............"

Youko sighed, and gave herself up to inactive time.
Just how much of it passed?
Youko had been lightly sleeping, but awakened in an instant.
She stared at the radio.
She thought that she'd heard heavy breathing.
Bringing with it a special nostalgic presence.

[Taichi]
"......this is......the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club......"

The shock shot through Youko.
She picked up the radio.
She couldn't do anything else.
She didn't even think of recording it.

[Taichi]
"Is anyone alive out there?"

The radio said it.
There's no doubt.

[Youko]
"......Tai......chi?"

[Taichi]
"If you are out there, please listen."

[Youko]
"Taichi."

But her voice wouldn't reach him.
She listened to the broadcast.

[Youko]
"............"

Her mouth hung open, and her face looked as if her soul had been pulled out.
Taichi's voice and breathing flowed from the radio.
The broadcast ended in an instant.
She could no longer hear his voice.
Even so, Youko kept her ear up against the radio.
She loved him.
She adored him.
He was the opposite gender.
As Taichi said, Youko's feelings might have been impure.
Youko-chan was too preferential when it came to automatically acting toward an objective.
That form of love could be seen as ugly.
But......her feelings were real.
Taichi, and no one else, threw Youko's heart into disorder.
She wasn't perfect herself.
Youko knew that.
Especially because of her childhood.
She used a boy that looked upon her with admiration and warped his mind.
On the day of the massacre, the weakness of being unable to kill a single person.
She merely held her knife and stood still among the corpses.
Other people she had no interest in. The first time she'd seen something destroyed.
An existence which merely shuddered at the ugliness of the world.
A one-sided bond that wasn't even codependency.
What should she have done?
What could she have done to be able to walk with Taichi?
Calm thought with no confusion.
Which was now quivering like a helpless child.

[Youko]
"Uuuuu......"

Sobbing.
She failed.
She failed she failed she failed.

[Taichi]
"......next week."

The broadcast ended.
At the same time, she broke down in tears.

[Youko]
"Uuuuuuuuu, uuuuuuuuuuu......"

It was a regret of extraordinary mass.
To Youko, an emotion she'd never felt in her life.
An extremely acute one.
She thought, from the bottom of her heart,
If only I'd done better--

[Tomoki]
"......Nee-san, the bath's warm now."

Shima Tomoki called to his sister, Misato, in the as yet unsettled room of their mother's house.

[Misato]
"Thank you."

The door opened partway.
In his cutoff field of vision, he could see one of Misato's knees drawn up.

[Tomoki]
"............"

That bothered him a little.
He dipped just his upper body into the room and gazed.
Until now they'd used it as a storehouse.
A dusty, empty room.
And yet just from a girl sleeping here for a few days, it smelled like this.
Tomoki found that mysterious.
Tomoki had been conscious of his sister's gender for a long time.
Him not straying from the path......was because of their common temperament, and his cowardice being a match for his urges.
Now that she's here, Tomoki's primitive emotional urges are being diluted.

[Misato]
"......what's wrong?"

Misato finally noticed.
Tomoki looked at what his sister had been watching.

[Tomoki]
"That radio......is that...?"

[Misato]
"It is."

She held it out.

[Misato]
"This is......the one from back then......"

She forced a smile.

[Tomoki]
"......"

They were once friends.
Even in Gunjou, an assembly of weird people, they were especially eccentric.
The boy made out to be the most seriously ill in Gunjou.
He was in a perpetual noisy state, always making a commotion, and playing troublesome pranks.
But Misato knew.
When she peeked at him to try and surprise him, his face was unbelievably emotionless......that sort of boy.
When he noticed Misato's existence, his eyes would half-heartedly focus and then slowly make a smile.
Yes, make one.
He consciously constructs smiles.
In essence, he didn't understand what people were.
It was quite a while after meeting him that she found out he was mimicking.
Hasekura Youko warned her just once.
I don't mind you being his friend. But, be prepared---
Was he that frightening a boy?
He certainly did have a strangely dangerous side.
Misato is still worrying about that, even now.
Unexpectedly, the radio made a noise.

[Tomoki]
"......what just-?"

[Misato]
"Shh!"

She cleared her ears.
They both shared a faint anticipation.
Filled with the same kind of tension.
Eventually, the radio began picking up small sounds.

[Taichi]
"......are there......people......listening to......this broadcast?"

Taichi's voice.

[Tomoki]
"......what...is......?"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun......"

She twisted the tuner and stabilized the sound.
She held her breath and listened.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club."
[Taichi]
"I'm here again this week."
[Taichi]
"Which week is this? Well, whatever."
[Taichi]
"It's probably the fifth or sixth."

It was a voice as unconcerned as it was dumbfounded.

[Taichi]
"As always, are you all alive out there? Are you doing well?"
[Taichi]
"I'm doing well."
[Taichi]
"......I'm coming to terms with things, and living."

[Misato]
"......"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"How to put it......I'm really living desperately."

The boy sniffled.

[Taichi]
"Recently, a lot of things have come to the surface......"
[Taichi]
"A long time ago, I came to understand a lot of things I wanted to know."
[Taichi]
"I was crying and sniveling."
[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"This is one of the things I've been thinking recently."
[Taichi]
"What if I could fall in love with someone unconditionally?"
[Taichi]
"I knew it was precious. But I didn't think it was precious."
[Taichi]
"It's like I know it logically, but my feelings can't accept it......"
[Taichi]
"I was making light of the people around me, as if they were worthless objects."
[Taichi]
"I kept my distance, alone, not conversing."
[Taichi]
"As if I had no interest."
[Taichi]
"But, the truth was different."
[Taichi]
"I just didn't know how to love people......and I wished."
[Taichi]
"Yes, certain people taught me."
[Taichi]
"To love myself, for my own sake."
[Taichi]
"That that was all I needed."
[Taichi]
"That I didn't have to think past that."
[Taichi]
"If they hadn't......I'd probably only be able to love siblings, family, and others who were naturally beside me."

Misato thought.
About falling in love.
What sort of labor has Taichi done to do that?
Tomoki thought.
To Taichi, was he an existence that could be called a friend?

[Taichi]
"When I was able to understand, everyone was gone."
[Taichi]
"That's why I'm speaking like this."
[Taichi]
"You don't have to respond. Just listening is fine."
[Taichi]
"That's why......I'll be here."
[Taichi]
"Whoever you may be on the other side,"
[Taichi]
"I will certainly be here."
[Taichi]
"See you next week."

The voice cut off like a string snapping.
The radio no longer threw out words.
The siblings' eyes met.

[Misato]
"It's him......"

Tomoki nodded.

[Tomoki]
"......Taichi."

They both stopped still in the thin darkness.
They didn't try to speak.
They could only be quiet.
Misato embraced the radio.
Though the cold plastic had no traces of the boy.
She could remember.
The touch of his skin. The scent of his hair. His breath on her ears.
There was one thing she understood from that.
Taichi's tumultuous attitude when making a commotion was his bitter, desperate cry for contact with a person.
In her vast room, Touko was sprawled out on her desk.
After returning home to her peaceful days, Touko sunk.
Alone again.
No change from before she got close to Taichi.
She originally had an inclination toward isolation.
On the other hand, after becoming close to him, she became boundlessly dependent.
She'd sell her pride, regardless of the means, if she could draw closer to him.
She had a fragile side.
Thus it was appropriate that Touko was in a girls' school.
But, some years ago, she had a confrontation with her friends and classmates.
Men and women don't ask for dependence.
What Touko's essence desired was someone subordinate to her.
Because of the wounds she inflicted, Touko was made to take the highly infamous state exam.
And then......was sent to Gunjou.
With just that truth, all her friends were wiped away.
No contact came at all.
That's what first made Touko obstinate.
When Touko moved to that mansion, for some reason, her parents' love didn't heal her.
She must have needed someone else.
Being loved by one's parents was too obvious.
Whether it was Touko, or someone else entirely.
Touko wanted some other human to see her own value.
Her attitude was for that meeting.
Because she craved it half to death, when she was fulfilled she was blown up and away.
Throwing away herself and her pride.
......not knowing that those were the most precious things.
Someone knocked on the door and spoke to her.
A maid had brought Touko's dinner.

[Touko]
"......aaah, just leave it there."

The maid said something about her being depressed all the time and hardly ever going outside.

[Touko]
"I don't feel like doing anything."

The maid wouldn't depart.
What she spoke of were worries in form alone.

[Touko]
"......I know that."

She curtly chased her out and sprawled out on the desk once again.
Her stomach bug growled.

[Touko]
"........................"

Touko's body always betrayed her.
She opened the door and pulled in the meal tray.
While having a meal with a balance of agony and appetite, the radio made a noise.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating something delicious? This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club."

She spat out something delicious.
She had a fit of coughing.

[Touko]
"!?"

She adjusted the radio's volume.

[Taichi]
"I'm living favorably. It seems a person can live just fine on his own."

[Touko]
"Taichi......?"

[Taichi]
"Are you all living?"

He suddenly said that.

[Taichi]
"......I think a lot about the heart."
[Taichi]
"The heart is a function of life."
[Taichi]
"Because if you don't stand on your own, your heart's territory won't expand."
[Taichi]
"That's why people live alone."
[Taichi]
"That's why people are born with distance between them."
[Taichi]
"It's fine to use others. Making a bond with someone so you can live to the fullest is forgivable."
[Taichi]
"But......you can't assimilate with that someone."
[Taichi]
"The same way I can't touch those of you listening to this broadcast right now."
[Taichi]
"But we don't want to believe in weak hearts."
[Taichi]
"We try to overlap them."
[Taichi]
"Being dependent, and being subordinate."
[Taichi]
"By various means, we try to lay down bypasses between ourselves and others."
[Taichi]
"But...that's impossible."
[Taichi]
"Because people are born alone, and die alone."
[Taichi]
"You might think of that distance separating us as something hopelessly wide."
[Taichi]
"You might not like it."
[Taichi]
"But, I'll be here."
[Taichi]
"Next week, I think I'll be broadcasting like this again."
[Taichi]
"And the next week, and the week after that."
[Taichi]
"Until I die."
[Taichi]
"If you'll be there, just as I'll be here......then I'm happy."
[Taichi]
"Because that's an incentive to live."
[Taichi]
"See you, next week---"

The broadcast cut off.
Touko gripped the radio hard, as if to break it.
Her face was quite tense.

[Touko]
"To live......what do you mean......to live......?"
[Touko]
"Are you saying......I'll keep living alone?"

Forever unaccepted by Taichi.
Unable to throw her feelings at him.
He says to just be there and be satisfied.
There's no way she could do that.
She knows well the weakness of her own heart.
So what should she do?
Fall in love with someone else?
Does Taichi wish for that?
Touko's heart scattered into thousands of pieces.

[Touko]
"I can't...find another person......idiot."
[Touko]
"Who would fall in love with such a strange girl......?"

There was no one who spoke to her.
No one but Taichi.

[Touko]
"I want to see you......Taichi......"

Transparent tears flowed.
She fell to her knees, and slowly folded up......until her forehead touched the floor.
The parabola her back drew began to shake slightly.
//Parabola is a plane, shouldn't it be "curve"? - Raide
She wanted to be pampered.
Because she's weak.
She wanted to touch him right.
//as in "right away" or "right now"? - Raide
Because she's immature.
She will stand alone.
How much time will be needed for her to successfully achieve that?
The current Touko couldn't even guess.
The brilliant atmosphere from the flower fields floated by the rusty old shops.
A pair of small girls.
Kiri and Miki.
They were buying food.

[Miki]
"Haaa, is this the last time I'll get to buy food with you, Kiri-chin?"

Sarcasm.
Kiri could only respond with an affable smile.

[Kiri]
"I'll be sure to come visit you, okay?"

The heat still had lasting effects.
The surfaces of the vanilla popsicles in their mouths were already melting.
//Terminology fail. I have no idea what the word is for ice cream on a stick, and "popsicle" was the closest word I knew. 〜IX
//Ice lolly? - Sheeta

[Miki]
"That's niiiice. A normal school. So niiice."

She repeated herself in a censuring tone.
Kiri could only force a smile.
Because she actually did feel sorry.
Sakura Kiri's recovery had been confirmed, and she was leaving Gunjou Institute.
She was acknowledged to be able to adapt to society.
Of course, there will be discrimination.
Since she was branded once.
But Kiri decided to go.
The bad feelings in her heart hadn't been released.
She can't accept her current self either.
And yet she says she'll go.
Miki couldn't accept that.
They'd had a fight.
Their first fight.
But Kiri will go.
The Flowers are in danger of breaking up.
Miki had been feeling dark.
Kiri had been troubled.
And then, her final day of school came about.

[Kiri]
"You could go somewhere else too, Miki, if you work for it."

[Miki]
"Hmmm, mine isn't really a mental wound so much as something I was born with, so..."
[Miki]
"There's nothing to do but hang out with you forever."

She bit her popsicle. Aggressively.
Miki's scary.
Kiri was afraid. Even though it's the end.
Miki doesn't want to leave Gunjou.
She just doesn't want Kiri to go away.
Kiri's comforting words.
Miki's true feelings.
They're subtly unable to mesh.

[Kiri]
"Miki......"

She was getting nervous.
Various excuses swirled about.
Setting off on a journey is something I need but it's not like that's more precious than my friendship with Miki not even close but it really is important to me although I want to stay a combo forever and distance doesn't matter when we have to continue onward so--
She thought of many things but without any conclusion she wanted to progress more than stand still but she didn't know how to explain that so others could understand this morass.
But, Kiri's fingers were sweating, and her ice cream was dripping on the ground like a candle.
//There's a rather bizarre metaphor being used here which I think means her ice cream is dripping. SOS. 〜IX
//Sounds like it - Sheeta
She actually felt like crying.
Seeing her partner's face, Miki smiled slightly.

[Miki]
"But, I'm happy about Kiri-chin's new start."

[Kiri]
"!!"

Miki was being so hospitable, Kiri got upset.
She had to say something clever.
But her mind was blank.
She couldn't find any dramatic words.
Finally, she wrung out a feeling.

[Kiri]
"......we'll always be a combo."

Those words took all she had.

[Kiri]
"Even if we're apart."

[Miki]
"......yes, I know."

She pointed to Kiri's ice cream with her jaw.
That moment, the melted ice cream came off the stick and fell to the ground with a splat.

[Miki]
"......"

[Kiri]
"......"

A relaxed atmosphere.
Then,

[Taichi]
"......Gunjou......Broadcasting Club......"

It was from the radio in Miki's chest pocket.
She hurriedly took it out.
The rumored radio program was here.
Miki attached earphones and passed one end to Kiri.

[Kiri]
"This is......?"

[Miki]
"Yes, it's Sempai."

The mysterious radio broadcast.
People had started talking about it on the internet, and it was rushing around Japan while creating various town legends.

[Taichi]
"I'd like to talk about the past today."

Kurosu Taichi.

[Taichi]
"I might have talked about it a long time ago, though I don't remember......"

There's no doubt.
He disappeared, leaving only strange memories in the Broadcasting Club members' hearts.

[Taichi]
"But I'm sure I've told someone about this before."

He's not missing or disappeared.

[Taichi]
"A long time ago, I committed a sin---"

By himself, with no one knowing the truth.
A single boy who was like an illusion.

[Kiri]
"He's alive......and......he's still around somewhere? But how?"

[Miki]
"He's......broadcasting."

A ghost broadcast.
This was actually the first time they'd heard one.

[Taichi]
"I made a friend of mine die......"

Taichi told a story.
It was about a friend of his.
A boy that Taichi led to his death.

[Kiri]
"......"

[Miki]
"......"

Neither of them moved a muscle until the broadcast ended.
At long last static wiped out the boy's voice.
They both sighed, as if released from a curse.

[Kiri]
"......was that...?"

[Miki]
"Yes......there's no doubt. It's......our club."

[Kiri]
"Umm......in that empty town?"

[Miki]
"Probably......"

[Kiri]
"Alone?"

[Miki]
"Probably......right?"

[Kiri]
"Is that......even possible?"

[Miki]
"I think...Sempai wished for it. To be alone."

[Kiri]
"That's why I just said-! That's why......"

[Miki]
"Only his voice reaches us......somehow...that's just like Sempai, right?"

The other world, and this world.
Whatever Taichi did, these two came back to this one.
And he's conducting club activities by himself.

[Kiri]
"......yes."

[Miki]
"It's lonely."

[Kiri]
"Yes. And...sad."

[Miki]
"I want to see him."

[Kiri]
"So do I......"

The day of parting for two close friends.
They both ended up confronting a parting of the past.

[Taichi]
"And so, see you next week---"

The broadcast wrapped up with those words.

[Sakuraba]
"......hoo."

A path between mountains.
Sakuraba had stopped his bike to take a rest, and was smiling softly.

[Sakuraba]
"It's been a long time, friend."

There was no way his words would be heard.
And yet Sakuraba voiced them.
He does what he wants to do as long as it doesn't cause problems, and he hangs out with whoever he likes.
He'd thought Taichi was gone.
But today, he heard his voice.
'So he's still alive somewhere,' Sakuraba thought.
That was enough to fill his heart and make him happy.

[Taichi]
"Guu..."
[Taichi]
"Guusuu..."
[Taichi]
"Munya-munya......"

[Misato]
(Peke-kun is sleeping)
//I decided not to have any periods in this segment, as there were none in Japanese. You may disagree. 〜IX

[Sakuraba]
(Yes he is)

[Miki]
(His sleeping face is cute)

[Kiri]
(When he's sleeping......that is)

[Touko]
(Should we wake him up, as punishment?)

[Tomoki]
(Do we really have the right to do that......after what he did for us)

[Touko]
(That really surprised me......seriously)

[Miki]
(Cov-ered-in-blood)

[Kiri]
(Splatter)

[Sakuraba]
(Blood splatter)

[Tomoki]
(......isn't that true?)

[Touko]
(I'd like to bring Taichi back to our side)

[Misato]
(Does that mean......killing him?)

[Youko]
(......don't)

[Touko]
(Hasekura-sempai's overprotection has begun)

[Youko]
(Don't do what you mustn't do)

[Touko]
(Uuu)

[Youko]
(Uuu)

[Miki]
(Battle begin)

[Misato]
(Well, well, isn't this all right?)

[Youko]
(Leave him alone, you'll wake him.....)

[Kiri]
(Favoritism......there's favoritism)

[Miki]
(Because I'm Kiri-chin's favorite)

[Touko]
(Will the lesbian combo over there please keep it in moderation?)

[Miki]
(Gyaaa)

[Tomoki]
(Aren't you just making noise.....?)

[Sakuraba]
(But he seems fine)

[Misato]
(......Peke-kun is fast asleep, isn't he?)

[Kiri]
(I wonder if he's having a dream of some kind)

[Miki]
(He's smiling)

[Touko]
(Yeah, he seems to be having fun......isn't that good, Hasekura-sempai?)

[Youko]
(......yes.....)

[Misato]
(I wanted to say goodbye, but......we probably can't contact him)

[Sakuraba]
(Farewell)

[Tomoki]
(Bye-bye)

[Touko]
(Impatient boys! Geez......bye, Taichi)

[Misato]
(Take care)

[Miki]
(Goodbye)

[Kiri]
(This is goodbye)

[Youko]
(......*sob*)

[Misato]
(P-please don't cry!)

[Sakuraba]
(Hope it goes well)

[Touko]
(Hope what goes well!?)

[Miki]
(It does seem like he'll do well)

[Kiri]
(......forced)

[Taichi]
"......nn?"

I got up.
I felt a strange presence, but...

[Taichi]
"I thought......I heard......everyone......"

There was no presence on the roof.
All was silent.
Am I hearing voices?
It was more like I felt them than heard them.

[Taichi]
"Nnn???"

I've overslept.

[Taichi]
"Whatever."

I went back to sleep.

[Taichi]
"Suu..."
[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"............"
[Taichi]
"........................"
[Taichi]
"......haha."
[Taichi]
"What are......you all doing......"
[Taichi]
"............I'm......tired......"
[Taichi]
"I'll do it later......"
[Taichi]
"........................after I......"
[Taichi]
"........................................."
[Taichi]
