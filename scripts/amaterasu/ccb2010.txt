A fun walk to school.
And yet,
Touko was sullen the whole way there.

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"......hmph."

She'd put up a barrier.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

She'd been this way all morning.
I'd been unconscious all last night, so I have no idea what it might be about.
The only thing I could come up with was that, maybe while I was unconscious, I did something while sleepwalking......

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

It was possible.
When I woke up this morning, she was already at the pinnacle of ill humor.

[Taichi]
"Heeey."

[Touko]
"......"

It's hopeless.
Touko rushed ahead of me.
I closed in on her.
And lined up next to her.
The proud and haughty Touko didn't look at me at all.
This is beautiful and all, but with the cause unclear, it's just...
I extended one hand and tried gripping her breast.

[Touko]
"Ii!?"

[Taichi]
"You don't have any boobs at all!"

[Touko]
"Sileeeeence!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ojou-samaaaaaa!!!"

As I rotated comfortably I traced out a skyline in the air then the moment a part of my head made contact with the ground it abruptly hit the brakes and changed me to a single-rim wheel shape rolling at high speed and outrunning the rotation of the Earth itself...
...only to plunge into the nearest grove of trees with the vigor of a boomerang.

[Taichi]
"The Harakiri Fist......an invincible battle technique......"

The (late) grandfather who taught Touko iai and various other skills had also been called an invincible demon.
He'd been famous in the martial arts world, and on the net there was a video of him killing a bull barehanded.

[Touko]
......*growlll*

And this was his granddaughter.
There's no way she'd have grown up weak.

[Taichi]
"Miss Touko, what are you so angry about?"

[Touko]
"......hmph, idiot!"

Ah, that feels right.
But I still don't know the reason behind her rage.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara-san, I don't think it's good to hit people just because of your own biology, really."

[Touko]
"Don't say such squalid things in that boyish tone of voice!!!"
[Touko]
"And it's not biology!"

[Taichi]
"Yes, based on my data, Touko's menstruation period should occur one week hence---"

Gain!

[Taichi]
"......guu."

I was punched.

[Touko]
"Why do you know it that well!? Just die!"

[Taichi]
"I think you're going to kill me before I even get the chance to die......"

[Touko]
"I don't care!"

You don't care......?

[Taichi]
"Feeling down after the first day of living together with a man is something even I can't understand."

Touko's countenance was rapidly repainted in scarlet.
Not from shame, but from rage.

[Touko]
"Why don't you ask your own heart!?"

*shuffle* *shuffle* *shuffle*
She walked on ahead.
My own heart......
As a guy, mine's completely flat.
......that's not it.
(TL Note: One of the Japanese words for "heart" can also mean "chest" or "breasts.")
I asked my own heart:
Touko was in a good mood until... when?
She was definitely smiling when she was moving to my place yesterday. The whole time.
Then, I'm pretty sure a part of my soul was burned alive at the stake---
Ugh...
I felt dizzy.
I still couldn't believe it.
Is this something like the sadness of losing one's child?
I can't rely on academic books any longer.
A number of fictionally fertilized idols passed through my mind.

[Taichi]
"Farewell......"

That aside, let's think about Touko.
Last night I'm pretty sure I received some sort of shock and fell unconscious.
I didn't get dinner.
Nor did I get any breakfast.
By the way, I'm very hungry.
*ding!*

[Taichi]
"Is that it...?"

I knew the reason behind her ill humor.
It'll be simple to nurse it back to health.
Now that I knew what it was, I had the freedom to fully enjoy her rough mood.

[Taichi]
"♪♪"

I followed the road, humming.
The gate had been left open.
As if waiting to let me inside.
I used to think of this place as a prison.
But right now, it was a reassuring place, like a womb.
There aren't any people.
None, nowhere.
Only at school, only at Gunjou Institute, could we naturally gather together and see one another.
We were pulled in and made to carry on the past.
Actually, this annihilation of humanity is quite harsh.
I think it was the final straw for most humans.
It was good news for me, but for them it was a disheartening and lax death.
And Touko had no choice but to come to my house.
It's ironic.
I went to the cafeteria.
I sensed a presence nearby.

[Taichi]
"What guy?"

No answer.
I approached the one making faint noises.

[Sakuraba]
"......!!"

It was Sakuraba.
He was sitting down on the cold floor, and his shoulders were quivering.
He seemed to be devouring something......
With all his heart.

[Taichi]
"?"

I stood behind him.

[Taichi]
"Raba?"

I called his name.

[Sakuraba]
"......Taichiiii."

[Taichi]
"Gyoeeeee!!!"

I let loose a kick for some reason.
A front kick.
My toes turned to javelins as they slammed into his face.

[Sakuraba]
"......"

Sakuraba collapsed silently.
He got back up right away. No damage.

[Sakuraba]
"What are you doing?"

He said coolly.

[Taichi]
"I did that because your face was weird."

[Sakuraba]
"......hu, such infringement."

I'm absolutely convinced he used the wrong kanji there.
After all, he's an idiot.
(TL Note: "Infringement" and "unexpected" are homonyms.)

[Taichi]
"Were you eating?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, as you can see."

[Taichi]
"......curry bread?"

Sakuraba's favorite food.
Probably cafeteria leftovers.

[Sakuraba]
"For some reason they were one case overstocked."
[Sakuraba]
"No one's eating it, so I took it."

[Taichi]
"No one's eating it because it's horrible."

[Sakuraba]
"Hu."

[Taichi]
"Stop that 'hu' laugh. It's annoying."

[Sakuraba]
"It'll spoil otherwise."

He's not listening at all.
In Sakuraba's vicinity, innumerable wrappers had been scattered about.

[Sakuraba]
"Would you like some?"

[Taichi]
"No."

[Sakuraba]
"I see."
[Sakuraba]
"I will definitely not push my justice onto yours."

[Taichi]
"Thank you."

Sakuraba has no concern whatsoever for the coherence of a conversation.

[Sakuraba]
"You're welcome."

He smiled.
He bit into more curry bread.

[Taichi]
"You've eaten this much already......?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yes, it might be the last curry bread in my life."

Sakuraba ate earnestly.
You may as well call it a fight with the curry bread.
However,
The cafeteria was a blind spot.

[Taichi]
"......are there no other kinds of bread?"

[Sakuraba]
"There were."

[Taichi]
"Past tense I see."

So he's eaten them all.

[Sakuraba]
"Any bread other than curry bread is unnecessary, so I threw it away."

I kicked him.
With intent to kill.

[Sakuraba]
"......hu!"

I cut off his medulla oblongata. Sakuraba fell down like a pile of sticks.

[Taichi]
"......why are you always like that?"

[Sakuraba]
"You're welcome."

He said, standing up calmly.

[Taichi]
"Are you mad!?"
[Taichi]
"Where'd you throw them out to!?"

[Sakuraba]
"I forgot."

A straight punch to the face.

[Taichi]
"......having a friend like you here in this crisis situation truly strengthens my heart."

[Sakuraba]
"Don't mention it."

Criminal cluelessness.
Now I'm the pitiful one.

[Taichi]
"Is there anything left at all!?"

I inspected the stacked cases.

[Taichi]
"There's something."

Croquette bread.
Thanks to Sakuraba's carelessness, there were tons of it left.

[Taichi]
"There's plenty here."

[Sakuraba]
"That stuff is there too."

[Taichi]
"I'll be taking all of this."

[Sakuraba]
"Do as you like."

I easily obtained food.
Sure enough, Touko was right there.

[Taichi]
"You got here fast."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"And yet you're in casual wear again?"
[Taichi]
"I'm impressed you can wear something so warm."

Ignore.

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey."

I shrugged my shoulders and sat down in my seat......right next to Touko's.
I stared at her profile.
She appeared to take no notice of me, but I knew she was paying attention to me.

[Taichi]
"Sorry about last night."
[Taichi]
"I asked my heart like you said."
[Taichi]
"I was bad."
[Taichi]
"But I'm fine now. You and I are happy now."

Touko budged.
She turned to me.

[Touko]
"......Taichi's always like that."
[Touko]
"As if you can't even see me."
[Touko]
"Always running off......acting on your own."

[Taichi]
"You're right. I'm reflecting on that."

[Touko]
"I just want you to care about me a little more."

[Taichi]
"I thought you'd say that......so I came prepared."

[Touko]
"Prepared?"

Croquette bread landed on the top of Touko's desk.

[Taichi]
"Now, satisfy your hunger!"

[Touko]
"That's not it!!"

*growlll*...
However, Touko's stomach growled.

[Touko]
"Hafu!!?"

[Taichi]
"Your stomach bug."

[Touko]
"Th-this is different!"

*growl* *growlll*...
Her stomach bug.

[Taichi]
"Your stomach bug again."

[Touko]
"I'm telling you this is a different issue!"

[Taichi]
"There's no point in hiding it. I can talk to stomach bugs, you know?"

[Touko]
"............uh, what?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, you're hungry."
[Taichi]
"And so am I, by the way."
[Taichi]
"So, our first period class will be croquette bread."

I tore open a package and dug into the first one.
Thankfully, they hadn't spoiled.

[Taichi]
"And this will also be our time to make up."
[Taichi]
"......I guess that'd be ethics."

Touko was amazed.
But,

[Touko]
"......hu!"

She started laughing.

[Touko]
"It's been a few days since I heard the word 'class.'"

[Taichi]
"Weren't you coming every day? Oh, I thought you were having classes by yourself here."

[Touko]
"......maybe I was."

She grabbed some bread.

[Touko]
"I really looked forward to last night's dinner."

[Taichi]
"Ah, in order to use me as a convenient cook......"

[Touko]
"Th-that's not it!"
[Touko]
"......I thought we could eat together."

[Taichi]
"We're eating now."

[Touko]
"......fine, fine. Those who don't understand will never understand."

[Taichi]
"?"

[Touko]
"I'm eating this!"

She ate while raging.

[Touko]
"......delicious."

[Taichi]
"On an empty stomach, everything's delicious."

[Touko]
"......it's not just that..."

A flirtatious glance.

[Taichi]
"What else is there?"

[Touko]
"Well......the atmosphere and stuff are important."

[Taichi]
"That's true, not that I really understand it."

[Touko]
"That's why, ummm......you know, if you feel really sad you can't even taste the food."

[Taichi]
"This is really delicious. The sauce is rich."

I said while chewing it.

[Touko]
"What I'm trying to say is...isn't it different when you eat with different people?"

[Taichi]
"Izzzz it?"

[Touko]
"Ku!......"
[Touko]
"If I disappeared......wouldn't Taichi be lonely......?"

[Taichi]
"Eh? You don't want any more bread? I'm going to take it all, you know?"

[Touko]
"Why can't you understand that I'm trying to imply it's more delicious to eat with the person you love---!!?"

[Taichi]
"I'm already getting hit----!!"

[Touko]
"......dimwit."

[Taichi]
"A woman's heart is like English. I don't get it at all."

[Touko]
"Haaaah, not one of the dreams a girls' school graduate has can be granted."

[Taichi]
"Boys' dreams don't get granted either."

[Touko]
"Like what?"

[Taichi]
"......like an event where all the participants are pretty lesbian girls making vows of sisterhood."

[Touko]
"Gross."

[Taichi]
"Don't call it gross! It's a dream!"

[Touko]
"Do boys really have such warped delusions?"

[Taichi]
"If that's warped, then the school bloomer wearers are aliens on Alpha Centauri."

[Touko]
"School bloomers?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

Though she probably can't help it.

[Taichi]
"These days, they can no longer be found."

[Touko]
"?"

She tilted her head.

[Taichi]
"So, what're your dreams?"

I asked her while my cheeks were stuffed full of bread, like a squirrel.

[Touko]
"......stop it, don't show me that face."

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

[Touko]
"I don't want to see a pre-hibernation Taichi."

[Taichi]
"......even if I look like a squirrel before hibernation, I'm still the same old Taichi."
[Taichi]
"So the reason for Ojou-sama's bad mood is going to remain a mystery after all?"

[Touko]
"........................"

Oh?
She blushed.

[Touko]
......*sob*

Uwa...
She's crying.
I'm weak against a maiden's tears.

[Taichi]
"Aaaah, crying won't......what should I...?"

Befuddlement...

[Touko]
"......not happy..."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Touko]
"Not happy...not happy..."

Touko-ojou-sama's selfish phase has begun again.

[Taichi]
"Who isn't happy about what? If I can do something about it, I will..."

Touko raised her head with a glint in her eye.

[Touko]
"Taichi isn't happy about living with me."

A petite description trick!!?
She was talking about me!?

[Taichi]
"Haaaan?"

[Touko]
"......ye...yesterday we didn't do anything......"

[Taichi]
"Didn't someone make me pass out?"
[Taichi]
"Nnn, we didn't do anything? That's why you're feeling bad?"

Eh? That's......

[Touko]
"What!?"

[Taichi]
"Did you want to have sex?"

I poked my thumbs up out of my fists (both of them).

[Touko]
"........................"

[Taichi]
"........................"

Touko thrashed me in silence. I took it quietly.
It was a beautiful status quo.
And there was also bread.

[Touko]
......*sob*

She was moved to tears.

[Taichi]
"............"

She really is innocent.
Even though the world's been destroyed, she's having a casual love affair.
It's true......Touko has nowhere else to run.
I'm the one who did that to her.
My jests changed that.
Retribution......?
Reproach, perhaps?
Either way, I had a duty to be with her to the end.

[Taichi]
"Ooookaaay!!"

Touko flinched.

[Touko]
"......what?"

[Taichi]
"I've decided. I'll become Touko's prince."

[Touko]
".............................................eh?"

She was totally hooked.

[Taichi]
"Don't worry. I know that in the depths of your subconscious, you desire a prince."
[Taichi]
"Come to me."

Touko scowled at me with lethargic eyes.

[Taichi]
"Then......shall we have sex?"

Her lethargic eyes turned to dots.

[Touko]
"Ho-eh!!?"

[Taichi]
"Now, strip."

[Touko]
"Wh-wh-wh-wh-?"

Her eyes went monochromatic.
Okay, now I'll use one of Touko's favorite catch phrases here.

[Taichi]
"Miss Touko, QI (want love) from you."

Now it's a certainty.
(TL Note: This penultimately bad English is based on the fact that "QI" sounds like "kyuuai," which he's pretending is a real word by assigning kanji to it.)

[Touko]
"Re-re-re......you really want to!?"

[Taichi]
"Very much so."

[Touko]
"............"

She became ashamed.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong? Now that your stomach's full, let's satiate your lust."

I took her hand.

[Touko]
"I don't want to fulfill the three greatest wants in a specific order-----!!!"

[Taichi]
"Okay, then I'll perform appropriate foreplay to heighten the mood."

[Touko]
"I don't want that either!!"

[Taichi]
"You'd prefer I do it by force?"

My eyes sparkled.
I placed a hand on her clothes.

[Taichi]
"Now, now, now..."

I tried to strip her.
Her shoulders became exposed.

[Touko]
"Ummm, well, school, it's because we're at school, ah, aaaaah???"

She's confused.
Pitifully so.

[Taichi]
"No need to worry. Now, strip more. Show me your modest breasts and pink beech-kun."

[Touko]
"No, nooooooooooooooo!!!!!"
(TL Note: Taichi appears to be referencing the edible leaves and seeds of the Japanese beech tree.)

*gong!*

[Taichi]
"Kyuu..."

I lost consciousness.
When I woke up, Touko wasn't there.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

It's not like it'd be her first.
......faking love is hard.
I need to go to the bathroom.
