Kiri was in the hallway.
That's also the same as usual.
It just doesn't happen with a high probability.

[Taichi]
"Kiriii."

[Kiri]
"Mu!"

I was glared at.

[Taichi]
"Mu!"

I glared.
*bam* *bam* *bam* *bam* *bam* *bam* *bam* *bam!!!* (Psychological Effect)
My nipple was getting itchy, but I bore with it.

[Miki]
"Fuiii, I feel refreshed."

At long last Miki came out of the bathroom.

[Miki]
"Nyooooo!!?"

An appropriate scream given that her conduct only a moment earlier had just hit my ears.
Then, I stepped forward.

[Taichi]
"Did you think I came here for no reason?"

And, I put my hand in my chest pocket.
There, a secret weapon......obviously didn't exist, this was just a bluff.
Instead I scratched my nipple.
I eliminated the threat and my nipple itch. Two birds with one stone.
Kiri moved her hand behind her back,
Pulled out a crossbow, and pointed it forward.

[Taichi]
"Uwaaaaa."

I was appropriately surprised.
But I didn't become stressed......
Aside from the fact that getting shot and dying is no problem...
Hmmm.
Isn't there this decision as well?
