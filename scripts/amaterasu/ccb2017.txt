[Taichi]
"Now then, why don't we go to bed?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

[Taichi]
"Nnn, for an ojou-sama, Touko, you're weak at chess."

I stretched.

[Touko]
"......woof."

10 Wins, 0 Losses.
When we came back from the beach, Touko had withered for some reason, so I challenged her to a game in order to take her mind off of whatever it was.

[Taichi]
"Do you need a snack?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

She shook her head.

[Taichi]
"Then let's sleep."
[Taichi]
"Come here now."

I called softly to her, and her face turned red.

[Touko]
"......wooof."

She got up on the bed.
I hugged her.

[Taichi]
"Nnn."

I repeatedly kissed her neck.

[Touko]
"......wofu!......nn!......woof!"

[Taichi]
"By the way..."

[Touko]
"......woof?"

[Taichi]
"Why are you saying 'woof?'"

[Touko]
"Didn't you demand that I'd talk like a dog as punishment for losing in chess?!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, did I do that?"

I'd forgotten.

[Taichi]
"Then keep talking like a dog."

[Touko]
"......umm......before that, I have just one question......how long do I have to keep it up?"

[Taichi]
"Until Touko wins a chess game......"

[Touko]
"Then I'd die a dog!"

She covered her face.

[Taichi]
"Then, I'll spend the next hour doing perverted things, and if Touko doesn't cum once, I'll forgive her."

[Touko]
"......"
[Touko]
"Pervert."
[Touko]
"Pervert. Pervert."

[Taichi]
"Uhi."

[Touko]
"Pervert. Pervert. Pervert!"

[Taichi]
"That's correct, Ojou-sama."

[Touko]
"......one hour?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

I propped up my jaw with one hand and examined her.
When having sex, we usually touch each other softly for around an hour.
There's no need to rush these things, and there's no lack of time, so it's only natural.
That was all Touko needed to know to make her decision.

[Touko]
"Okay then."
[Touko]
"I think that'll be easy."
//She's insulting his capabilities as a man, here. Go Touko, you go girl. - pondrthis

Those words that can't be said.
She'd lit a fire.

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"
[Taichi]
"Now, in this house the guests sleep on the floor."

[Touko]
"......uuuu, I can't sleep on the hard floor......cheapskate."

[Taichi]
"When a girl lies down, I'll have to keep doing perverted things to them all night."

[Touko]
"You have to......?"

[Taichi]
"If you can't sleep, just use one of the beds in the other rooms."

[Touko]
"......uuu."

She was worrying.
Her eyes felt pained.
My heart was also feeling pain.

[Taichi]
"Do you...have a complaint?"

[Touko]
"It's okay......I'll sleep here."

Damn, she's cute.
She doesn't want to sleep away from me.
But I can't fall for it.
Touko's getting more and more hopeless. As if she's melting away.
Just like a piece of candy.
That's why I'll take my time and lick her very slowly.
......so she doesn't disappear.

[Touko]
"......Taichi, you're pretty strict."

Quite so.

[Taichi]
"Good night."

[Touko]
"The floor's hard......it hurts......*sneeze*"

She lay down inside a futon on the floor.
I lay down too.
I got the sense that the atmosphere had quieted down in an instant.
The starlight through the windows became innumerable columns, forming a comb.
It was like another world.

[Touko]
"Hey......Taichi......"

She spoke behind me.

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Touko]
"Do you think we can be together forever......?"

[Taichi]
"Even if I said no, you'd cling to me anyway."

[Touko]
"......huhu, then maybe it's fine."

[Taichi]
"Why are you asking that?"

[Touko]
"But, people have disappeared. Someday, won't we......?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"If we're going to disappear, I'd at least like it to be......together......"

Touko fell asleep.
Together...huh...
I hadn't thought about it too deeply.
About the fact that humanity was gone.
Why did they disappear?
In what way did they disappear?
There was nothing to base an explanation on.
Even Youko-chan isn't coming to say anything. She mustn't know anything about it herself.
Even if she was here, we wouldn't be able to theorize the cause.
I looked out the window, at the night sky.
That's why there's nothing for us eight to do but to keep living on.
While hurting and loving one another.
