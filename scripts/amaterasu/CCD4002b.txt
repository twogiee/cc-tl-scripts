[Taichi]
"Aaah, wait, wait."

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Since we're here, come play with me."

Miki stopped.
As I thought, her lack of experience points made her reactions dull.

[Miki]
"......just the two of us?"

[Taichi]
"How inelegant. I'm inviting you on a date."

[Miki]
"Date..."

She meaninglessly repeated my words.

[Taichi]
"Third wheels aren't needed on a date. We can just occlude ourselves in our own little world."

[Miki]
"I see......"

It seems like I've pressured her into agreeing.

[Taichi]
"I won't take up too much of your time."
[Taichi]
"Actually, even Kiri has times when she wants to be left alone, right?"

[Miki]
"......yes, so..."

[Taichi]
"Okay, then let's go toward the housing complex without returning to school."

[Miki]
"......ah, but I'd like to see how she's doing......"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

[Miki]
"Gyanyaaa."

I pulled her along.
The current Miki probably wouldn't recover if she sunk even once.
Fragile.
But that's normal.
It means she's a normal girl.
She's uneasy without Kiri.
I can just make her hesitate for a week.
She'll return to her normal life.
But, it's meaningless to just send her back.
There's a need for me to obtain some things from her.
