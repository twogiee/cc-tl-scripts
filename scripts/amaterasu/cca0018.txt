[Tomoki]
"Taichiii."

As I walked down the hallway, my name was called.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're still here?"

[Tomoki]
"Same to you."

Tomoki's face was like a noh mask.
We left a subtle distance between us.
(TL Note: Noh is one of the major forms of classical Japanese stage drama.)

[Taichi]
"I was at club."
[Taichi]
"I've been showing up there lately."

[Tomoki]
"......why this again?"

[Taichi]
"Well, isn't it nice to have goals?"

[Tomoki]
"By 'club,' you meant 'that' nonsense?"

The opening of the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club channel.

[Taichi]
"That's not nonsense, probably."

[Tomoki]
"If Taichi's doing such a thing......well, there must be some kind of reason."
[Tomoki]
"Who else is participating?"

[Taichi]
"The prez."

[Tomoki]
"......that's it?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Tomoki]
"That's not a club......"

[Taichi]
"We call it a club to pleasure ourselves."

[Tomoki]
"......lately, I'd known she'd been pushing a lot of things forward...so that was for the club..."

I shrugged my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Same goes for you. What're you doing now?"

[Tomoki]
"A club."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."
[Taichi]
"......eh? I don't get you."

[Tomoki]
"A real club."
[Tomoki]
"Come participate if you're free."

[Taichi]
"That'd be nice, but......"

[Tomoki]
"......you'll be betrayed."

He spat out.

[Taichi]
"By who?"

[Tomoki]
"By the prez."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Tomoki]
"That's why it's best not to get too close to her."

Tomoki turned his back to me and walked away.
He was acting weird.
But why?
On the way home,
The once-quiet cicadas slowly but steadily began to chirp once more.

[Shinkawa]
"Heya there."

[Taichi]
"Nnn? ......oooh, Tanizaki!"

[Shinkawa]
"Kounosu! How've you been?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah...I, Kounosu Taichi, have the sole merit of feeling great even if my license gets suspended."

[Shinkawa]
"But can't you say the same about me, Tanizaki Yutaka?"

[Taichi]
"It's been a few days, Tanizaki."

[Shinkawa]
"Yes it has, Kounosu."

[Taichi]
"When will Tanizaki start going to school?"

[Shinkawa]
"They say it'll start tomorrow, Kounosu."

He waved the A4 envelope in his hand.
Must be full of school documents.

[Taichi]
"Oh, transfer into our class, Tanizaki."

[Shinkawa]
"Kounosu, don't ask the impossible. You know it's not my decision."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."

[Shinkawa]
"Wahaha."

We both laughed deeply.

[Taichi]
"But even so, Tanizaki---"

[Shinkawa]
"......okay, I give! My name is Shinkawa Yutaka. My apologies Kurosu-san."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, you're going to stop that?"

[Shinkawa]
"It seemed like it'd keep going forever."

[Taichi]
"Going home already?"

[Shinkawa]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"Why not come by my place?"

[Shinkawa]
"Is it close by?"

[Taichi]
"Ten minutes from here I'd guess."

[Shinkawa]
"Don't you live in a nice place. Sorry though, next time."
[Shinkawa]
"My niece...she's going to Gunjou after all, so I need to tell her a lot about it."

My ears,
Such information,
It won't slip by me (grab).

[Shinkawa]
"What's that thumbs-up about?"

[Taichi]
"Hey, you, the guy over there."

[Shinkawa]
"Wh-what is it?"

[Taichi]
"I'm very sorry, but I heard you had a niece."

[Shinkawa]
"That is what I just said."

[Taichi]
"Her age?"

[Shinkawa]
"One below mine."

[Taichi]
"Got a picture?"

[Shinkawa]
"......Kurosu?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, never mind, it's nothing. Please forget it."
[Taichi]
"However, if that one point was different, wouldn't she be cute?"

[Shinkawa]
"Mmmm, well, her looks are..."

[Taichi]
"Aren't looks everything?"

My voice naturally lowered.
A certain kind of jealousy and envy......and malice.

[Shinkawa]
"Ha?"

[Taichi]
"No, don't worry about it."

[Shinkawa]
"......still, she's kinda boyish."
[Shinkawa]
"I should tell you, I have no such emotions for her. Being looked at with those eyes is just kinda disgusting."

[Taichi]
"Liessss!!"

[Shinkawa]
"Wa! What just happened?"

[Taichi]
"That's a lie!! You're a liar! You've got a cute younger relative. There's no way you wouldn't be conscious of it! Haven't you read a single volume of French Study!? It's impossible! Incomprehensible! Thus it has been proven that you are a liar!"

[Shinkawa]
"Kurosu......I do pity you, but I'm being serious."

[Taichi]
"No! I don't want to hear it!"

[Shinkawa]
"She's really more like a little sister, since we live together."

Cohabitation!!?
The same bed!!?
The warmth of the other gender!!?!?

[Taichi]
"...hey, the will of some extraordinary being is intervening in that location."

[Shinkawa]
"......you're making yet another convenient misinterpretation."
[Shinkawa]
"I was taken in by her household."
[Shinkawa]
"That's why we're like siblings."
[Shinkawa]
"So I came here and moved in together with them. My legs might be like this, but she's also a little..."

[Taichi]
"Aaah......"

So that's what it was.
I agreed at once.
So now they go to Gunjou...

[Taichi]
"Oh, in that case, didn't you transfer here in order to hang out with your niece-chan?"

[Shinkawa]
"I guess so. Well, I'm handicapped too."
[Shinkawa]
"And don't call her 'niece-chan'......"

[Taichi]
"You're a caring onii-chan."

[Shinkawa]
"Umm, we seem to have gotten caught up in discussing my niece..."

[Taichi]
"That's the nature of concentrated envy."

[Shinkawa]
"Is that so? We've been living together forever, so I've seen her under various biological effects, and then there's that..."

[Taichi]
"That?"

[Shinkawa]
"Her appearance is pretty good, but she's got this bad habit of eating with her mouth open, so it's hard to think of her as something beautiful, you know?"
[Shinkawa]
"You eat what you eat, and expel what---"

[Taichi]
"Ah, you can stop there. My dreams are precious."

[Shinkawa]
"......your dreams?"

[Taichi]
"I'd love to change places with you and get all affectionate with your niece-chan."

[Shinkawa]
"Uwaa, don't make me imagine that; it's disgusting."

[Taichi]
"It'll never be reality......"

This person really finds it disgusting.
Long live erotic novels.

[Taichi]
"Then come visit me sometime."

[Shinkawa]
"Oooh, I'll introduce you to her."

[Taichi]
"Seriously?"

I was fluttering.

[Shinkawa]
"......it's no big deal, but......don't get your hopes up, okay?"

It's no big deal.
It will later become clear that the eyes of the guy who said that were knotholes on par with the Taepodong.
