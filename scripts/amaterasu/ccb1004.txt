The construction of the antenna seems to be progressing slowly, but steadily.

[Taichi]
"Sempai?"

[Misato]
"......nnah, nnnaah?"

[Taichi]
"What's the meaning of this? You sleeping for so long..."

[Misato]
"No, I wasn't sleeping."

She staggered to her feet.

[Misato]
"Anyway, good morning."

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Sempai."
[Taichi]
"Won't you die from the heat if you sleep here in the middle of the day?"

[Misato]
"Ah, right, that's true. I'll be more careful."

Sempai wiped her glasses with the hem of her skirt.
......I can see her panties.
This girl's still half-asleep.
Could she possibly have stayed here all night?
I didn't have the courage to ask.
Plump thighs.
Come to think of it, in Japan of late,
There are loliskis rushing for their lolis against all the trends and regulations of society.
A certain critical part of the media aside, it'd be unforgivable were there not lolis.
And I, Kurosu Taichi, have one thing to say to that world!
That is a sickness!
Young girls are cute too, but these thighs and glimpses of light blue cloth are also great things.

[Misato]
"Nyamu......"

She held back a yawn while wiping her glasses.
Honest.
This is Sempai's honest face.
Her skirt fell back into place.
Sempai put her glasses back on.

[Misato]
"I'm sleepy......"

[Taichi]
"I bet you are."

[Misato]
"Uhhh, what were you here for?"

[Taichi]
"Work, please."

[Misato]
"Why are you talking with your back to me?"

[Taichi]
"I can only say that it is due to a solid, three-dimensional problem."

[Misato]
"Philosophical...that's very philosophical."

Though it's actually a very vulgar and fleshy reason.

[Taichi]
"I'll be participating in the club, so can I have some work, please?"

[Misato]
"Aaannn......"

Sempai muttered to herself.
I'm listening to her, but I can't make out much.
I caught these fragments:

[Misato]
『I was an idiot for worrying.』
[Misato]
『It's not like I've been running.』
[Misato]
『...like a dog...』
[Misato]
『...taking a liking...』
[Misato]
『...not a nuisance or anything...』
[Misato]
『...as someone to hang out with...』
[Misato]
『I'm the older one after all.』
[Misato]
『Hic!』

That last one's a hiccup.
Isn't there something weird about her?
Though she's always a subtly weird and wonderful lady, today it feels like she's broken down.

[Taichi]
"Se-Sempai?"

[Misato]
"Script......"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Pleeease write a draft."

She said with drowsy eyes.

[Taichi]
"A draft? Of what?"

[Misato]
"A draft of the pilot broadcast of the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, so you want a broadcast script that we can send flying through the air with this antenna."

[Misato]
"That's right. What we desire is intelligent emotion, tears and truth. Is a revival of well-aged youth culture refreshing to listeners' ears something beyond our Broadcasting Club's hands, I mean voices, to realize!?"

Several bottles of sake had been rolling around Sempai's feet.

[Taichi]
"Ooooooooh!!?"

[Misato]
"Lack of morals, overextended egoistic individualism, basic rights used to allow time to be spent lazily, modern society being infected by these kinds of corruptive hazards--
[Misato]
"Is it something we youngsters possessing mutually constructed friendships are capable of? I think our Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club is capable of providing a satisfactory answer to this question."

[Taichi]
"Your Japanese is really good..."

[Misato]
"Ku-ku-ku......"

She's laughing.
Her clenched fist wandered aimlessly in the air, then fell into her pocket.
It came out.
Holding a cup.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, aaah, aaah......"

This is reckless.
She looked wonderful, even when chugging sake.
She's like a middle-aged man......

[Misato]
"You'll write a manuscript."

She said with sunken eyes.

[Taichi]
"O...okay......"

[Misato]
"The deadline is Sunday."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Misato]
"Wonderful!"
[Misato]
"Then I think I shall rely on you to write that manuscript, and I think I'd like to take a nap here."

[Taichi]
"Why do you sound foreign?"

[Misato]
"Uuu."

She sprawled out on the floor.

[Taichi]
"You can't!"

[Misato]
"Kuhuhuhuhuhuhu."

[Taichi]
"Sempai, come on Sempai."

[Misato]
"Refreshing..."

Is she asleep?
That hard-working Sempai was drinking......

[Taichi]
"Umm, for now......why don't you sleep in the health room?"

[Misato]
"Go aheadly, Peke-kun......"

Sempai renounced all with those misinflected words.

[Taichi]
"You know I'm going to have to carry you there, right?"

[Misato]
"ZZZ......"

[Taichi]
"You know I might touch your breasts and butt, right?"
[Taichi]
"You know you might be missing your panties when you wake up, right?"
[Taichi]
"When you wake up......'Why do I feel a draft in my crotchy?......What?! I'm not wearing panties!? How did this happen!?

'Did I do anything slutty? It can't be......that's......no......ah, I'm wet......what have I been doing?'"

[Taichi]
"But I'll have been the one that did something!"

I punched my own temporal lobe.

[Taichi]
"Seriously......"

I'm a hopeless person.
To start with, I held Sempai up in a sitting position.
*plop*
Her head fell forward.
She really is sleeping.

[Taichi]
"......aaah, something......something about this feels wrong......"

*squeeze*
I hugged her.
A pair of sensations at my chest like balloons bursting.

[Taichi]
"I'm moved."

And my next movement......
My hands rummaged around her back,
Found her bra hook,
And unhooked it. (Required Time: 0.5 seconds)
I loosened the entire bra, and gradually pulled it out through the gap just above her necktie.
While it was still at body temperature, I affixed it to my nose.
The s-c-e-n-t.

[Taichi]
"......I have received my remuneration for nursing you, Misato-sempai."

I put it in my pocket, then began to carry Sempai on my back.
She's pretty heavy.
But the moderately emerging pair of sensations wouldn't stop.
Those breasts.
Bare boobs covered only by a single shirt.
My breathing became rough, and a tent was constructed.
The birth of Tentman.

[Taichi]
"Now, let's go."

Besides, there's no one watching.
Not good, not good.
The sensation spurring me on was so wonderful that I ended up walking all over the school for no reason.
Now...
There's no one in the health room.
I laid Sempai down on an empty bed.

[Taichi]
"Good night, Sempai. Sweet dreams."
[Taichi]
"......"

*kiss*

[Taichi]
"And now..."

Finally, the beginning of the day.
......no, it was just her cheek.
