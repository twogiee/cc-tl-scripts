No one's here.
I opened up my bentou by myself.

[Taichi]
*sigh*

As usual, a double portion.
With nothing else to do, I went to the roof again.
Kiri was there.
She looked around the outside world through the fence.
Deja vu pulled my consciousness away to the distant past.
Summer was starting to end.
The cicadas were remarkably noisy.
Crying voices that seemed to be beating me.
I could tell they were at the end of their lives.
A summer dyed with the dregs of life.
Kiri was on the roof.
Alone.
She'd been crying.
Even from behind, I could tell by the shaking of her shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Kiri......"

[Kiri]
"......Kurosu......sempai?"

She didn't hide her tears.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka......Yutaka, he......fell from here......"

[Taichi]
"Yeah......"

I knew.
There was no one who didn't know.
Not in this city.
In normal society, a student jumping to his death is a rather big topic.
His or her guardians ask the school questions about who was at fault, and try to bring them to light.
The school tries to evade responsibility.
That's not the case at Gunjou.
No one in society will come asking questions, and the school won't run away.
A number of people took responsibility.
Society couldn't care less about the dangerous boys and girls at Gunjou.
Very few were saddened by it.

[Kiri]
"No one......no one......feels sad......no one cares......how any of us feel......how any of us lived!"

She was unusually excitable.
A week had already passed since Yutaka's death.
Kiri's sorrow was belated.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Kiri......was Yutaka happy?"

[Kiri]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"Was he as happy as he could have been?"

An ordinary question.
But,
The meaning was exactly the opposite.

[Kiri]
"......he's always been in pain."

[Taichi]
"Always? Are you sure?"
[Taichi]
"There wasn't even a moment of happiness?"

[Kiri]
"That's......"

Undoubtedly, there was.

[Kiri]
"......after becoming friends with Sempai......he started smiling......"
[Kiri]
"But he wasn't recovering at all!"

Her tone strengthened.

[Kiri]
"He hadn't recovered from even a tiny bit of the pain he received!"

[Taichi]
"Then Kiri-chin thinks there was something lacking in Yutaka's life?"

[Kiri]
"That's not......what I meant......"

[Taichi]
"......I may say that, but sadness isn't a logical thing."

I'd been in doubt too.
About how to deal with Kiri.

[Taichi]
"It's okay to cry."

I looked up at the sky.
The pure white buried my field of vision in the moment before I came to understand that it was a huge cloud.

[Taichi]
"At least before summer ends."

Along with the last moments of the cicadas.
Did Kiri hear in that a meaning which included a thousand emotions?

[Kiri]
"......uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

She shut her eyes, grabbed my shirt sleeve and raised her voice.

[Kiri]
"Yuta-nii......he died......he's dead......"

Sobbing.

[Taichi]
"............"

Yuta-nii.
That was her beloved onii-chan.
He lived well, even with only one leg.
Kiri's parents---
On their faces, which I saw at Yutaka's funeral, there was light relief.
Was Kiri aware of that?
Most likely, she knew all about it.
Even after meeting so many cruel fates, those two continued to support one another.
In a sense, two halves of one body.
Kiri was only a half.
Just like me......
Except, Kiri wished to be that way.
Now, strong emotions deprived her of spirit.
But someday, her sadness will lessen, and she'll search for her other half.
Yutaka and Kiri.
Two people who were of one body and mind.
Kiri had no sins.
But I......my monster...stirred.

[Taichi]
"Kiri......"

I wrapped my hands around her back.
Violent passions made Kiri unable to sense approaching enemies, so she didn't notice.

[Kiri]
"Uuuuu......uaaaa......"

Little by little, her emotions subsided.
By then, I was completely embracing Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Kiri......are you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"You are lonely."

[Kiri]
"......Kurosu-sempai?"

[Taichi]
"I'm very empty."

I looked down at her small features.
Two deep obsidian stones leaked salt water on her face.

[Taichi]
"I think Yutaka was happy. Kiri was there, so he forgot all the bad things."
[Taichi]
"I think he was happy up until his final moments."

I moved my face closer.

[Kiri]
"............eh?"

She became a little confused.
Our faces crossed paths.
I stole her lips.

[Kiri]
"............!!?"

Her four limbs went berserk.
I held her tight.

[Kiri]
"......nna."

Kiri choked.
I pushed her against the fence, and continued sucking her lips.

[Kiri]
"......fua......no......stop......"

Surprise robbed Kiri of the ability to think.
She couldn't resist well.

[Taichi]
"Are you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"Aren't you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"......I don't......know......"

I kissed her.
The second time.
This time I invaded as far as the inside of the gums.
At the same time, I moved one hand inside her skirt.

[Kiri]
"Nn!......Nn, nnnnnnn!!?"

Her resistance suddenly strengthened.
Kiri pushed me away.

[Kiri]
"P-please stop!!!"

[Taichi]
"............"

I think I had a slight smile. I'm sure of it.

[Kiri]
"You are......"

I saw her shock slowly become covered in abhorrence.

[Kiri]
"--!!"

She ran away.
Passing right by me.
A creaking door. A closing door.

[Taichi]
"......haha."

I covered my face with my hands.
I see, this certainly is bad.
The corners of my mouth rose brutally.
Kiri and I became estranged.
She seldom showed up to club after that.
There were times Miki brought her along by force, but she avoided me.
We no longer conversed, and our relationship stopped.
That sort of thing happened---
