And then, Sunday.
The roof.
All the preparations had been made.

[Taichi]
"Good job."

[Misato]
"......you too, Peke-kun."

Sempai was a little weary.
//A "little exhausted" is oxymoronic. I think...Weary works just as well-Spin
That's why I informed her.

[Taichi]
"It's not over yet."

[Misato]
"......it isn't?"

[Taichi]
"We'll have to keep maintaining this broadcast channel."

[Misato]
"......"
[Misato]
"That's true."

[Taichi]
"Put 'er there."
//Dunno why, but "Put her there," doesn't sound like a handshake as much as "Put 'er there." - pondrthis

[Misato]
"Okay."

A handshake.
Sempai collected her tools, leaving them to one side, and looked up at the antenna.

[Misato]
"We'll be able to broadcast."

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"Though we can't say everything will go well just because we broadcasted."

I think so as well.
But it wasn't meaningless.
Even if she only wanted to keep moving.
//I know what you're trying to say in this line but I can't quite put it into words...-Spin
She simply can't keep our hearts in balance without doing something.
I'm that way too.
But my reason is a little different from everyone else's---

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, did you finish the manuscript?"

[Taichi]
"Y-yes, I did......"

Actually I hadn't.
Sempai smiled widely.

[Misato]
"Then, please be the DJ."

[Taichi]
"Eh?!"

[Misato]
"We won't have time to rehearse or do any retakes."
[Misato]
"So I'll leave it to you."

[Taichi]
"O-okay."

That might actually be convenient.
After all, the manuscript is just blank paper.
I'll have to come up with something appropriate.

[Tomoki]
"Taichiii, could you help me carry this equipment?"

[Taichi]
"O-kayyy."

When Tomoki came up, he took one look at Sempai.

[Misato]
"......"

[Tomoki]
"......"

They avoided each other's eyes.
But it wasn't as prickly as before.
For now, that's enough.
Later on, they'll be able to live with each other's faces no matter what happens.
Time is all we have. Too much time.
From then on we carried up the equipment.
In order to monitor from the roof.
The point of this was to allow the pilot broadcast to be live from the roof.

[Taichi]
"That Raba, of all times for him to be heartily skipping school."

[Tomoki]
"......wasn't he supposed to start today?"

[Taichi]
"Yep. That idiot."

[Sakuraba]
"Couldn't agree more."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Sakuraba]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Owa! Sakuraba! What are you doing here!?"

[Sakuraba]
"Friendship asks for---"

[Taichi]
"Nothing at all."

Gu!
We laughed invincibly with our thumbs up.

[Tomoki]
"This is not the place to use that phrase."

[Taichi]
"It's been a while, Raba."

[Sakuraba]
"Mm."

[Touko]
"......guh...the three idiots."

[Taichi]
"Oh."

Touko and the others came too.
Yes, the others.
Behind her were Miki and Kiri.

[Miki]
"Foooood mooornnniiinnng!" //NAT

She raised both hands in the air energetically as she screamed.
That loud voice made Kiri's eyebrows narrow and her shoulders curl up.
//Shrug carries implications. Perhaps curl up? Sounds like a recessive action. - Neko
//I agree with Neko.-Spin
There was a picture for this.
Titled "The Status Quo of Seven People."
Something we should have lost.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, what is this?"

Sempai pulled the edges of her clothes to straighten them.

[Taichi]
"Well, I struck a bit of a bargain."

[Misato]
"Struck a bargain......but, Peke-kun, but?"

[Taichi]
"I'm a super director, so that went well."

[Misato]
"......"

Sempai looked ready to cry.
//This seems to happen a lot. 〜IX
She was silent for a whole minute.
Then, finally,

[Misato]
"All members have assembled, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, Boss."

All personnel assembled.
Will this opportunity ever come again?
No, I just have to maintain this unity from now on!
......yeah right.
I can't do such a thing.
That's why,
Just for now,
I'll make memories.

[Taichi]
"Attention."

I raised one hand and called out to everyone.

[Taichi]
"Now, to celebrate the reconciliation of the Broadcasting Club, we shall now recommence our attack on the bread shop."
//Reconcentration isn't a word. Silly Ixrec -Neko
//Sounds like a sequel to World War II(purposely made it sound like I'm referencing a movie).-Spin

[Tomoki]
"Why would we do that?"

[Sakuraba]
"I thought you'd say that, so I came prepared to devour curry bread."

[Tomoki]
"Don't lie."

[Misato]
"By 'bread shop,' you mean that former yakuza place(*)? Can we win with only seven people?"

*The Tasaki Shop
//Place is too vague for a Yakuza line. Pull some gang slang here. -Neko

[Taichi]
"You're not seriously investigating the matter either."

[Tomoki]
"But it's definitely been a while since we were all together."

[Touko]
"......why are you looking at me?"

[Sakuraba]
"That's because you're a traitor who never bothered to show up at the club."

[Taichi]
"We don't want to hear that from you."

[Tomoki]
"We don't want to hear that from you."

I left a pause before countering (with violence) using my Fist of Extreme Bloodletting Power.
//Made it sound like a MMORPG weapon. Also, needed to change since "with" was used only two words apart.-Spin
Sakuraba sunk silently.
By the way, the roles assigned to each of the three men are:
Sakuraba = Funny Man
Tomoki = Straight Man
Taichi = All-Rounder
That's how it turned out.

[Taichi]
"I am the one to disentangle her heart with the power of love."

[Touko]
"Don't hug me!"

[Tomoki]
"......she really doesn't like that, you know?"

[Taichi]
"But her body's honest."

[Touko]
"I'll boil you!"

I ignored the elbow strikes bouncing off my head.

[Miki]
"Kirihara-sempai!!"

Miki hugged Touko's butt.

[Touko]
"Uyaa!!?"

Her scream was in a high octave.
Miki fondled her butt.

[Touko]
"St-stop that, Yamanobe!"

[Miki]
"So soft......too soft......"

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, only your figure is the best!"
//The "only" really threw it off but adding figure should be fine since Miki is hugging her ass anyway.-Spin

Touko's face tightened.

[Touko]
"Let go! Don't touch me!!"

[Miki]
"Sempaaai."

[Tomoki]
"A sexual harassment group."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah."

[Touko]
"Stop looking and do something!"

[Sakuraba]
"This is civil non-intervention."

[Touko]
"What about the police!?"

[Misato]
"Kirihara-san, have you been feeling better lately?"

[Touko]
"Do something about these two monkeys before starting a casual conversation."

[Misato]
"But those kids are living on instincts, so we can't do anything about them."

[Touko]
"Just talking peacefully......hey, wait, where are you touching!!?"
[Touko]
"Ah! Yan! Wa-......stop it already!!"

She started crying.

[Taichi]
"Ah......"

[Miki]
"Ah......"

We hurriedly stepped back.

[Sakuraba]
*sob*

[Taichi]
"Why are you crying!?"

[Sakuraba]
"But Kirihara's crying, isn't she?"

[Miki]
"So crying is contagious."

[Sakuraba]
"Super painful."

[Tomoki]
"You really do march to a different drummer."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, I'm sorry, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"............are you......an idiot?"

She slapped my back.

[Taichi]
"Ouch!"

It hurt like a whip.
Well, it's natural recompense......

[Kiri]
"......haa."

Kiri turned the other way and sighed.

[Taichi]
"Come on, I'll give you candy."

[Touko]
"......I don't care."

I grabbed her jaw and pushed in the candy by force, along with my fingers.

[Touko]
"Nnnnnn!!?"

[Taichi]
"Now taste the familiar flavor of a mother."
//SOS <---you know what this one means. 〜IX
//Save our ship? - pondrthis
//I'm always the guy in the end that has to deal with these weird lines...This one has got me beat though.-Spin

She tried to run away, but I wouldn't let go of her jaw.

[Touko]
"Nn!......Nmu! Nn!...*lick*......"

[Taichi]
"Oooone, twoooo......nooow then, I wonder how many we can fit in this cute hole of yours?"

[Touko]
"Nnnn! Nmu! Nnn, nn......hu!......nn......"

[Taichi]
"If you don't like it, why not bite down on my fingers?"

I could make out faint enmity in her open eyes.
But, as I rubbed around her mouth and pulled on her tongue, her eyelids closed shut.
Touko seemed to be sensitive on the inside of her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Threeee, fouuuur......heh heh heh heh, there, there."
//Imagine it like he's talking to a dog.-Spin

I pushed into the back of her mouth, thoroughly infringing on her.
//Is that what you meant? - pondrthis

[Touko]
"Nku! Nn...*lick*......Nhu! Nnnn......---!!"

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh, aren't they sweet?"

[Misato]
"Awawawawa."

[Miki]
"Ero Ero Essaim Ero Ero Essaim......"

[Tomoki]
"Ta-Taichiii, you can't do that, it's just too perverted (reverting to infancy)."
(TL Note: "Elohim Essaim" is part of a Medieval European spell from The Black Pullet for summoning demons. It's famous in Japan due to certain anime. Also, Miki is mis- pronouncing "elohim" as "ero," meaning "erotic.")

[Kiri]
"Th-that's why......I've been saying......this person is dangerous......"

[Sakuraba]
"To me it's just a part of 'give me candy.'"

With one exception, everyone was trembling violently.

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh......ha!!?"

My intended apology became bullying!?

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry, sorry."

I released her.
My fingers slid back, pulling out a thread of saliva.

[Touko]
"......nn, an!......"

Touko staggered away from me.

[Taichi]
"Well anyway, now that you've taken your daily dose of sugar, please live on energetically."

[Touko]
"Haa, haa......"

It took her a while to regain her senses, but then she glared piercingly at me.
While her mouth was filled with sweets, like a squirrel.

[Touko]
"......idiot!......Taichi, you idiot!"

[Miki]
"She has no retort for you."

[Taichi]
"Mmm."

[Kiri]
"......a bunch of children."

[Misato]
"Yes-yes, that's it for the recreation."

Sempai slapped her hands together.

[Touko]
"......it's not recreation......it's sexual harassment."

She was ignored.

[Misato]
"Sakura-san, Kirihara-san."

She called to the two estranged friends.

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Misato]
"Since we're all here, why don't we do this together?"

[Touko]
"......"

[Misato]
"There's very little real work left for the club, so you can just watch us to kill some time, right?"

Kiri and Touko.
Their lines of sight crossed just a bit.
These two both stood in delicate positions.

[Kiri]
"I'm..."
[Kiri]
"I'm just here because Miki called me."

[Misato]
"So you can't?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin......"

[Kiri]
"......I'll stick around until Miki leaves."

[Miki]
"Aha."

The atmosphere loosened. At least around her.
The other one remained stymied, and her face had grown even more sullen.
Holding her candy-filled mouth with her hands, she composed words.

[Touko]
"I came because Hasekura-sempai told me to!"
[Touko]
"But......since she doesn't seem to be here......"

She's trying to leave.
I grabbed her arm.

[Taichi]
"Umm, that was my-"

[Touko]
"Haa?"

[Taichi]
"I thought you just might come if she asked you by name..."

[Touko]
"I'm leaving."

[Taichi]
"Well, well..."

[Touko]
"If I'd been called here by you I wouldn't have come in the first place!"

[Taichi]
"Don't get mad now."

[Touko]
"You're always doing things like that whenever it's convenient for you! Just like that time!"
[Touko]
"Teasing and making fun of people...making them your toys...you enjoy that, don't you!? But why don't you try thinking just a little about my feelings!? Don't you dare think that just because you aren't getting hurt, no one else is!!"

[Miki]
"A quarr......"

*Quarr = Mikian for a lovers' quarrel.

[Tomoki]
"Shouldn't we stop it?"

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi, I desire candies."
//LMAO, this is my favorite line for this whole week(game week).-Spin

[Misato]
"You never change, Sakuraba-kun."

[Kiri]
"I get the feeling only the club president can stop this."

[Misato]
"I-I guess you're right."
//I know it doesn't say this in Japanese but it comes across better this way.-Spin
[Misato]
"Ummm......"
[Misato]
"Hey you."

[Touko]
"○＆□％▽×◇＄＃---!!"

[Sakuraba]
"It appears that the effect was zero."

[Misato]
"Gu......"

Hopeless. It seems I'll have to get this under control myself.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"What!?"

[Taichi]
"I love your angry face."

[Touko]
"What...are you saying?"

[Taichi]
"So why don't we have even more friendly fights like this in the future?"

[Touko]
"........................"

Touko exhaled deeply, her will collapsing.

[Touko]
"......fine. I'm tired anyway."

[Taichi]
"So you understand?"

[Touko]
"I said I'm tired. Can we hurry up with the club?"

[Taichi]
"Don't leave."

[Touko]
"......do as you wish."

Assent and understanding.
I pulled her by the hand back to everyone.
Touko kept looking down, saying nothing.

[Taichi]
"Captain, though I'm not sure how, I've succeeded in reproducing our lost days as a club."

[Misato]
"Ha?"

[Taichi]
"It's only patchy at best, but I've finished the renovation of these human relationships."

[Misato]
"Ha? Haa."

An unsatisfied face.
It's only natural. Each of these girls has distinct points of view.

[Misato]
"Anyway, we haven't all gathered together in a long time."

[Taichi]
"Yessir."
//Please, no comments about sir v maam. Taichi said "iessaa" which is definitely English for "yessir." 〜IX
//It's cool. I think it's much better also as "Yessir" rather than "Yes, Sir" if he's talking to a woman, as you had here. As a Southerner, I can confirm the usage of Sir and Ma'am here, haha. In other words, I'm against splitting up the word. - pondrthis

Having all seven of us here felt nostalgic.
This was the start of our club.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, can I let you handle the preparations?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, leave them to me."
[Taichi]
"But first, I have to go to the bathroom and get rid of a small-"

[Touko]
"Shut up and go, you idiot."

[Taichi]
"Hmmmph."

I'll harass you again later.

[Sakuraba]
"You're thinking of getting back at her with more harassment later, aren't you?"

[Taichi]
"I'm-I'm not thinking that far ahead!!"
[Taichi]
"Fuii."

I used the girls' bathroom to alleviate some frustration.
This is the room Touko's always using.

[Taichi]
"Huhun."

Feeling victorious, I washed my hands.
She was reflected in the mirror.
My hands stopped.

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan?"

[Youko]
"......"
//I feel like this would be better with visuals... This is Youko, but he was happy to use the bathroom Touko uses because he's harassing her. Since it's a damn fucking easy typo to make, I just want to clarify that the "She" reflected in the mirror is referring to a visual of Youko, not his thought about Touko... right? - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"So you did come to school. I see you're preternatural as always."

[Youko]
"Are you enjoying that farce of a club?"

I didn't think she would answer me, so I was surprised.
//That was a little freaky with all the contractions... - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"......it's no farce; it's a real club."

[Youko]
"But it has no meaning."

[Taichi]
"That's not true."
[Taichi]
"It's got plenty of meaning. For me, and for everyone else."

I smiled.
Yes, that club is truly meaningful.

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"You're not the type to sit still at home."
[Taichi]
"So, did you come out just to be sarcastic?"

[Youko]
"I'm not......being sarcastic......"

Her voice was crestfallen.

[Taichi]
"You even wore the uniform."
[Taichi]
"Since you're here, why not participate?"

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"It really is a club. We're about to start broadcasting."

[Youko]
"You can't do anything with that toy."

[Taichi]
"It's to comfort us, obviously."

[Youko]
"There's no meaning."

[Taichi]
"There's meaning in comfort."

[Youko]
"......I'll pass."

[Taichi]
"What if I clung to your shirt and begged you to participate?"

[Youko]
"I'd go."

It was simple.

[Taichi]
"......"(thinking)
[Taichi]
"What if I importuned you to give me the panties you're wearing right now?"

Her hands entered her skirt.

[Taichi]
"Aah, actually that's okay."

[Youko]
"......"

Her movements stopped.
Am I the main character of some ero game?
//He's using a term which specifies an actual gaming genre (obv, unique to Japan) which basically involves using fictional girls as sex toys. If anyone knows the correct English term for it, I'll write a tl note. 〜IX
//Ero should be fine, we should all know what it is at this point.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Then......it's okay if you just come and watch from a distance. Since you hate people."

[Youko]
"I don't hate them......I'm just uninterested."

She said casually.
//That works.-Spin
Even so, she's forcing herself to talk with all her strength.
She won't even tell other humans things they need to know.

[Taichi]
"But you are here, right when we're about to have our event, so why not participate with us?"

[Youko]
"......nn."

She nodded slightly and left the girls' bathroom.

[Taichi]
"Still..."

I'm impressed she noticed I went into the girls' bathroom......
She really is a super kunoichi.
I left the bathroom.
(TL Note: "Kunoichi" = "female ninja.")

[Taichi]
"Come to think of it, did you know that if you split up the kanji for 'woman' you get the characters that spell 『Kunoichi』?"

[Miki]
"First time I've heard of it."

She passed by me on my way out of the bathroom.

[Taichi]
"Umm......would you mind keeping it a secret that I entered the girls' bathroom?"

I clung to her sleeve.

[Miki]
"That's a good question...whatever shall I do...?"

[Taichi]
"Especially from Kirihara."

[Miki]
"Then it's okay if I tell Kiri-chin?"

[Taichi]
"Aaan! You can't do that either!"

Aren't those two the foremost cold-blooded girls in my school?

[Miki]
"Miki wants to eat nata de coco."

[Taichi]
"Well, I can get you agar."
(TL Note: "Nata de coco," or "Cream of the Coconut" is a jelly-like fermentation of coconut water and seaweed extracts from the Philippines, often containing pickles, ice cream, puddings and/or fruits.)

[Miki]
"Then I'm going to open my mouth big and wide right here, right now..."
(TL Note: "Agar" is the vegetable gelatin used in Petri dishes as a growth medium for bacteria.)

[Taichi]
"Mercy!"
[Taichi]
"Hello, hello."

[Misato]
"We've just finished setting everything up."

[Taichi]
"It's time for the super-charismatic DJ, I take it?"

[Sakuraba]
"That is to say, a super goose......"
//Not really getting this.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Have at thee!!"

Backward Roundhouse Kick.

[Sakuraba]
"Gufu!"

[Taichi]
"How dare you say such things in front of these maidens!!!?"

[Tomoki]
"They all know it already."

[Sakuraba]
"......that hurt bad."

I didn't respond to the resilient Sakuraba.

[Misato]
"Oookay, the third-rate comedy ends here. Now let's get started."

[All Three]
"Yeees."

The men moved out hesitantly.
Kiri stayed back and watched over everyone.
Without Miki, she's isolated and has nowhere to be.

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

Kiri turned away without answering.
Irritated, she planted her heels firmly.
For crying out loud......

[Miki]
"Back."

Miki returned.
She naturally stood by Kiri.
These two.
Kiri looked like a protector, and it was true Miki was at the core of her attention.
It was the exact opposite of a relationship where they simply observed and supported each other.
Their arrangement made me feel something controlling.
My heart rustled.
But right now I have to think about the broadcast.
The manuscript only has an introduction.
Come to think of it, I can't see Youko-chan anywhere.
She said she'd participate, so she ought to be here somewhere.
I searched.
There were six things actively moving within a twenty meter radius.
But just beyond that, I felt a slight incongruity.
The water tower.

[Taichi]
"There she is."

As I feared, she was hiding atop the water tower.
A small shadow was barely moving.
That was her.
A movement no greater than a quiver.
But no matter how slight the motion, I could see it.
In this dreary world, I'd become more sensitive than anyone.
//Fuckin' vampires. - pondrthis
//Fuckin' vampires. - Neko
//Vampires fuckin'. - Spin

[Taichi]
"She really does have no interest."

[Tomoki]
"Eh? What?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, I wasn't saying that to Tomoki."
[Taichi]
"Now, broadcast, broadcast."

[Miki]
"Is there a name for the channel we're broadcasting on?"

[Misato]
"Nnn, we never decided that."

[Sakuraba]
"May I?"

[Misato]
"Go ahead Sakuraba-kun."

[Sakuraba]
"Terror Hell Broadcast Channel."

[Misato]
"Ei!"

Bogu!
The president's punch sunk into Sakuraba.

[Misato]
"Rejectedddd. Anyone else?"

[Sakuraba]
"That hurt..."

[Tomoki]
"You really are an idiot."

[Sakuraba]
"But, but, doesn't that have impact?"

[Taichi]
"Then just try saying 'bam, bam' wherever appropriate."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"Super ninja."

[Misato]
"......"

[Miki]
"Sexual Harassment Bushido."

[Sakuraba]
"Bewitchingly Lewd Beauty, by Vague ***** Dream."
(TL Note: "Bushido," or "Way of the Warrior" is the code of honor followed by samurai.)

[Tomoki]
"Broadcast Club."

It seemed the directionality of this conversation had been set by the first idea.

[Taichi]
"Super Ninja."

[Miki]
"Spin-Spin-Pow Broadcast Channel."

All persons at that location poked Miki in an obligatory and businesslike manner.

[Miki]
"Owowow......that hurt......"

[Misato]
"Impenitence is prohibited."

[Miki]
"I'm not doing that..."

I toed the mark again.

[Taichi]
"Super ninja."

[Tomoki]
"Is that your only line......?"

[Sakuraba]
"What kind of ninja?"

[Taichi]
"You might say...ultra super, mega future..."

I explained with gestures.

[Taichi]
"She can jump walls ten meters high. And, she swings around her beloved sword Kogarashimaru."

[Tomoki]
"Will she kill the evil magistrate?"
(TL Note: "Kogarashimaru" appears to mean "Blade of the Cold Winter Wind.")

That was so boring.

[Taichi]
"Yeah."
[Taichi]
"She also kills village girls."

[Tomoki]
"She's a psychopath!"

[Sakuraba]
"......psychopath."

[Misato]
"Rejected."

[Tomoki]
"Put a little effort into your ideas."

[Sakuraba]
"That's hard."

[Misato]
"Please move away from the negativity."

Sempai screamed through a megaphone (she had one).

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."
[Taichi]
"Mimimi-sempai's Pink G-Spot."

[Misato]
"One-two!"

Bogu!
I was hit.
By a beautiful mid-level straight punch.

[Taichi]
"Oufu!"

[Misato]
"Don't you think vulgar names are intolerable?"

[Taichi]
"Oui." (French)

[Sakuraba]
"Let's make The Flowers the DJs."

[Taichi]
"EEH!?"

[Miki]
"We need to ask Kiri-chin."

[Taichi]
"Th-that's...wait......"

[Sakuraba]
"It should be a gal."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

I understand, but,
They're unskilled.

[Miki]
"In that case,"

She ran.

[Miki]
"---"

[Kiri]
"---"

She returned.

[Miki]
"She says, 'Save the nonsense for after death, you porgies.'"

[Sakuraba]
"Hu!......harsh as always."

Sakuraba wiggled happily. That's because he's a masochist.

[Taichi]
"What's a porgy?"

[Misato]
"She must mean the Japanese Black Porgy. It has a weird face."

[Sakuraba]
"Weird face?"

[Misato]
"Something like this."

[Taichi]
"Damn it Kiri, be cautious of your chastity when walking the streets at night!"

[Kiri]
"......(hmph)"

[Taichi]
"Grrr, that girl...!"

[Tomoki]
"Well, well..."

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, somehow I've gotten tired."

[Misato]
"You're saying that?"

It's true there was a sense of war weariness floating around.
This is what happens when a bunch of people bankrupt in personality have an exchange.

[Taichi]
"That's right, what's Kirihara's opinion?"

[Touko]
"Ha?"

[Taichi]
"You are a club member after all, so say something, you pig."

[Touko]
"Hmph."

She exhaled from her nose as if this was a nuisance.

[Touko]
"......The Idiots (plural)."

[Sakuraba]
"You-! You're just making fun of us because you happen to be rich!"

[Tomoki]
"So are you."

[Taichi]
"So are you."

At the same time, we delivered the same counter (with violence), knocking Sakuraba into the ground.

[Tomoki]
"Aren't you also a rich idiot? Now stay down there."

[Sakuraba]
"......sorry......"

[Taichi]
"It's true this guy's an idiot, but I can't agree with that idea, Kirihara."

[Touko]
......*fuming*

[Miki]
"It doesn't look like we'll reach a decision."

[Taichi]
"What's Sempai's opinion?"

[Misato]
"......good question."

She must agree that we can't leave it in the hands of these idiots.
Sempai folded her arms and thought.

[Misato]
"Since Peke-kun is the DJ......Kurosu Channel."
//Three Cheers for Misato!!! Hip-hip, Hooray! - pondrthis

[Sakuraba]
"That's easy."

[Taichi]
"But it's the only serious one."

[Miki]
"Plus, it has the name of a guy I like so it's cute!"
[Miki]
"......that's what Kiri-chin whispered hotly into my ears."

[Kiri]
"I didn't say that!!!"

Far away, Kiri got angry.

[Taichi]
"Dammit, Sakura Kiri, I challenge you to a date for hiding the fact that you've been finding me moe all this time!!"

[Kiri]
"I didn't say that!!!"

[Tomoki]
"That aside......why not make Kurosu into Cross?"

[Misato]
"Aaah, the English word?"

When Sempai spoke to him, Tomoki hesitated for a moment.

[Tomoki]
"......well yeah."

[Misato]
"Cross Channel? Yeah, that's good."

Her expression remained complex.

[Tomoki]
"Well, isn't that okay......?"

[Misato]
"What does Peke-kun think?"

[Taichi]
"I accept the crowning of my name with ever- exceeding delight."

[Sakuraba]
"Wait."

[Taichi]
"My friend, you seem sullen. If I didn't know better, I'd think you had some sullen ulterior motive for complaining about this utterly marvelous naming sense."

[Sakuraba]
"Not Cross Channel. It should be CROSS†CHANNEL."

[Tomoki]
"I don't understand......I really don't understand this guy......"

[Taichi]
"Isn't that a good thing?"

[Tomoki]
"How does that make any sense?"

[Sakuraba]
"Have some faith."

[Taichi]
"I'll admit, coming from you, that's a pretty good idea."

It's decided.
The grand opening of the Gunjou Institute broadcast channel: CROSS†CHANNEL.

[Taichi]
"Okay, Tomoki, broadcast! Light the fire in the boiler!"

[Tomoki]
"There isn't one."

[Sakuraba]
"Full starboard."

[Tomoki]
"Is this a ship?"

For some reason Tomoki's comebacks were all businesslike.

[Touko]
"The idiot trio."

She whispered with irritation.

[Taichi]
"If we weren't all idiots, we wouldn't have all gathered here."

[Touko]
"?"

[Misato]
"It would be nice......if it really was everyone."

Sempai exhaled melancholy.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, Kirihara, since you're here, be sure to get wet over the fluency of my speech."

[Touko]
"......too stupid."

Touko turned the other way and put a candy in her mouth.
She chewed it to pieces.

[Taichi]
"Are you embarrassed?"

I peeked at her face from below. The distance between our lips was five centimeters.

[Touko]
"Kyanooooooo!!?"

Touko fused 『Kyaa』 and 『Nooo』 into a novel scream while beating her fist into someone's face.

[Taichi]
"So, shall we begin?"

[Miki]
"Good thing this isn't a medium which sends pictures."

[Taichi]
"I couldn't agree more."

That way no one would be able to see the mark of the blow.
I sat in front of the readied mike.
A nice breeze this evening.
It was gently sweeping the roof, and taking away the remaining wisps of heat.
I braced myself.
I looked toward Youko-chan, giving her a thumbs-up.

[Youko]
"......"

She returned the gesture immediately.

[Misato]
"......Hasekura......san?"

Only the president noticed our exchange.

[Taichi]
"Yeees."
[Taichi]
"All the members are here."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun......did you?"

[Taichi]
"Though it's certainly a farce of a club,"

Unsubstantial,
Lazy and idle,
It was a deception I could do nothing about.

[Taichi]
"The time we have right now is an important thing."

[Misato]
"......"

Sempai froze up, and stood still in that spot.

[Misato]
"Then, I'm just......"
[Misato]
"With such noble reasons......!!"

[Taichi]
"I'm telling you, it's fine, don't worry about your true intentions."
[Taichi]
"Everyone's in the club. That's the end of it."

[Misato]
"I......"

All the members are here.
Everyone is right here.
That doesn't simply mean that all the members of the Broadcasting Club are here.
The remains of friendships, formed atop many lies and deceits.
That sort of thing would, just a little bit, for those of us who live in this world, extend our lifespans and the time limit on the breakdown of our hearts.

[Tomoki]
"Go ahead, Taichi."

[Miki]
"Six o'clock in five, four......"

Miki closed her mouth, and counted down on her fingers.
Three.
I'd been dreaming.
Two.
About a daily life befitting normal school kids, in just such a self-involved club.
One.
If I have the memory, that's enough.
Zero.
I'm satisfied---
I took a deep breath.
I released the manuscript.
The evening breeze, with its summer scent, stole away those papers as if pulling a prank.

[Misato]
"Ah!?"

The manuscript stretched out and upward, scattering the pages apart in mid-air.
Now, the broadcast.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club."

Even if I understand this is pointless,
I want to live on while clinging to it.
And then, I pushed out words.
