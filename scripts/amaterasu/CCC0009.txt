......it's approaching me.

[Taichi]
"Mu."

Murderous intent.
It was stuck to the store's entrance.
I looked inside.
An enemy? Or a friend?

[Taichi]
"......mountain?"

[Miki]
"......river."
[Miki]
"Heaven and Earth?"

[Taichi]
"Body odor leading the pack."

[Miki]
"......go ahead."

I entered the store.

[Taichi]
"So it's you, Miki......I wondered who it was."

[Miki]
"Good morning, Sempai."

[Taichi]
"Since you were giving off murderous intent, I wasn't sure."

[Miki]
"If something happens inside a closed space, wouldn't you hate it if there was nowhere to run to?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

My thoughts raced through old memories.

[Taichi]
"Since you're wearing your uniform, perhaps you intend to go to school?"

[Miki]
"That's true. There's nothing else to do after all."

[Taichi]
"Same as me."

[Miki]
"Yes it is."

She was innocent.

[Taichi]
"A drink for me too."

[Miki]
"Have this."

[Taichi]
"Thank you for always choosing drinks with high reality."

It is known to those who know as Ne**n.
//.....What? Sorry, I don't get that sentence at all O.o - Sheeta
Drink it all down! All at once!

[Miki]
"It's best if you don't look at the expiration date."

[Taichi]
"Gehaa!!"

It entered my windpipe.

[Taichi]
"Geho! Gaho!!"

[Miki]
"Smash hit."

Posing.

[Taichi]
"......don't trap people like that!"

[Miki]
"I'm sooorry."

A smile swelled up on her face.

[Taichi]
"Ke! You oboko!"
//crap, a reference to one of the earliest scenes in the game. Hopefully repeating the tl note is the right move here. 〜IX
//Yep. I definitely don't remember it - Sheeta

I spat out.
(TL Note: "Oboko" is a very obscure word for "virgin".)

[Miki]
"I think I'll throw it away when I reach twenty."

[Taichi]
"You should be there pretty soon."

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Be as you are now for all eternity."

[Miki]
"......I have a feeling I could, but that's impossible."

It probably is.
No, more importantly,

[Taichi]
"So, who will you give it to?"

[Miki]
"......eh? Hmmm......Katou Falcon."

[Taichi]
"So you value technique!?"
(TL Note: This is a nickname for Katou Taka, since "taka" means "falcon." He is probably the most famous male porn star in Japan, and is known for being incredibly skilled at inducing female orgasms.)

I lamented.
Isn't he one of the leading technicians in Japan?
......I can't beat him.
(TL Note: Taichi is incorrectly assuming that the English word "technician" means "one who is skilled in certain techniques" rather than "one who is skilled with technology".)

[Taichi]
"I can't match Falcon, but I do have my own technique."

[Miki]
"Sempai's techniques are all just sexual harassment, and as such I have terrible doubts about whether they'll be useful during the real thing, so I regret to inform you that I'm refusing you."

Such a masculine poetic style that her sentence ended on a low formality level.
//this feels equally meaningless in Japanese 〜IX
That style of refusal broke my heart.

[Taichi]
"Damn! You say that, but are you not actually trying to offer yourself to Kiri-chin? You lustful virgin?"

[Miki]
"In fact, I will rob Kiri-chin of her virginity."

[Taichi]
"Ah! I want to participate in that!"

As my desires multiplied, my fanboy level peaked at 82%.

[Miki]
"And for that reason we'll go to school together."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, let's go."

We went to school together holding hands.

[Taichi]
"Underneath the clear blue sky♪"

[Miki]
"Two friends who are very close♪"

We made it to school during that careless duet.

[Miki]
"............"
[Miki]
"Ah, no good. I forgot Kiri-chiii's drink."

You say that after arriving at school?

[Taichi]
"You damned fool. You lack training."

[Miki]
"I will return."

[Taichi]
"Climb up and down the hills as much as you like."

[Miki]
"Heeei."

She rushed off pleasantly.
A young little thing.

[Taichi]
"......"
