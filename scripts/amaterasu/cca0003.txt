The new term starts today.
Being in a house with no female presence, the process from "waking up" to "going to school" had no cutesy elements to speak of, so I left promptly without following any particular train of thought.
My first walk to school in a month and a half.
The weather was nice.
Though it's still the beginning of September, it hasn't gotten too hot yet.
My bangs softly glided over my eyelids.
That's the only slight discomfort.

[Taichi]
"I really wanted to get this cut......"

Depressing.
Because of the color, I don't like my hair that much.

[Taichi]
*sigh...*

I started down the road to school while playing with my bangs.
Walking, walking.
Next time, I should have someone else cut it.
Yeah, I'll do that.

[Girl]
"Heya!"

[Taichi]
"Yahey."

The girl riding the bike lined herself up next to me with extremely natural timing.
Though tottering, she skillfully kept her balance while matching my pace.
That's not something which handles itself well at walking speeds.
Her bike seemed to be quite an expensive type.
It was well suited for this merry girl.

[Girl]
"Up we go."

She tried doing a slight wheelie.
Ah, I saw her panties.
White. Too white.
Pure white.
Solid white really is a great color. A wonderful color.
I wanna see more...
Ah, I can't see it anymore.
*ka-chink*

[Girl]
"Hey, Tai-chan, have you ever been to the other side of the mountain?"

The girl who'd brilliantly tickled my male heart with a piece of cloth turned her neck in my direction.

[Taichi]
"I have. I was camping out there until just recently."

[Girl]
"For summer vacation?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Girl]
"......hmmm, so that's how..."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean, 'that?'"

[Girl]
"Oh no, it's just that, you know, there's a god in that area."

The two of us stared at each other for a while.
Then, at the same exact time,

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahaha."

[Girl]
"Ahahahahaha."

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahahahahaha."

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahahahahahaha."
[Girl]
"That place happens to be one of his favorites."

[Taichi]
"Don't continue on like nothing happened."

[Girl]
"Oh no, you should be laughing at this. I'd do the same if someone said that to me with a straight face."

[Taichi]
"Then you made that straight face just to make me laugh?"

[Girl]
"Yes, but......this is a bit of a serious topic."

[Taichi]
"A god?"

[Girl]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"If you write that in English it's spelled g-o-d."

The two of us stared at each other for a while.

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahaha."

[Girl]
"Ahahahahaha."

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahahahahaha."

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahahahahahaha."
[Girl]
"......this conversation's going nowhere... (crying)"

[Taichi]
"There, there, I'll listen to you. What is it about god? First off, what kind of god is it?"

[Girl]
"Aaah, Nanaka-san doesn't know that either."

[Taichi]
"Oh my......!?"

That moment, I froze.

[Taichi]
"Huge discovery! Wouldn't that "Nanaka" be way hotter if she wrote her name in hiragana rather than kanji!?"

[Nanaka]
"I know that."

She said sharply.
She doesn't seem to be the type to follow abrupt changes in direction.

[Nanaka]
"Hey, isn't there a hokora around here?"

[Taichi]
"If you write 'hokora' in katakana, it sounds like a highly contagious disease."
(TL Note: A hokora is a small Shinto shrine.)

[Nanaka]
"Hey, isn't there a hokora around here?"

She must not want to follow another tangent.

[Taichi]
"On the side of that patch through the forest?"

[Nanaka]
"Yep, yep."
[Nanaka]
"Oh!!"

As she lifted the handlebars for another wheelie, she executed a jump using only the rear tire.
There was no reason for it, but it was still a pretty good trick.

[Taichi]
"Gorcious."

*Gorgeous + delicious

[Nanaka]
"Isn't it?"

A proud smile.
Just for a moment, I was slightly enamored with her.

[Nanaka]
"The god of the hokora is intensely gorcious."
[Nanaka]
"Even if nuclear war breaks out, they say he favors this land enough to protect it."

[Taichi]
"I don't buy it."
[Taichi]
"However much gun insurance you may have, it's powerless to protect you from a gun."

[Nanaka]
"That's beside the point."

[Taichi]
"21st Century gods ought to be more minimal and precise with their actions."
[Taichi]
"Like a god who, when your girlfriend cheated on you with a much cooler guy, would leak it to you via a text message the moment it got physical."

[Nanaka]
"Any society partisan enough to agree with that must be on its last legs."

[Taichi]
"Japan is calmly going mad."

[Nanaka]
"Up again!"

This time standing on the front wheel.
I'm surprised.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, that bike is amazing!"

[Nanaka]
"The bike is......?"

[Taichi]
"Lemme ride it, lemme!"

[Nanaka]
"No. Amateurs rejected."

[Taichi]
"That's harsh."

[Nanaka]
"One time, my father took it for a spin without asking..."
[Nanaka]
"He fell off and hurt himself before coming back."
[Nanaka]
"We had such a big fight..."
[Nanaka]
"Whenever I asked about his injury, he'd just feign ignorance."

[Taichi]
"......your papa must be a hassle."

[Nanaka]
"He ordered mom to do the same."

[Taichi]
"Is he a demon?"

[Nanaka]
"He docked my allowance for three months."

[Taichi]
"I can almost see the family portrait with such a simple flow of emotions."

[Nanaka]
"Around that time, he hacked into a coworker's computer for fun and......he put in a program to automatically generate vulgar words inside all of the guy's public folders."

An immature adult......

[Nanaka]
"However, he mistook his target, and smeared his supervisor's computer with dirty words!"

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahaha!"

[Nanaka]
"Ahahahahaha!"

This girl's father is a moron.

[Nanaka]
"That got his salary cut for three months. Mom couldn't stop laughing!"

[Taichi]
"......the world would be at peace if all families were like that."

[Nanaka]
"Well, if they were still around, yeah."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

*hop*
The bike did a wheelie again.
Ah, I saw her panties!
Second sighting!

[Nanaka]
"Up we go."

I saw them again, ah, aaaah!!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahh!!!
Pure white, pure white, pure white!!
Eat 'em up, eat 'em up, eat 'em up!!
Bravo!!! Amorous sigh!!!!

[Taichi]
"Uu..."

I fell to my knees.

[Nanaka]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"......just now, my intellect was at risk of declining......"

[Nanaka]
"Aaah, so your intellect is unstable?"

[Taichi]
"I wonder if that bicycle seat likes the feeling of..."

[Nanaka]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing......forget it."

My rationality finally returned.
I'm really weak against unforeseen erotic events.
I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Now, let's go to school."

[Nanaka]
"Why are you leaning so far forward?"

[Taichi]
"......you're seriously asking that with such a young and innocent voice?"

[Nanaka]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Other than it being the result of a spatial dilemma relating to my lowermost parts, I can make no comment."

[Nanaka]
"My butt hurts..."

[Taichi]
"An oboko really shouldn't be......"

[Nanaka]
"What's an 'oboko?'"

[Taichi]
"Your butt hurts."
(TL Note: Oboko is an extremely obscure word for virgin derived from a term for baby flathead mullet.)

[Nanaka]
"Hmmm."

Yes, I distracted her.

[Nanaka]
"Take care! It'd be bad if your descendants prospered!"

[Taichi]
"Make me some descendants!"

[Nanaka]
"So honest about his desires it's disgusting."

[Taichi]
"......an unexpected attack brings out true intentions."

I really felt like thinking twice about what I just did.

[Taichi]
"Any guy upon seeing a cute girl will rear the ugly red snake head of their desires."
[Taichi]
"So you're a red snake."
[Taichi]
"Ah, but normally blue snakes are safe."

[Nanaka]
"Are your friends yellow snakes?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you might say a half-erec......"

I became doubtful as I said that.
I timidly turned back.

[Taichi]
"......are you fed up with this?"

Nanaka smiled brightly.

[Nanaka]
"No, I'm happy."

[Taichi]
"Wha-?"

[Nanaka]
"Hey now, get walking."
[Nanaka]
"I'll ride backward until your corpus cavernosum goes back to sleep."

[Taichi]
"So you knew it all along, you bitch......"
(TL Note: The corpus cavernosum is the predominant region of the male erectile tissue.)

I still bore deep wounds from the Sakuraba bicycle incident.

[Nanaka]
"Ooohh, the schooool, it's coming into viewww♪"
[Nanaka]
"It's whiiite, it's newww, must've cost a looot..."

[Taichi]
"Would you mind transferring?"
[Taichi]
"I think you can still get admitted without an entrance exam."

[Nanaka]
"What about the uniform?"

[Taichi]
"I-I'll make it for youuuuuu!"

[Nanaka]
"......wouldn't you just cut out round holes at the chest?"

[Taichi]
"Hey! I'd never do something so devilish!!"
[Taichi]
"......just, the skirt size...would be three centimeters shorter than usual......if that's not a problem, then......"

[Nanaka]
"Such a wimpy form of harassment......"
[Nanaka]
"Any-way, I'd better get going."

She pivoted her bike one hundred and eighty degrees. In place.
Her motor skills were impressive.

[Nanaka]
"Hey, boy. What I said about the hokora is all true."

[Taichi]
"......eh?"

Her words had a meaning I couldn't take in.

[Nanaka]
"If you're ever at a complete standstill......go check it out."

[Taichi]
"Ah, okay......"

Her expression clouded as she exhaled.

[Nanaka]
"Not that anything will change, even if I tell you this."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka......"

[Nanaka]
"Whoops, this is starting to sound like some official mission. We can't have that."

She spun around in place with another wheelie.
After the first revolution, she was already smiling.

[Nanaka]
"See ya♪"

Beautifully waving her bundle of fingertips.
She touched the tips of her toes to the pedals.

[Taichi]
"Ah, one question."

To her departing back.

[Nanaka]
"Whaaat?"

[Taichi]
"We've never met before, so how did you know my name?"

[Nanaka]
"Oh...if you want an answer to that......"

A white fingertip shot out, pointing to me.
No, to something behind me.
I turned around, and for several seconds the school was in my field of vision.
No response.
I returned my gaze to Nanaka.
She'd disappeared.
Along with her bike.
Not a phenomenon which could be explained just by the speed of her bike.

[Taichi]
"............huh?"

The cicadas weren't chirping. A quiet new term.
