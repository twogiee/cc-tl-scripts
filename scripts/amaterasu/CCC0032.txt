At some point, it became midday.
After all, with only eight people, we don't bump into each other much.
Youko-chan's sandwiches.
There were a few too many.

[Taichi]
"No helping it, I'll eat them alone......"

I can eat them somehow. I'm having a growth spurt.
All the hairs on my back stood up abruptly.
As if I was being targeted from behind by a soldier with a machine gun.

[Taichi]
"Yo-Youko-chan......"

[Youko]
"............"

She stood there.
She only stood there.
Her usual approach.
Perhaps because her presence had such a keen structure, I could never get used to it.

[Taichi]
"Sudden as always."

[Youko]
"............"

I pinched her nose.

[Taichi]
"Speak."

[Youko]
"Du you meed anyfing frum mi?"
//Feel free to mess with this if you know a better way to convey muffled speech. ã€œIX

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

I thought.

[Taichi]
"Nothing in particular."

[Youko]
"............"

When I released my hand, she ran two meters away and stood there.

[Taichi]
"Even so, it's hard to eat a double portion by myself."

I opened the paper bag and put a sandwich in my mouth.

[Youko]
"........................"

Under that noh mask of a face, just what complications were developing?
//noob TL for noh? - Sheeta
After a while, her shoulders fell slightly.
Dejectedly.

[Youko]
"......I moved out of my apartment."

[Taichi]
"Eh? Why?"

[Youko]
"I'm going back."

[Taichi]
"To my place?"

Nod.

[Taichi]
"......no."

I told her it would be useless.

[Youko]
"......why not?"

[Taichi]
"I can't calm down."

[Youko]
"There's no one here anymore......I think it's fine if we live together just as before......"
//Sounded like it needed something.-Spin

[Taichi]
"I think it's fine to live free and easy by myself."

Our opinions split.
She made a face as if chewing a bitter insect. (Youko-chan's version/largely expressionless)

[Youko]
"......Taichi is always hard on me."

[Taichi]
"You're too overprotective."

[Youko]
"I think I'm only doing the obvious thing."

That might be the case, but,

[Taichi]
"Anyway, no. I enjoy living alone to the fullest extent."
//This one also sounded like it needed something. I know that "extent" works but it just doesn't sound exactly right either. What do you think?-Spin

[Youko]
"............I see."

Dejected.
I ate a sandwich while that girl, absorbed in a rhythm of dejection, stood in the corner of my eye.

[Youko]
"......"

I was being stared at.

[Youko]
"............"

I continued to be stared at.

[Youko]
"........................"

It was seen through.
The sound of Youko-chan's stomach.

[Taichi]
"......lunch?"

[Youko]
"I haven't eaten."

[Taichi]
"Must be rough."

[Youko]
"Not long ago, I heard you say, 'No helping it, I'll eat them alone...'"

[Taichi]
"I said that."

*munch* *munch* *munch* *munch*

[Taichi]
"I truly am doing that right now."

[Youko]
"......even though there are two people here."

[Taichi]
"What was that? I can't hear you very well?"

[Youko]
"......Taichi immediately harasses me......"

[Taichi]
"These are delicious."

*munch* *munch* *munch* *munch*

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"These are really delicious."

*munch* *munch* *munch* *munch*

[Youko]
"......"

The two of us stayed in that unpopular hallway. My chewing, Youko-chan's stomach bug and the sound of me taking sandwiches out of the plastic bag. It was all in complete harmony.
An incomprehensible stress swelled up.
