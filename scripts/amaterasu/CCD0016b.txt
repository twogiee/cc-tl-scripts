[Taichi]
"I have to thank you, Miki."

[Miki]
"Eeeh? That's okay, I don't......"

But Miki-chin was restless with anticipation.
Lust painted over shame.
In a certain sense, I'm able to live without bending to outside pressure because I have lust.
I took Miki's hand.

[Taichi]
"Love me tenderly."

I kissed the back of her hand.

[Miki]
"Awaaa."

She was stunned.
Miki is weak when treated like a princess.
I kissed her once more.

[Miki]
"Don't do that......"

She didn't seem to dislike it at all.

[Kiri]
"............"

An incredible pressure was coming from Kiri.
A rain of kisses fell down.

[Miki]
"You're too kind..."

I held her shoulders.

[Miki]
"Fueh?"

I took her hair and put my lips to it.

[Miki]
"Like that movie......with the luxurious ocean liner......"

[Taichi]
"Love to the third power."

[Miki]
"I don't really understand, but there seems to be an amazing synergy effect."

I brought my face to her cheek from behind.

[Miki]
"Uhya?"

Still, this person isn't really disliking it.

[Kiri]
"......gunuu."

The aura from Kiri was starting to become physical.

[Taichi]
"I might have been infected by Miki's charm."

[Miki]
"Ah, is, is that so?"

[Taichi]
"There's something on your eyelid, close your eyes for a second."

[Miki]
"......okay."
[Miki]
"Thump, thump."

Ah, I can steal her lips.
Change of plans.

[Taichi]
"Kissss......"

[Kiri]
"I won't let you do that!!"

She flew toward me.

[Taichi]
"Wa! Wa!?"

[Miki]
"Kyaa!?"

[Kiri]
"You molesteeer!!!"
//So that's the sound bite for Kiri in Nanaca Crash.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Gyaaa!"

Failure to steal her lover.
