Accept it?
I will accept death?
Impossible, I thought.
I don't think I can assent to my own death.
I have strong self-preservation instincts.
I should be tenacious like a desert insect.
And yet, against Kiri's hatred, I was quite hesitant.
I unexpectedly lost my temper.
Even though I should live,
Even though I have nothing but despair,
Even though I have to be laughing,

[Taichi]
"Kiri......stop this."

I took one step forward.

[Taichi]
"This is no time for us to be killing each other, right?"

I took one step forward.

[Taichi]
"I understand that you hate me, but to kill me because of that..."

I took one step forward.

[Taichi]
"Isn't that nonsense?"

I took one step forward.

[Taichi]
"That won't help either of us. You're in danger too."

If Youko-chan saw it...
Kiri might die one second later.
But, how should I explain it to her?
Explain how scary she is...
I was impatient.
I accidentally pried too far.

[Taichi]
"As for Yutaka---"

[Kiri]
"---!!!"

A light cry. Of the air.
Right in my chest, there was a solid black arrow sticking in like a joke.

[Taichi]
"Uuaa......"

I made a blunder.
I sat down in that spot from the shock of being shot.
There's no pain.
It's not unnatural at all.
I couldn't feel how near death was.
This is really bad......aren't I suffering?
I slowly fell down sideways.
I collapsed within the forest of desks.
I could no longer see Kiri.

[Taichi]
"......ha!......ha!......ha!......"

Shallow breathing.
I still won't die?
I know that a great suffering was coming closer.
......aaah, I don't want this.
I learned that instant death was happiness.

[Taichi]
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!---"

I realized my breathing was becoming frighteningly shallow.
My consciousness grew hazy.
I heard Kiri's scream.
The sound of glass breaking.
Outside my field of vision...something...ate into...flesh.

[Taichi]
"Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!---ha---"

My breathing abruptly stopped.
As if my eyeballs had muddied, all became dark.
In my final moment,

[Youko]
"......!"

I saw her.
