I passed the school and headed for the housing complex where Miki lives.
Miki was jogging up the hill.
She found me.
She rushed.
Toward me.
While stumbling.

[Miki]
"Uwaaaaaaan!!!"

She cried.
She leaped into my chest.
I caught her.

[Miki]
"Sempai, Sempai-Sempai-Sempaaaaaai!!!"
[Miki]
"There's no one hereeeeeee!! Something's straaaaaaange! This absolutely isn't normaaaaaaal!!!"

[Taichi]
"......y-yeah."

[Miki]
"No one's in any of the houses! There's hardly anyone left, they've all disappeared!!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's a problem."

I consoled her while patting her back.

[Miki]
"What is all this......this can't happen......"

A small girl.
How much happiness and coincidence and time would I need to raise an invincible Miki?

[Taichi]
"Aren't I here?"

[Miki]
"......uuuuu! Yes......thank goodness......you're here......"
[Miki]
"I woke up this morning, and mom wasn't there, and breakfast wasn't there......when I thought that everyone really had disappeared......"

[Taichi]
"Were you scared?"

She nodded as if to rub her forehead against me.

[Miki]
"I don't like this......I...don't......"

[Taichi]
"It really is lonely without other people."

[Miki]
"......I want to go home......"

[Taichi]
"You want to go home?"

[Miki]
"I wanna go home, I wanna go home......"

[Taichi]
"I see, you want to go home."

[Miki]
"I want to see Kiri-chin......and everyone else......"

I handed her my handkerchief.
It was quickly stained.
Thanks to surface tension, the girl's overflowing tears were like pearls.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, huh?"

One week.
Sunday is everything.

[Miki]
"Egu, egu, egu."

She never stopped crying.
We came to school holding hands.

[Taichi]
"You know, I have some stuff to do, so Miki, what about you?"

[Miki]
"I'll wait for Kiri here."

[Taichi]
"......I see."
[Taichi]
"Well, bye."

[Miki]
"Ah, when you're done with doing things, will you still have things to do?"

She asked while waving her arms.

[Taichi]
"I won't."

[Miki]
"Then, I'll be waiting here......right here......"

[Taichi]
"Why not wait in the classroom?"

[Miki]
"......I don't want to be in a building with no people......I don't think I'd be able to breathe."

[Taichi]
"I understand. Then I'll finish this quickly."

[Miki]
"Ah, your handkerchief......I'll compensate you, with something other than money."

Why?
My sexual harassment soul suddenly welled up.

[Taichi]
"That's fine. I only had that handkerchief because I can't leave a crying girl alone."

[Miki]
......*sob*

Immediate effect.
The classroom.
Kiri's not here.
She's not here anymore.
However many times I repeat, Kiri will never appear again for all eternity.
The very word 'eternity' is nearly a contradiction, but there are no means for Kiri and I to connect to one another.
A natural punishment to be inflicted on me for using those girls to store up provisions in my heart.
Punishment.
Ã—
Cross.
(TL Note: "Batsu" can mean "punishment," but it can also refer to a cross or X used to mean "no" or "incorrect".)
But I can no longer cross with her---

[Taichi]
"But......how can I explain that?"

To Miki.
My head hurts.
I returned to the front gate.
Miki was crouched down with her head between her knees.

[Taichi]
"......Miki, I'm here."

[Miki]
"............Sempai, Kiri won't come."

[Taichi]
"Maybe she's taken the day off."

[Miki]
"Then......she's at home?"

[Taichi]
"Right now? I'm not sure, she might have gone out."

[Miki]
"......I'm going."
