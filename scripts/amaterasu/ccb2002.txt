One nice thing about living in the country: the nights aren't painfully hot.
The wind slipping in through my window felt nice and cold on my skin.
//Why am I only catching these things in copy and pasted text...(rhetorical)-Spin

[Taichi]
"......I'm hungryyyy."

While talking to myself in moderation, I composed a diary entry.
*growlllllllll*
My stomach bug repeated its roar.
Like a lioness who reveals hostility toward her cage, even though that cage is unaware that it's enclosing her.

[Stomach Bug]
『Eat! Eat you bastard! Eat up!』

[Taichi]
"You're annoying. Is that some kind of gag?"

[Stomach Bug]
『I'm hungry! Eat I say! This is a problem for you too!』

[Taichi]
"Short-tempered I see. Go eat your own legs like an octopus from one of Sakutarou Hagiwara's poems. If you eat everything, you can become an eternal existence."

[Stomach Bug]
『Are you mocking me!? Are you looking down on me!?』

[Taichi]
"So what if I am? Nn?"

[Stomach Bug]
『I'll hit you!』

[Taichi]
"Just try it, imaginary figment."

[Stomach Bug]
『Don't make light of me! I'm an unprincipled, sweetly-raised entertainer's son!』

[Taichi]
"Huuu, aren't you cool. But don't forget that your sweet guy persona is a powerless entertainer's son waiting on the death row inside my body."

[Stomach Bug]
『Ooohhh, you've really done it now!』

And that is how a human like me can measure the mutual understanding between myself and a conceptual existence.
Is that what they call mad**ss oh is that so.
Don't sweat it! (crying)

[Taichi]
"Still, I really am hungry."

Should I eat something?
I went downstairs.
The refrigerator's interior had been emptied.
Since there's no power flow, nothing can be preserved here.
I scoured the cabinets.
There was no bread.
There was no jerky.
There were only hopes and dreams.
......those were just so thoroughly useless that I just threw them away.
There was pepper.
There were potatoes.
TAICHI obtained SAUCE.
//A few of these lines have a little beep like the RPG "You got _!" sound, but I haven't played an RPG in so long I don't know which verb would be the ideal match for it, or if I should be putting "sauce" in some kind of brackets. 〜IX
//"Obtained _" is the only one that I would think of (this was written before I checked the next lines, so I guess we're in agreement). - pondrthis
TAICHI obtained SALT.
TAICHI obtained SUGAR.

[Taichi]
"This is a feast!"

I lined them up on the table.

[Taichi]
"Time to eat!"

Dispose......dispose......
With a sound similar to shaving, I gnawed on the raw salted potatoes.

[Taichi]
"Hooo, so this is the taste of new potatoes, nngagugu......nice and hard, almost like rocks......"
[Taichi]
"Wait, I can't eat this! What do you think I am!?"

I threw it.

[Taichi]
"*spit* *spit* I chewed it all the way to the bud! Even though it's poisonous! (that's true)"
//Yeah, potatoes are related to the deadly nightshade (belladonna) plant. Any part of the plant exposed to sunlight (this is one reason why farmers "hill" potatoes) stores a neurotoxin that acts like the opposite of Nicotine (tobacco is also related), causing massive shutdown in the human body. The neurotoxin doesn't build up to very life-threatening levels in potatoes, but it can make you sick. - pondrthis

And then I noticed.

[Taichi]
"There's no food!?"

I was shocked.

[Taichi]
"I know! If there's no bread, I can just eat cake......huhu!"

A nice gag which would unmistakably bring sidesplitting laughter to the starving masses.
Because the masses are just that broad-minded.

[Taichi]
"Actually I'll order pizza."

I picked up the phone.

[Taichi]
"Excuse me, this is Kurosu, I'd like a medium dubchepi......"

*Dubchepi = a real word. A shortening of double cheese pizza. It's really called this.

[Taichi]
"They've been annihilated!"

I fell down in tears.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, and I hadn't even championed their menu yet!!"
//All I can think of is that he's referring to having eaten everything on their menu, so 'conquered their menu'? - Sheeta

My life is full of regrets.

[Taichi]
"That's it! There were potatoes here."

I just have to steam them.
I went out to the garden.
With survival manga as my guide, I prepared the rice cooker.
//"A" made it seem like he had multiple ones.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Finished......"

Steaming them is a pain, so I just cooked them.
This is the simple way to make potato butter:
Light a fire.
Dance.
Heat some stones.
Give each potato a name.
Throw stones at the foil wrapped potatoes while feeling brokenhearted (this increases the flavor).
Wait.
Cry.
Wait.
Wipe your tears.
Wait.
Overcome your sadness and grow as a person.
Wait.
Stop waiting.
Stop your stomach bug.
Take the potatoes out and move them onto a plate.
Butter......in lieu of that, add salt.
Sweep away trivial questions like, 'Wasn't this supposed to be potato butter?'
Eat.

[Taichi]
"Ow-ow-ow."

But they're good.
I feel so alive...
I saw someone collapse near the front door.

[Taichi]
"Bu!"

I ran to her.
It was none other than Kirihara Touko.

[Touko]
"Uuuuuu."

While greedily devouring the potato, I looked down at Touko.
//omg, it's the same picture as the sandwich. This means that she eats in such a cute way EVERYTIME.-Spin

[Touko]
"Uuuuuu."

I devoured the second potato.

[Touko]
"......someone......"

I devoured the third---

[Touko]
"Save me already......"

[Taichi]
"She spoke."

[Touko]
"Uuuu......"

She seemed to be in pain.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Touko]
"......the smell of food......"

[Taichi]
"Hmm. You traced that smell all the way here?"

[Touko]
"............"

She had no reaction.

[Taichi]
"............"

I finished eating the third potato, then pulled Touko's body up.
*gobble* *gobble* *gobble*
Touko greedily devoured the potato.

[Taichi]
"......"

Without any seasonings.
With no time set aside for chewing.
Furiously, dauntlessly, thoroughly, eating.
If I think back, Touko was always embarrassed to eat in front of people.
This is rare behavior.

[Taichi]
"......Shinden."

[Touko]
"......!......!"
(TL Note: "Shinden" = "newly cleared farmland.")

[Taichi]
"......Kasai."

[Touko]
"......!......!"
(TL Note: "Kasai" is a district near Tokyo.)

[Taichi]
"......Ukajin."

[Touko]
"......what are you listing?"
(TL Note: "Ukajin" was a god in Japanese folk religions during the middle ages.)

[Taichi]
"The innocent potato people who've become your flesh and blood."

[Touko]
"Ha?"

With her cheeks stuffed full of potato, Touko made a dubious face.

[Taichi]
"You need not worry about it."
[Taichi]
"Their lives will be carried on."

I clasped my hands in prayer.

[Touko]
"......ha?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing, nothing."
//Not too sure about this but I always hear it this way rather than the other way.-Spin

She looked at me blankly for a while.
Then started gnawing once more.

[Touko]
"......nku!"

Her limbs tightened.

[Taichi]
"Here, water."

I passed her a PET bottle.

[Touko]
"Nn! Nn! Nn!......"

She gulped it down.

[Touko]
"Hafu, hafu."

She devoured again.
This girl tries to look like an adult, but she behaves like a kid......
After flattening seven or eight of them, Touko finally took a breath.
//SEVEN OR EIGHT?!? That makes 10-11 potatoes that he stuffed into a rice cooker.-Spin
//It was "finishing" before, but imo the hyperliteral "flattening" is funnier and still makes sense in English. 〜IX

[Touko]
"......I've calmed down."

[Taichi]
"That's good to hear."

Touko corrected her sitting posture.
With her head hung low, she looked up at me.
And I her.
//This makes it more romantic.-Spin
I stared at her.

[Touko]
"......don't look at me."

She blushed and looked down.
She was cute.
My heart pounded a bit.

[Taichi]
"N-no I wasn't......you did it first, so..."

[Touko]
"I was trying to say thanks!!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, yes, go ahead."

[Touko]
"Nn......"

Once more.

[Touko]
"Th, th, th-"
[Touko]
"......thank...you."

That was awkward.

[Taichi]
"It's fine."
[Taichi]
"I had no idea you were literally starving."

Touko blushed even more.

[Taichi]
"Was there no food in your house?"

[Touko]
"There was, but......"
[Touko]
"I didn't know how to cook any of it..."

[Taichi]
"What?"
[Taichi]
"Didn't you say...you're good at cooking......?"

[Touko]
"I'm sorry......"
[Touko]
"That's...a lie......"

[Taichi]
"You lie!"
//Question mark? As in, "even Touko lies?" For some reason the exclamation point seems like he's calling her confession a lie. - pondrthis

Baaang. (the sound of revelation)

[Touko]
"Sorry."

[Taichi]
"But, didn't you make bentou......?"

[Touko]
"One of my servants made them, but I pretended I did."

Baaang, baaang.

[Taichi]
"That servant......how old was she?"

[Touko]
"Forty-five years......"

Baaang, baaang, baaang.

[Taichi]
"......I got excited......over an oba-chan's...... bentou......"

[Touko]
"I'm sorry......"

[Taichi]
"You're horrible!"

I fell down in tears.
Then,

[Taichi]
"Then why not go home and have some meat or canned food?"

[Touko]
"What's canned food?"

[Taichi]
"Are you serious!!?"

She doesn't know of the existence of canned food!?
She doesn't know the words 'canned food?'
The two words 'canned food' are not listed in the Encyclopedia Touko?
Eh? Well I did know she was rich, but......eh? For real?

[Taichi]
"Isn't caviar a canned food?"

I asked while my body shook.

[Touko]
"It's in a bottle. The box they come in gets sent from some foreign country every week."

They eat that on a daily basis---!?

[Taichi]
"If there's no cake then go eat bread and caviar together you rich bastard!"

[Touko]
"Wh-why are you mad? And what's 'cake'......???"

[Taichi]
"Kyabiii! It's being eaten by this girl who doesn't know anything of the ordinary! Oooh! Oooh!"

I personified and pitied the caviar.

[Touko]
"Even if you cry..."

[Taichi]
"That's why! That's why I'm asking what happened to the proud caviar!"

[Touko]
"There wasn't any this week. It was meant to be delivered yesterday."

[Taichi]
"What about last week?"

[Touko]
"Last week I didn't eat any at all, so the seal was never broken......and since it's perishable, it was thrown away."

[Taichi]
"Go to hell!!!"

I bent over backward.
And fell to the ground.

[Touko]
"Kya!!? What's wrong?"

While maintaining the bridge, my whole body convulsed.

[Taichi]
"Caviar......thrown away......since it's perishable......thrown away before it perishes......"

[Touko]
"You're foaming at the mouth!?"

[Taichi]
"Even though I lost all of my life savings in Chinese stocks when I was a kid......"
[Taichi]
"You've been throwing away caviar!!"

[Touko]
"You're so incoherent I can't begin to-"

[Taichi]
"That's why rich people-!"

Touko hid her face.

[Touko]
"......rich...isn't that meaningless now?"

[Taichi]
"Well that is true."

[Touko]
"Kurosu's fine because he can cook, right?"

[Taichi]
"Not sure about cooking, all I did was roast these."

Anyone can do that.
Though I do hold the power of Saitou Ta**o.
//I have no idea what the guy has to do with cooking. SOS. 〜IX
//He's implying that this guy wrote the survival manga mentioned earlier, I think. - pondrthis

[Touko]
"......this is a pain. To think you have to work just to stay alive."
(TL Note: Saitou Takao is a manga author, most famous for the series Golgo 13.)

A statement of the rich.
This girl's house had servants.
Specifically, maids.
Touko ojou-sama.
In other words, she was automatically kept alive without doing anything herself.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara can't live on her own."

[Touko]
"......-hut up."

A forceless refutation is assent.

[Taichi]
"You automatic girl......"

[Touko]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Touko]
"......can I live here?"

I doubted my ears.
She's really weakening.
I know I've said that before.
But it's true that she has no one else to rely on.
By necessity, she came to me.
Uwa, complicated...
After all, Touko and I---
Uuuuuuuuuu (agonizing).
