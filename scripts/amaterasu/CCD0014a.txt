[Taichi]
"Yo, so you came."

[Touko]
"......pout."

[Taichi]
"......pout."

Then, I poked her chest.
Gu!!!

[Touko]
"........................do you......want to die?"

[Taichi]
"I-it already feels like I'm dying......"

I kissed the ground after one attack.

[Taichi]
"Don't get so mad. I have a present for you."

[Touko]
"I don't need it."

[Taichi]
"Now, now, please say that after you've seen it."
[Taichi]
"I'm sure you'll like it."

[Touko]
"I said I don't need it."

[Taichi]
"I feel bad about a lot of things."

[Touko]
"All lies."

[Taichi]
"I need you, Touko."

[Touko]
"......all lies."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I placed a ring box on top of her desk.

[Touko]
"......!"
[Touko]
"This...is?"

[Taichi]
"My feelings."

She averted her gaze as if embarrassed.

[Taichi]
"Because of the times we're in,"

I rubbed the bottom of my nose.

[Taichi]
"Won't you accept my broken heart?"

[Touko]
"......I......but!"

[Taichi]
"It's okay, don't say anything. My feelings can't be conveyed through words."

[Touko]
"Taichi......are you serious?"

I nodded silently.

[Touko]
"Then......I'll take it......okay?"

She softly picked up the case.

[Touko]
"Can I open it?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. I'll put it on you."

[Touko]
"......no, that's too fancy."

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

[Touko]
"Huhuhu."

And then Touko slowly opened the case.

[Touko]
"......"
[Touko]
"Why are there panties inside a ring case!?"

[Taichi]
"Hogeee!!"

I was punched.

[Touko]
"Aaaaaaa! This guy is just!!! Kiiiiiiiiii!!!"

She tore her hair.

[Taichi]
"Touko, wait."

[Touko]
"What!?"

[Taichi]
"These aren't ordinary panties."

I picked up the fallen underwear.
I stuck my fingers into the crotch.
They passed clean though a slit that originally shouldn't have existed.

[Taichi]
"They're play panties. You can do it without stripping."

I bent my fingers a few times.

[Touko]
"......huhu."

Ah, not good.

[Touko]
"Die with haste, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Gyaaa!"

I was chased throughout the school.
