"Hmm?"

There was a note left on top of the table.
『There might be dinner.』

[Taichi]
"Yaaay, I'm going, I'm going!"

I didn't have to make it myself.
I took three minutes to change, then went to her house without delay.
Dinner was quite delicious.
I lit the candle.
The solitary glimmer shone upon the inside of the room.
I liked candles.
The raw flame captivated me.
The wavering flame captured my soul as I watched it, allowing me to doze on forever and ever.
I once burnt my bangs doing that.
That was just three minutes ago.

[Taichi]
"......it burnt......damn it."

I wanted to cry.
But now for my diary.
I opened up the bulky notebook.
A record of one's life is a precious thing.
I went to school.
Even though all of humanity was gone, everyone showed up.
Since there weren't any classes, we all hung around idly.
Touko was especially harsh today.
Maybe she's getting nervous because she can't fully grasp the situation.
Mimi-sempai had her club on the roof.
She was constructing the abandoned antenna.
It's not something you can simply put aside and come back to once in a while.
It's painful work.
But it's that pain...that saves Sempai.
As I walked down the hallway, Miki was doing some cleaning.
Is Miki doing her cleaning in the same way that Sempai is running her club?
I don't know.
Did I force Miki to wake up to the reality of this critical situation, i.e. humanity's annihilation?
I also got hit by one of Miki's attacks.
This is a grave situation, Mr. Principal!
But seeing my pupil become more skilled does make me happy.
The day she'll surpass her master draws near.
A lot of other stuff happened, too, but overall it was a good day.
