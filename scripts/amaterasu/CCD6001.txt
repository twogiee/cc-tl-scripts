I went to the cafeteria.
Sakuraba had been eating curry bread.
This guy's simple. Piece of cake.
I'll just have to push his body over there on Sunday.

[Taichi]
"Sakurabaaa."

[Sakuraba]
"Nnn?"

[Taichi]
"Come to my house on Sunday morning."

[Sakuraba]
"Understood. I'll be there."

Although I can't just trust him, of course.
I woke up.
Sunlight was penetrating through the window.
I must have been sleeping soundly. I didn't have a single dream.
The time......7 A.M.
I have to go to school.

[Sakuraba]
"Yo."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed him a surgical mask.

[Sakuraba]
"Okay."

He put it on without any questions.

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"You're not eating?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm preparing for first period class."

[Taichi]
"......is eating curry bread your class?"

[Sakuraba]
"Until the day curry bread is no more."

He decided coolly.
Just like the records said.

[Taichi]
"Can't you just eat instant curry?"

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."

Just like the records said.
The records are accomplishing a lot.

[Sakuraba]
*hekkusu!!*

[Taichi]
"......hu, there's the hexagonal tragedy."

This was also in the records.
From what I've confirmed so far, its occurrence rate was above fifteen percent.
Which calculates to being hit with a snot bridge one out of every seven times.
But a great person in the past (me) devised a means of evasion through equipping him with a mask.

[Sakuraba]
"......can I take the mask off?"

[Taichi]
"I cannot allow that."

[Sakuraba]
"Life......is a harsh thing."

[Taichi]
"That's exactly right."
[Taichi]
"I'll go home now."

[Sakuraba]
"......I see."

[Taichi]
"Make sure you come to my house on Sunday morning."

[Sakuraba]
"Understood. Not a problem."

Can I trust him?
Wednesday.
To school.
A gate to prevent running away.
It didn't seem to be protecting the students so much as protecting the outside world from us.
That's the impression it held.

[Taichi]
"Here again?"

[Sakuraba]
"......I've become bored."

[Taichi]
"Indeed."
[Taichi]
"I have one thing to say to you. You, who is covered in a sense of negligence,"
[Taichi]
"Don't go off on a journey."

[Sakuraba]
"Understood."

[Taichi]
"Get my permission first."

[Sakuraba]
"Understood."

[Taichi]
"That instantaneous compliance of yours is what's worrying me! Are you listening!?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's fine. I'll get your permission first."

[Taichi]
"So you do understand."

[Sakuraba]
"Does that go for adventures as well?"

[Taichi]
"It goes for everything!"

[Sakuraba]
"Everything......so expeditions too..."

[Taichi]
"All conduct that involves leaving the town is out."

[Sakuraba]
"Aaah, that makes sense."

Really?

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, I have one question."

[Taichi]
"Aan?"

[Sakuraba]
"You know the kanji written with two men and one woman?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Sakuraba]
"Isn't it stimulating?"

[Taichi]
"......aren't you impotent?"

[Sakuraba]
"Taichiii!"
[Sakuraba]
"Heeey, Taichiii!"

[Taichi]
"What? What?"

[Sakuraba]
"I've decided to go on a journey!"

[Taichi]
"......"

Karade chop to the neck.
Sakuraba collapsed.

[Sakuraba]
"......uuu, on a journey......"

[Taichi]
"You're still saying that?"
[Taichi]
"Journeys are prohibited."

[Sakuraba]
"That's pretty harsh......"

[Taichi]
"Prohibited until next week."

[Sakuraba]
"They'll be fine next week?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, they're okay from next week on. Just a few more days of perseverance."

[Sakuraba]
"I see......okay, understood."

[Taichi]
"You're a spontaneous guy. You said nothing about this yesterday."

[Sakuraba]
"Please listen."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Sakuraba]
"I've grown bored of curry bread."

[Taichi]
"......you know..."

[Sakuraba]
"They no longer stimulate me enough. I'm going to go and search for something more interesting."

[Taichi]
"I have a feeling that the blood of fairies runs in your veins."

[Sakuraba]
"Besides, I might find some people out there."

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

So it's not that he isn't thinking about it.

[Sakuraba]
"Right, right, I was thinking I'd give back the money I borrowed from you."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, it does feel like you borrowed some......"

[Sakuraba]
"How much was it?"

Even though there's no longer any meaning in money.
Strange guy.

[Taichi]
"Well...I don't remember the amount..."

[Sakuraba]
"For now, I'll hand you my pocket change."

He took out his wallet.

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

[Sakuraba]
"Please use that to pay off whatever was left."

He took a wooden box out of his baggage.

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's okay......please bring that back with you."

[Sakuraba]
"Are you sure? I think it's worth some money."

[Taichi]
"You can't do that. You need to donate it to a history museum somewhere."

[Sakuraba]
"......?"
[Sakuraba]
"Hey, about my journey next week,"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, what is it?"

[Sakuraba]
"Would you come with me?"

[Taichi]
"......me? On a journey?"

[Sakuraba]
"What'll it be?"

[Taichi]
"......it sounds fun."

Next week.

[Taichi]
"Sure, I'll go with you."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay, we'll both become hawks."

[Taichi]
"Well, please make it a sparrow or a kite."

[Sakuraba]
"Then, I'll be going on my journey soon."

[Taichi]
"Wait up!"
[Taichi]
"Didn't I just tell you to stay here until Sunday!?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, sorry, I forgot."

Too dangerous.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba, you're under arrest."

[Sakuraba]
"......what?"

[Taichi]
"An immediate arrest, with no warrant."

[Sakuraba]
"Immediate!?"

[Taichi]
"That's right. So live here until Sunday."

[Sakuraba]
"Muu......"

[Taichi]
"And now I shall give you the pitiful second name of Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"Seriously? Isn't that too cool? It's decided."

Too pitiful.
I subdued Sakuraba.
And then, morning---
I woke up.

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"Sakuraba, we're going."

[Sakuraba]
"Aaah......what about breakfast?"

[Taichi]
"We'll eat when we get there."

[Sakuraba]
"Understood......"

[Taichi]
"Let's go."

[Sakuraba]
"......where are we heading to?"

[Taichi]
"To a picnic."

[Sakuraba]
"This is quite an incompetent picnic."

[Taichi]
"Yep. That is the true concept."

[Sakuraba]
"I'll go on a journey next week."

[Taichi]
"Please go, please go."

Okay.
I brought Sakuraba to that place.

[Taichi]
"Hold this."

[Sakuraba]
"What's this? A radio?"

[Taichi]
"I figure it'll be a good indicator."
[Taichi]
"......so, walk straight ahead here."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"Slowly!"

[Sakuraba]
"Here?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's good. Straight ahead......stop there."

Right in my line of fire.
Now there should only be a few minutes left.
This one came down to the wire.

[Sakuraba]
"......hey, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Sakuraba]
"Why are we doing this?"

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"Why...well, there isn't any real meaning to it."

[Sakuraba]
"......there probably is a meaning."
[Sakuraba]
"Because you've got those eyes."

[Taichi]
"......you...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Aren't we friends?"

[Taichi]
"Fr-......!!?"

What was this guy saying!?
I lost any words I had left.
This is the 21st century, you know.

[Sakuraba]
"Is this the end of our 'hanging out?'"

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba......you..."

[Sakuraba]
"That's a lonely thing."
[Sakuraba]
"If you don't like me, then it can't be helped."

[Taichi]
"......no, Sakuraba, that's not it."

[Sakuraba]
"A lot of strange things have been happening lately."
[Sakuraba]
"The people disappeared......"

The sky darkened.

[Sakuraba]
"......evening comes suddenly."

There's no time.
I have to send him back.
But...
I can't look at this stupid face again---
Even though that's all there is to it...

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba......"

[Sakuraba]
"But the most shocking thing is, that even though you're being chased into a corner, you can't do anything."

[Taichi]
"You idiot."
[Taichi]
"Think only about yourself. It's a hundred years too early for you to worry about anyone else. Sakuraba's in no position to say anything serious."

[Sakuraba]
"......this is what you were like back then."

[Taichi]
"Wh---"

[Sakuraba]
"It seems like you've been pushing yourself a lot lately."
[Sakuraba]
"That takes me back."

[Taichi]
"......!"

Who I was a long time ago.
Making me remember that at this time...

[Taichi]
"......just go, you idiot."

*click*---
I 『observed』.
I closed my eyes, and opened them---

[Sakuraba]
"......Taichi?"
[Sakuraba]
"......nn......a broadcast?"
[Sakuraba]
"Taichi? The radio's......"
[Sakuraba]
"........................"
[Sakuraba]
"......I see."
[Sakuraba]
"So that's it."

I returned the 『discrepancy』 called Sakuraba to normal.

[Taichi]
"Seriously..."

My friend?
Who would say such a thing at a time like this?
Who I ask......

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

Comically,

[Taichi]
"Hahaha, haha."

I couldn't stop laughing.
But,
However much I laughed,
My vision didn't blur---
That's why, Sakuraba.
This was for the best.
I won't see that guy again.
The memories I'd stored up were all that Sakuraba was to me.

[Taichi]
"......iiidiot."

I became strangely afraid and held my shaking knees.
I looked down and closed my eyes.
Red invaded through my eyelids.
And then, the world revolved again---
