[Taichi]
"Anyway, what about the club?"

[Misato]
"......well..."

Sempai stared at me intensely.

[Misato]
"Did you come here to help?"

[Taichi]
"Yes!"

[Misato]
"Is that so...?"

Her quiet, hardened gaze wouldn't waver.
Finally, Sempai's face formed a soft smile.

[Misato]
"Thank you very much, Peke-kun."

[Taichi]
"Do not thank me. It is merely my duty as a soldier of the empire."

I saluted.
She chuckled.

[Misato]
"But unfortunately, it's already nighttime."
[Misato]
"The time for fun club activities is over!"

[Taichi]
"Eeeh?"

[Misato]
"I'm sorry. I decided to do this all on my own, and then I let the time run away."

[Taichi]
"But can you really finish on your own? Especially with the wiring and such."
[Taichi]
"Come to think of it, the power supply-"

[Misato]
"It's fine."
[Misato]
"Women are courageous."

[Taichi]
"Then men are amorous."
[Taichi]
"Sempai, I'm..., I'm..."

As I edged closer to her,

[Misato]
"Club iiis oveeer!!"

[Taichi]
"Gufuu-"

With my face shoved by her hand, I became even uglier.
And when I said, 『Gufuu,』 I felt like I'd just sunk to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.

[Misato]
"Now, let's go home! Unfortunately, our houses are in opposite directions, hohohoho."

[Taichi]
"......shouldn't you be unsatisfied with this?"

[Misato]
"Why? We had a lot of fun today, didn't we?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, I wonder about that..."

[Misato]
"When you had your face buried in my chest, weren't you touching my butt?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"I'm amazed how hard you were squeezing."
[Misato]
"And with both hands."

[Taichi]
"............"

[Misato]
"It really tickled."

[Taichi]
"♪♪"

I whistled in the direction of the day after tomorrow.

[Misato]
"You are, after all, a b-o-y."

She rubbed her fist all over my temple.
That hurt.
There was no chance of tricking her into stopping.

[Taichi]
"Uuu......I'm sorry......"

[Misato]
"Then again, that also means,"
[Misato]
"I have at least that much value as a woman."
[Misato]
"That, or Peke-kun has low standards."

[Taichi]
"Nonono, I may be a komusou, but I have standards!"
[Taichi]
"I can't believe you even thought of lumping me in with them!!"

As I desperately tried to distract her, I threw out lame emergency gags.

[Misato]
"Huhuhu."

Sempai tilted her head up to the dense, orange backdrop of the evening sky.

[Misato]
"I'll forgive you, so go home and think about what you did."
[Misato]
"This is goodbye, Peke-kun."

As I left the school building, I looked up at the roof.
The antenna was standing there.
Beside it,
Sempai still remained.
She'd been working.
Even though it's almost night.
By herself.
This was the first time I realized it.
Sempai had always been gently rejecting anyone who offered her help.
