And then, Sunday.
The roof.
All the preparations had been made.
......but it wasn't meant to be.
The antenna had been destroyed.
There are only 『eight people,』 and yet...
She was at the base of the destroyed spire.
There she was crouched down.
I tried to put my hand on her shoulder, but she dodged it.
Tomoki and Sakuraba arrived.
Touko arrived.
Sakuraba punched Tomoki.
Tomoki's mouth looked unnaturally bent because of it.
The door opened with an ill omen, and Kiri and Miki came out.
Kiri possessed the power to cause bloodshed.
After that, there was only falling down.
The truth was made red.
Betrayed bonds.
A fragile unity more ephemeral than a vision.
Wrong.
Wrong, wrong, wrong.
I hadn't anticipated a breaking off.
Touko died.
Noise heightened.
Kiri directed animosity toward me.
For a moment, I wanted to kill Kiri.
Okay, it's over---
//If it's not already obvious, you probably should be looking at these background or editing in-game due to the extremely rapid changes above and a few rather unexpected ones below. 〜IX
I ran down the hallway.
The noise of students.
Countless footsteps.
The sound of a door opening.
The sound of a bell.
Silence.
Silently.
There shouldn't be any communication.

[Youko]
"I think Taichi lived well."
[Youko]
"You've continued to search for the possibility dozens, hundreds and thousands of times."
[Youko]
"But within them, there wasn't a single one of the happy ends that Taichi desired."
[Youko]
"None of them could be called anything but bad ends."
[Youko]
"Nothing but bad ends."
[Youko]
"......you understand now, don't you?"

[Taichi]
"............"

She began following me, along with the smell of blood.

[Taichi]
"Why did you kill them?"

[Youko]
"......I'm the only one for you."
[Youko]
"I wanted you to know that."
[Youko]
"Let's end this already."
[Youko]
"We should live together now."

[Taichi]
"I...can't do that......"

[Youko]
"I see."
[Youko]
"Then, I'll wait, however many times it takes."

My days in the mansion had been immersed in dark impurity.
My form reflected in the window was that of a girl.
Obviously.
Because I was cross-dressing.
I had a roommate.
Hasekura Youko.
It was her.
And during the night events, we were favored.
It was a good place for child abuse.
But that wasn't it.
The excuse was that Youko-chan and I were under their protection.
Every night, we were hurt by the speartip of the animal passions people possessed.
Every day, every day.
There were people being hurt, and people hurting them.
And then we saw the end of someone being hurt.
A husband and wife torn apart.
We could only endure it.
We only expected to live through it.
We lived, with our entire hearts and bodies covered in wounds.
And then, the contract.
An alliance to live carved into our hearts.
With just that vow, we had enough strength to live.
If only that man hadn't come---
The outrages became more radical.
We devised a plan.
The battle strength of two children.
And knowledge of the land.
The important part was to get them all in one fell swoop.
They numbered too many for us to defeat individually.
We needed an equation to make the impossible possible.
We made time, prepared tools, trained, observed, altered, investigated, deferred, purchased, revised, searched, decided, withdrew and kissed.
We were going to grant them ruin, equal to the cost of all the dignity they'd stolen.
//Not too sure, but the other way just didn't flow right off the tip of your tongue when reading it.-Spin
I also disposed of her chastity before it was stolen by them.
We were one mind and body, siblings, connected people.
Our mutual correspondence had no fraternization.
It truly was disposal.
Even as the plan stagnated, we steadily framed it.
And then, the day we carried it out.
Fourteen dead.
The children became beasts.
//lol, I like how Kiri is on the ground with her crossbow still.-Spin
And then......we were released.
As victims.
Yes, as a tender boy and girl.
A pitiful sacrifice.
The culprit......

[Taichi]
"A really huge......and bald......man. That's who it was."

The monstrously thrilling case was confined in a deep, dark labyrinth.
Society always maintained it at a fixed temperature.
Why did I come here?
Last Sunday, on the way back from the campout, I walked by this way, but I'd never once come here.
//Should be more clear that he was only in the general area but not in that exact spot before.-Spin
I want to return.
That's right, I want to flee.
From this world with no one in it.
From this massacred world.
Because, we...
I pushed through the grass.
Because I passed through here.
Would 'passed through' be misleading?
All I did was squint my eyes.
At that time...
The campout I'd forcefully arranged ended in failure, and everyone was walking with frigid feelings.
A summer break far longer than the general education institution consumed our last few days.
Everyone must have been feeling bitter.
So was I.
I took the lead as if fleeing.
I wanted to flee.
From that which my eyes captured.
I instinctively felt an emptiness on the other side.
At the time I momentarily thought about becoming alone.
I squinted my eyes.
When I did, the world shifted like an optical illusion.

[Taichi]
"......"

I am one who observes two worlds.
And then, I came to know that the world was far more absurd and nonsensical than I'd ever thought.
I was struck by frustration, and kicked the hokora.
The door opened from the shock.
Even for a prankster like me, this was the first time I'd ever opened it.
I peeked inside.
I was shocked.

[Taichi]
"What...is this......?"

In there were piled up,
Stacks of notebooks reaching up to the ceiling.

[Taichi]
"This is......?"

University notebooks had been shoved in here until there was no more room.
I felt a faint coldness, and tried pulling out one of them.
I was shocked.
Isn't this my handwriting?
Aren't they all mine!?

[Taichi]
"This one too......ah, and this one......"

Even though I have no memory of writing them...
I followed my handwriting.
One notebook......two notebooks......
Confusion swelled up as I continued reading.
Seven notebooks......eight notebooks......
My doubt surpassed a certain point and within moments formed an organic combination with my brain.

[Taichi]
"......we're......repeating?"

And, while I was loving someone, bringing them back and reconciling with them......I desired a blessed conclusion of a fixed probability with everyone in unity.
The world will end after one week.
Just that little time.
Since I know we're repeating, and being reset---
Friendship, bonds, unity.
The word for it doesn't matter.
I desired 『that.』
The result......is a cruel thing.
A happy end that shouldn't exist.

[Nanaka]
"......Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka......?"

The girl I met at the start of the week.
But her existence is shown by the notebooks.

[Nanaka]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"......what is this......?"
[Taichi]
"What kind of situation is this?"
[Taichi]
"......everyone......died......"
[Taichi]
"But, soon all of it won't have happened, and we're just going to repeat it from the top?"
[Taichi]
"What the hell is that!?"
[Taichi]
"Far too many attempts to count......"

Just the number of notebooks in the pile...no, if we include the unrecorded possibilities, it'd be several times this many.

[Taichi]
"Is this it?"

I stuck out my palm, with blood still stuck to it.

[Taichi]
"Is this the only ending there is!!?"
[Taichi]
"Isn't there......a slightly better...... conclusion?"
[Taichi]
"How many times have I repeated this?"
[Taichi]
"How many times will I repeat it?"
[Taichi]
"Just how many mistakes do I have to make!?"
[Taichi]
"How many times...do I have to pass through this destruction......to reach..."
[Taichi]
"......how many times......will everyone......"

I hit the trunk of a tree.

[Taichi]
"Even though I needed everyone!"
[Taichi]
"......have I ever once ended in a happy way?"
[Taichi]
"Answer me. You know, right? You've got some amazing power, don't you?"
[Taichi]
"Aren't you the boss of this world!!?"

I glared at her.
The girl avoided my gaze with a sad face.

[Nanaka]
"Taichi......"

[Taichi]
"Answer me."

[Nanaka]
"Hey, does it really have to be a happy end?"
[Nanaka]
"Going out with someone individually, and becoming happy."
[Nanaka]
"Playing with friends."
[Nanaka]
"It's okay to keep on playing here forever."
[Nanaka]
"In this world where you can redo anything, I think Taichi could live without stress."
[Nanaka]
"Wouldn't that be nice?"
[Nanaka]
"Or is that something you can't do?"
[Nanaka]
"I'm here too, after all."
[Nanaka]
"Is it?"

[Taichi]
"......the other side of that happiness is that there's a possibility I'll hurt everyone."
[Taichi]
"There are times she does poorly, thinking I won't do it."
[Taichi]
"A happy week and an unhappy week are equally probable."
[Taichi]
"The two sides are like one; there are both disasters and blessings."
[Taichi]
"Any number of blessings is fine. But sins......"

I pulled down a pile of notebooks.
They broke down like dominoes and covered part of the ground.

[Taichi]
"The sins will be recorded here for eternity, right?"
[Taichi]
"Knowing that......how can I live without stress......?"
[Taichi]
"What's nice about that?"
[Taichi]
"......this is......hell."

[Nanaka]
"......Taichi."

[Taichi]
"What's fun about hurting your friends?"
[Taichi]
"Why do I always leap out when I need to hold myself back!?"
[Taichi]
"What part of me is noble!?"
[Taichi]
"If you say that the world is being reset, then why are the sins I've committed up to now being recorded here!!?"
[Taichi]
"What Yutaka did to me will never become fiction."
[Taichi]
"Sins continue to exist forever, you know."
[Taichi]
"And then, as long as there are people, my sins will keep increasing."
[Taichi]
"That's why I wanted to go away somewhere on the way home from the campout."
[Taichi]
"I wanted to go to a place with only me."
[Taichi]
"......why was everyone else mixed into that?"

[Nanaka]
"About that, Taichi..."

A face of sympathy.

[Nanaka]
"That's because......Taichi looked at everyone."

[Taichi]
"......what did you say?"

[Nanaka]
"Taichi, when you were pulled in here, didn't you look at everyone?"
[Nanaka]
"......afraid of becoming alone, you looked behind you, didn't you?"
[Nanaka]
"Taichi observed everyone, and pulled them in here."

[Taichi]
"I...did that......?"

[Nanaka]
"Didn't you say it too?"
[Nanaka]
"That you need other people."

[Taichi]
"In order to hurt them?"

[Nanaka]
"No, not that."
[Nanaka]
"In order to remain yourself---"

[Taichi]
"I...hate myself......"

[Nanaka]
"Don't say that, you idiot!"

She hit me.
I didn't feel any impact at all, but my heart shook. Faintly.

[Nanaka]
"Idiot, idiot......"

She hit my chest several times.

[Taichi]
"......sorry."

With both her fists lying on my chest, Nanaka said,

[Nanaka]
"You certainly are raising something scary in your heart."
[Nanaka]
"Humans aren't noble after all."
[Nanaka]
"And the world isn't beautiful."
[Nanaka]
"But, doesn't Taichi have just one beautiful thing?"

[Taichi]
"......I don't have anything. I'm just black. My heart specializes in hurting people; it isn't beautiful at all."
//lol, 4chan is going to have a field day with the whole "black" and "hurting people" thing.-Spin

[Nanaka]
"But that Taichi is getting flustered like any normal person would."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Nanaka]
"You want to have healthy dreams, and imitate them......without thinking anything, or hurting anyone, just living on. That's what I think."

[Taichi]
"I'm only thinking that."

[Nanaka]
"But, that's an asset."
[Nanaka]
"Be a little proud of it."

[Taichi]
"......I......I..."

[Nanaka]
"It's fine if you continue living in this one week forever."

Her kind words echoed in my chest.
No, it's like...
It was as if her voice was being produced from inside my chest.
Something felt nostalgic.

[Taichi]
"......no."

I shook my head.

[Taichi]
"......I'll send them back."

[Nanaka]
"Back............?"

[Taichi]
"I can return everyone to their former world......can't I?"

[Nanaka]
"Taichi......that's......"

[Taichi]
"I think I can. I remembered."
[Taichi]
"How should I put it......that place......"
[Taichi]
"I think that place is a much easier place to observe at."
[Taichi]
"It still has this image like a shining crevice."
[Taichi]
"Though only I can see it."
[Taichi]
"If I'm in that place, I might just be able to send them back home."
[Taichi]
"By observing them."

[Nanaka]
"Wait, wait a minute!"
[Nanaka]
"......you're going to be alone!!?"

Grievous.
On the other hand, I'm horribly calm.

[Taichi]
"That's...okay."

Nanaka seemed to have lost her words.

[Taichi]
"The name of the broadcasting channel is Cross Channel after all."
[Taichi]
"Because I'm Kurosu."
[Taichi]
"It's a stupid pun, but..."
[Taichi]
"Isn't communication a technique that exists because we want to connect with others?"
//Told you, Raide.-Spin
//If you refuse to "connect with others", the entire purpose of communication falls apart, Spin. - Raide
[Taichi]
"Phones, wireless, radios, televisions, e-mail, cell phones, conversations, letters."
[Taichi]
"We can't become one with another. But we can temporarily cross and feel each other."
[Taichi]
"That's what humans are."
[Taichi]
"It means their channels are crossing. That's also......"
[Taichi]
"An exchange of hearts."
[Taichi]
"You're incredibly sensible. Thanks to that, I finally understand."
[Taichi]
"I can't cross with anyone---"

[Nanaka]
"......"

When I held her, I had a reassuring feeling similar to taking a nap in the sunshine.
//I'm somewhat sure this will get across the same message without sounding as funky.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Nanaka......?"

[Nanaka]
"I'm sorry......that's all I can leave you with......"

Leave me with?
What did she just say?

[Taichi]
"Leave what?"

But she's no longer here.

[Taichi]
"Eh?......Nanaka?"
[Taichi]
"Nanakaaaa!!"

No presence.
She seems to have disappeared perfectly.
A wry smile.

[Taichi]
"......you're telling me to do it myself."

I returned the notebooks to the hokora.

[Taichi]
"There's no space for me to enter......"

That's right.
There are the notebooks from the past.
That shows that this hokora is exempt from the time rules.
It must not be a coincidence that the gate and the hokora are close together.
In that case,
I'll sit down behind the hokora.
And---

[Taichi]
"!?"

Why's it suddenly evening?

[Taichi]
"What......is this?"

I looked up at the sky.
An increasing density of scarlet.
A deep malicious red was synchronizing with the blood-colored world.

[Taichi]
"......uu......"

I felt dizzy.
Horribly...dizzy...
I closed my eyes.
My semicircular canals were shaking, as if I'd just gotten off the coffee cups at an amusement park.
//Reference to aural anatomy. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"Aaa............"

And then, the world darkened.
........................
............
......
When I woke up, the peculiarly cold morning atmosphere pierced my skin.

[Taichi]
"This is......"

I climbed up the mountain path.
To a location I could survey from.

[Taichi]
"No sign of people......"

I have to confirm what day of the week today is.
I went down the mountain.
........................

[Taichi]
"Ha! Ha!......"

I flew into the Tasaki Shop.
I should be able to confirm the date here.

[Taichi]
"......September......7th."

That was on the memo most recently put up.
No, that's still not proof.
I flew into the classroom.
At the same time, I lost my words.
The window seat.
The girl was resting her chin on her hand. She gave me a single glance.

[Touko]
"......"

With no words, her line of sight moved back outside.
I had no words for her.

[Taichi]
"You're alive......"

I covered my eyes.
The girl who, in my memories......died yesterday.

[Taichi]
"Aaah!......"

I fell to my knees and left my whole body to the numbness coming from my emotions.
Touko faced me as if looking at something queer.

[Taichi]
"See you later."

I waved to her with a queerly forced smile, and left the classroom.

[Taichi]
"......it's Monday."

I've returned.
I've returned as myself.
I climbed the mountain once again.
I peeked into the right place, but the sense of conjunction had disappeared.

[Taichi]
"Nn......it's gone?"

That can't be.
I hurriedly searched the surroundings.

[Taichi]
"......that's it."

I was filled with understanding.

[Taichi]
"It can only connect at a specific time."

Regardless of the logic, I had to assume that.
In any event, I'll be able to tell on the weekend.
If I can't figure it out, I can just spend another week investigating it.
I took the notebooks out of the hokora.
I'll investigate.
What's going on in this world.
I'll study it.
If there is no flawless happiness, that's just fine.
Having everyone get along was no more than my wish.
When contacting any individual person, there were ways to attain an optimal result.
That will be how I make my living.
Memories live on in my heart.
I can explain it in a single sentence.
I wished.
For a paradise where no one had to be hurt.
Mutsumi-san, I'm going to try and obtain that.
And then,
And then,
And then---
