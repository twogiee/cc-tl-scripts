"May I help you with your cleaning?"

[Miki]
"So you're in nice mode now."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Miki]
"Sempai is equipped with two settings: sexual harassment mode and nice mode. Eh-hehri."

My being nice to her also made her stick out her hopelessly flat chest.

[Taichi]
"Mu......"

[Miki]
"Ah, you're embarrassed."

[Taichi]
"No I'm not!!"

[Miki]
"You're embarrassed about your innocent side."

[Taichi]
"Let's focus on cleaning. Hurry, there's no time!"

[Miki]
"Yeees."

I picked up the mop I'd blocked earlier and moved to the nearest stain.
It was blood.

[Taichi]
"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!??"

[Miki]
"Eh!?"

[Taichi]
"Blood, isn't this blood!?"

I can't look at it directly.
I hid my face behind the mop.

[Taichi]
"Get rid of it, now!!"

[Miki]
"Yes yes, please wait a moment."

In no time at all,

[Miki]
"Okay, all done."

[Taichi]
"Is it clean?"

[Miki]
"It's all right."

I moved the mop out of the way.

[Taichi]
"Uuu, I'm weak against blood."

[Miki]
"So you do have a cute side to you."

[Taichi]
"Seriously, it's not easy."

Just seeing it out of the corner of my eye can make me sick.

[Taichi]
"Sorry for being useless."
[Taichi]
"Please revile me as you would a pig......"

[Miki]
"Eh......?"

[Taichi]
"Please, somehow."

[Miki]
"......then,"
[Miki]
"Pigs go to the pigpen?"

[Taichi]
"Gu."

With that phrasing, the interrogative form made it strangely harsher.

[Miki]
"Wouldn't it be better to go to the health room?"

[Taichi]
"No, I feel fine."

[Miki]
"......hmmm."

[Taichi]
"I said I'm fine."

[Miki]
"Why don't we both take a nap there?"

[Taichi]
"Gu......"

That proposal was too hard to resist.

[Miki]
"They've got at least two beds there."

[Taichi]
"See you later."

[Miki]
"Huh......?"
