Wednesday.
Newton bursts out laughing as I obey the laws of inertia by going to school.
//I love lines like this. 〜IX
I walked over the hills.
The gradients are always tough.
My walking slows down.
I finally came to a flat place.

[Taichi]
"......!"

Roasted by a hunch, my consciousness heated up.
//Have fun with this one. 〜IX
//I like it the way it is lol - Sheeta
//I would like to change it but if Sheeta really thinks it looks good then I'll leave it unless told otherwise.-Spin
My body moved faster than my rationality.
I turned around!

[Taichi]
"............not here?"

But I felt someone's presence.
That's it......it's Nanaka.
After I went to the hokora, she hasn't shown herself once.
She knows what's happening to this world.
So why aren't I searching for Nanaka?
Probably......because I won't find her.
I'll never find Nanaka. Never.
I just had that feeling.
