Touko's house.
No......her mansion.
When I entered her mansion, the darkness was unbroken.
The windows were shut tight.
I took out a flashlight and headed for Touko's room.
I came here a number of times a long time ago.
I was almost introduced to her father.
......though I ran away.
The second floor.
I confirmed each of the rooms one by one.
I'm sure it was around here......
Then, when I opened one of the countless doors,
Light poured in.

[Taichi]
"........................"

The window was open all the way.
The wind came in softly, revolved around the room and left.
So that's why...
There's no smell.

[Taichi]
"......Touko."

There was a blade in her chest.
I see, that's definitely a murder victim.
That blade is probably something that came from this mansion.
It was a decorative short sword with a gaudily engraved handle.
There was blood.
It had poured from her chest onto the sheets, and changed to a reddish black color.
However,
It was a beautiful body.
I felt that it was a noble corpse, befitting of Touko.

[Taichi]
"............"

I stayed there for a while.
Had time itself been shot through, along with my heart?
//Since it's impossible to say exactly what this is intended to mean, feel free to change it to "shot through the heart?" 〜IX
It was almost as if Touko had stopped.
If I pulled out the short sword, she might wake up right now and impolitely revile me.
That's how I felt.
......who'd killed her?
Unfortunately, the suspects can be counted on one hand.
Kiri.
Miki.
Tomoki.
Sakuraba.
//Meant to be put together like that?-Spin
Mimi-sempai.
If there were any other humans hiding somewhere, it'd be different, but that's everyone.
First, Kiri.
I don't think it's her.
She was the first to find it, but,
It's hard to think she did it.
Kiri's anger was the real thing, and her confusion was also the truth.
Miki.
There's a possibility.
But I don't know what her motive would be.
At this point alibis are meaningless, since I have no way of knowing for certain what Miki was doing where and when.
I feel sorry for her, but she's Suspect #1.
Tomoki.
He's Suspect #2.
Again the motive is unclear.
Sakuraba.
Suspect #3. Same as above.
Mimi-sempai.
Suspect #4. Same as above.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

There aren't that many clues.
I'm not seeing any likely people or motives.
There's not even a guarantee that the person who killed Youko-chan is the same as the one who killed Touko.
......being a detective is hard.
Around the front gate, I found Suspect #2.
I began Surprise Attack Questioning.
//It sounded like an attack name, so I capitalised it - Sheeta

[Taichi]
"Your age?"

[Tomoki]
"......I can't say."

Just what I'd expect from Tomoki.
He seemed unfazed by my surprise attack.

[Taichi]
"You say you can't tell me your age? Why not?"

[Tomoki]
"I can't say the reason."

[Taichi]
"You can't say the reason?"

[Tomoki]
"Yes......I'm sorry."

[Taichi]
"I'll change my question. Are you older, or younger than twenty?"

[Tomoki]
"Younger?"

[Taichi]
"Are you younger than eighteen?"

[Tomoki]
"I can't say."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm. Are you seventeen?"

[Tomoki]
"I absolutely can't say."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you a high school student?"

[Tomoki]
"......no such thing exists in this world."

[Taichi]
"Which is wrong: girl high student, or girl school student?"

[Tomoki]
"I've heard they're both wrong."
//That was a damn hard one to explain. Tell me if I got it right. 〜IX
(TL Note: Each spelled with one of the two identically pronounced kanji that make up the word "koukou (high school)".)

[Taichi]
"Might you know of something called the student handbook?"
(TL Note: You're still technically supposed to use both kanji in words like that.))

[Tomoki]
"......no such thing exists in this world."

[Taichi]
"Your age?"

[Tomoki]
"Pubescent."

[Taichi]
"......I can't even confirm your age."
//This one could sorta go both ways but it seems better with just the period. It's really hard to tell without the voice.-Spin

[Tomoki]
"What am I supposed to do about it?"

Questioning is hopeless. This can't be done.

[Taichi]
"So, what's up?"

[Tomoki]
"......nothing really. I just thought I'd go home."

[Taichi]
"Weren't you just standing here? You seemed to be receiving some telepathic message."

[Tomoki]
"......I'm going home. I was trying to go home."

Tomoki left simmering.

[Taichi]
"What's with him?"

My eyes followed him from the place he'd been standing.
The roof.
The antenna.
And then,
Mimi-sempai---
She seemed to be clinging to the fence as she gazed at the town.
After a while, she moved away and disappeared beside the antenna.

[Taichi]
"?"

Those two were fighting, weren't they?
It was hard to think they could kill someone while that was going on.
Miki came out of the bathroom.

[Miki]
"Ah, Sempaaai."

[Taichi]
"Yo! Suspect #2."
//Stop changing this. It's 2 in the original. 〜IX

[Miki]
"......EH?"

[Taichi]
"Your age?"

[Miki]
"I can't say."

[Taichi]
"You say you can't tell me your age? Why not?"

[Miki]
"I can't say the reason."

[Taichi]
"Hmph. Then I'll change my question. Are you older, or younger than twenty?"

[Miki]
"I'm younger."

[Taichi]
"Are you younger than eighteen?"

[Miki]
"I've been told I look about fifteen on the outside."

[Taichi]
"Who told you to say something subjective?"

[Miki]
"Yes, I'm sorry."

[Taichi]
"Are you younger than eighteen?"

[Miki]
"I have no choice. I'll tell you the truth......uu! My stomach suddenly hurts."

[Taichi]
"Shit! What horrible timing!"
[Taichi]
"Please tell me in your final moments. Are you not a high school student who's either a girl high student or girl school student with a school notebook?"

[Miki]
"Those four phrases don't exist in this world."

[Taichi]
"I see......then, will you tell me your age?"

[Miki]
"Ten thousand and fifteen."

[Taichi]
"Are you a tree?"

Kiri came out of the bathroom.
//Having "late" would imply that there was a certain time limit to where it was punctual for her entrance right?-Spin

[Kiri]
"Kurosu Taichi!"

She immediately turned up her eyes.

[Kiri]
"Miki, you mustn't talk to that person!"

[Miki]
"Eeeh? But...?"

[Kiri]
"Because he's dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Are you still saying such things?"
[Taichi]
"I saw Touko. She definitely died."

[Kiri]
"......shameless."

[Taichi]
"A friend of yours died. Shouldn't you have wanted to hold her in your arms before considering revenge?"

[Kiri]
"That......g-goes without saying......"

......though that wasn't something I should be saying.

[Miki]
"So then, the culprit is......"

[Taichi]
"All of us are suspects."

[Miki]
"......what should we do?"

[Taichi]
"Isn't it best for all of us to be in one place?"

[Kiri]
"No!"

[Taichi]
"......I thought so."

[Kiri]
"I'll be with Miki! You can go do whatever you want by yourself. After all......you are the culprit."

[Taichi]
"......you can stop that now."

[Kiri]
"Please don't come near Miki."

[Taichi]
"......nnn."
[Taichi]
"Why must you promise Kiri so much?"

[Miki]
"Aaah, not agaaain......"

[Taichi]
"I'll talk to whoever I want to. How the person reacts is up to them."

[Kiri]
"......don't talk to Miki."

[Taichi]
"Is that something for Kiri to decide?"

[Kiri]
"Yes, because......Miki is my first close friend."
[Kiri]
"......I won't allow anyone to be victimized in front of me."

[Taichi]
"I'm telling you I won't eat her."

[Kiri]
"I've always...been harassed......because of that exam score......"

She teared up.
Uhee......
I was disappointed.

[Taichi]
"You're making that my fault......?"

[Kiri]
"That's why......I'm going to......I'm going to protect my friend!"

[Taichi]
"......'kay."

Kiri's beyond help.
In many ways.

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, it's all right. You're making everything out to be Sempai's fault, but what if the culprit turns out to be someone else?"

[Kiri]
"......that won't happen."

[Miki]
"Can you just decide that?"

[Taichi]
"You can't, right?"

[Miki]
"Riiight?"

Miki and I go well together.

[Taichi]
"For now, I'll act on the theory that it's Sakuraba or Tomoki."

[Miki]
"Male friendship is great."

[Taichi]
"Doesn't that compliment just embarrass me?"
[Taichi]
"......b-but if Mimi-sempai did it......she'd have to atone for her s-s-s-sins. With that sinful body."

[Miki]
"Kyan♪"

[Kiri]
"......stop it......"

[Taichi]
"You be careful as well. If one of you did it......appropriate erotic things will happen."

I smoked a fictional cigar.

[Kiri]
"Stop that!!"

[Taichi]
"......eh?"

[Kiri]
"Why do you keep acting so friendly!!!?"

*silence*......
//Those dots, are they supposed to be be there?-Spin

[Kiri]
"Even though-! Even though you're dangerous!!"

[Miki]
"No......Kiri-chin, you don't have to be that wary of him..."

[Taichi]
"I got the feeling I shouldn't be alive......"

[Miki]
"Kiricchi said too much."

[Kiri]
"Miki, you're naive. This person is the type who'd kill his own sister."

[Miki]
"That's......what is that?"

[Taichi]
"It wasn't me. She'd already died."
[Taichi]
"Besides, that wasn't even a knife wound."

[Kiri]
"How would we know that?"

I sighed as if vomiting.

[Taichi]
"Haa. Miki, save me......"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin's wrong."

*slap*

[Kiri]
"Why......I'm...for Miki......"

[Miki]
"If you keep saying those things...we're through."

[Kiri]
"Miki......"

[Taichi]
"You don't have to go that far."

[Miki]
"After all, I'm not Kiri-chin's doll."
[Miki]
"......isn't Sempai the one respecting me more right now?"

[Kiri]
"!?"

Ah, that one hit home.

[Miki]
"You have to respect your friends. Why are you trying to spread the seeds of conflict now of all times?"

[Kiri]
"But...but!"

[Miki]
"Come on, apologize to Sempai."

Kiri gritted her teeth.
She seemed considerably vexed.
She looked up sharply at me.

[Kiri]
"......who would do such a thing to you!!!?"

[Miki]
"Hey!!"

Kiri spun on her heels and ran away.

[Miki]
"Uwa, she fled......"

[Taichi]
"She's a good runner."

We both gazed at Kiri's disappearing back.

[Taichi]
"......by the way, Miki-pon."
//Is there any point in repeating the "this is yet another cutesy honorific" tl note? 〜IX
//Nah, I think they know - Sheeta

[Miki]
"I am Miki-pon. What is it?"

[Taichi]
"......did you...get taller?"

[Miki]
"Did I? If so, I can't see it."

Of course not.

[Taichi]
"Oh, what's this? Looking closely, your chest has......"

[Miki]
"You can't do that. Don't touch a dancing girl."

She guarded her chest with both hands.

[Taichi]
"Damn!"

Well, whatever.

[Taichi]
"And while we were doing that, it became evening."

[Miki]
"......I guess we'll go home. Kiricchi already left by herself."

[Taichi]
"Please go talk to her again later. There's nothing I can do......"

[Miki]
"Okaaay."

Miki is strong.
I didn't think she was the type to remain calm at times like these.
It seems a human's true value shows in a time of crisis.
