For lunch, I found that I did want to eat here after all.

[Sakuraba]
"Yo, Taichi."

It was Curry Bread Sakuraba.
He really likes the super hot curry bread here.

[Taichi]
"Humanity is annihilated, yet you're still eating curry bread."

[Sakuraba]
"......you want it?"

[Taichi]
"Don't need it."

[Sakuraba]
"If I eat through all of this, that'll be the end of it."

His expression clouded.
Behind him, cases filled with bread were stacked up in a tower.

[Taichi]
"......when were these delivered?"

[Sakuraba]
"Wasn't it yesterday?"

Yesterday.
For at least half the day they were selling bread.
This place basically functions as a dining hall, weekends and holidays aside.
Even during the opening ceremony bread was being delivered.
That's right.
In other words, until yesterday, the world was being properly maintained.

[Taichi]
"Even so, there's not much."

The number of cases wasn't even a tenth of the usual.

[Sakuraba]
"The opening ceremony was only a half day."

[Taichi]
"Even so......it's not much."

[Sakuraba]
"Also, I don't think that humanity was annihilated."

[Taichi]
"What did you say?"

[Sakuraba]
"I predict that all the townsfolk are playing hide and seek."

[Taichi]
"That's a delusion."
[Taichi]
"And don't use the word 'predict.' Isn't that a theory you just thought up?"

[Sakuraba]
"Hu!......you're so harsh."

[Taichi]
"Don't make that satisfied smile."

[Sakuraba]
"That's why it doesn't bother me."
[Sakuraba]
"Everyone should come back after some time passes. That's my calculation at least."

[Taichi]
"............I may be carefree too, but you're carefree down to the cellular level, aren't you?"

[Sakuraba]
"Hu."

Why is this guy in the same place as all these wounded boys and girls?
I seriously worried about that.
Sakuraba held a piece of curry bread out to me.

[Sakuraba]
"Eat."

[Taichi]
"I don't want it!"

I shot him down.
