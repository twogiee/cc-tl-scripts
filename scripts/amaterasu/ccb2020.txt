I prepared the rice cooker in the garden.
I wanted to eat rice.
I couldn't use the electric one, so I cooked it in a mess tin.
This is the best way to cook delicious meals:
1) Believe in yourself.
2) Weigh the rice.
3) Each and every grain of rice contains a precious life.
//Or is it NAT? - pondrthis
4) With those innumerable lives, people can keep living.
5) But every life will eventually return to the Earth.
6) The Earth is life, just as life is the Earth.
7) In order to someday bring about new life---
8) Long sci-fi novel 『Gaia's Journey』 - Fin
//TLN or fictional? - pondrthis
//It's not on wikipedia, so I'm assuming fictional - Sheeta
9) Polish the rice, and wash it for twenty minutes.
10) The summertime makes me want to eat some incredibly spicy curry.
11) Cook.
//One-word command sentences rock periods more than any other. - pondrthis
12) Stare long and hard at the fire, letting dangerous thoughts soak into your body or remembering comrades-in-arms who gave their lives to protect you (two choices).
//The two choices are in addition to staring long and hard at the fire, so no comma before "or". - pondrthis
13) Once cooked, steam them upside-down for ten minutes.
14) Super-delicious rice is born.

[Taichi]
"Done."

[Touko]
"......Taichi, thank goodness......so that's where you've been."

Touko came over to me.
Her face seemed uneasy.
The corners of her eyes were red for some reason.

[Taichi]
"Yo, so you were awake."

[Touko]
"............nn."

She nodded meekly.
She came closer, and wrapped her arms around my neck from behind.
*squeeze*

[Touko]
"......hey?"

She whispered in my ear.
I turned my head and kissed her.
Right away, I pulled her tongue closer......

[Touko]
"Wa-!......stop!"

She pulled her lips away.

[Touko]
"......at times like these, it's fine to just peck!"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

[Touko]
"Now do it again. A French kiss."

[Taichi]
"French kiss?"

[Touko]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Then,"

*kiss!*
Full power from the start.

[Touko]
"--!?"

*lick* *lick* *kiss* *lick* *lick* *liiiiiick---!*
A threesome between lips and tongue.
Then I pulled my tongue out.

[Touko]
"............"

I was sexually excited.

[Taichi]
"......wanna do it?"

[Touko]
"I-I'm not tat energetic!"

Her slight slurring was suspicious.
//Awesome alliteration aptitude. - pondrthis

[Touko]
"......and I just changed my underwear......"

Uwa, that made you wet?

[Touko]
"Even though I said......French......"

[Taichi]
"But that is a French kiss."

[Touko]
"Eh......it is?"

[Taichi]
"That's right. Tongues twisting around each other, devouring voraciously and crawling obscenely as if their mouths were genitalia. That's a French kiss."

*He's exaggerating.

[Taichi]
"That's why French toast and the like are such vulgar foods."

[Touko]
"No, I ate a lot of that......"

She's ashamed.

[Touko]
"With caviar on it..."

[Taichi]
"Forget about the caviar."

[Touko]
"......what would you call a...'light' kiss?"

[Taichi]
"Nnn, a 'soft kiss,' maybe?"

[Touko]
"Then, do that."

[Taichi]
"Nn, okay."

I touched my lips against hers.
Without overdoing it.

[Touko]
"......nn."

The atmosphere became bittersweet.
Because men connect this mood directly to lust, it's important to know when to quit.

[Touko]
"That smells good."

[Taichi]
"Are you hungry?"

[Touko]
"............yeah."

She was just a little embarrassed.
I felt any amount of shame was okay.

[Taichi]
"Then let's eat."

[Touko]
"This rice is amazing."

[Taichi]
"At the very least it's better than the electric cooker......maybe."

The latest electric cookers are amazing though.

[Taichi]
"The side dishes are instant curry and canned food."

[Touko]
"Yeah, that's okay."

We ate together.

[Touko]
"Ah, hot......owowow."

[Taichi]
"You've got a cat's tongue."

[Touko]
"My tongue is weak......"
(TL Note: A Japanese idiom referring to an easily burned tongue.)

[Taichi]
"It sure is."

In a lot of ways.
Touko blushed quickly.
Strangely, she had no spoken response.

[Taichi]
"As long as you have that weak point, kissing will keep ruining your underwear."

[Touko]
"Uu, uu, uuuu."

She resented that while holding her spoon in her mouth.

[Touko]
"......I've...failed!"

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."

[Touko]
"......but it's delicious."

[Taichi]
"Selfish instant curry."

[Touko]
"I've been saying......it's delicious to eat with the person you love. It doesn't matter what."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Touko]
"It'd be nice if we could stay like this."

[Taichi]
"......"

The night silently reached its peak.
Truly, without any sign of another human being.
