"You got here fast."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"And yet you're in casual wear again?"

There were virtually no regulations at Gunjou.
If there was any sort of obstacle, it was left to the guards.
There was no need for the students to judge themselves.
Which is why the decision to have a school uniform was practically meaningless.
Even for the one and only Gunjou, they couldn't force a girl at that age to change into the uniform.
It was to distinguish herself from others.
That was undoubtedly Touko's determined resistance.

[Taichi]
"I'd like to see your moe moe uniform look."

[Touko]
"......"

Hmmm.
It's rare for a character to be this well-suited to ignoring people.
Touko being in this situation forms a perfect picture.
I sat down in the adjacent seat and stared at her profile.
Forever, without boredom.

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
".................."

[Touko]
".................."

[Taichi]
"................................................ ........................"

[Touko]
"......what is it with you!!?"

She suddenly stood up.

[Taichi]
"Hey, works of art don't talk."

[Touko]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"Remain beautiful."

[Touko]
"That makes no sense!!"

[Taichi]
"You keep ending your sentences with 'ever so' like some old hag. Now stop talking or you'll ruin the image."
//I was planning to leave 'da wa' and 'desu wa' in there untled, since there is no English equivalent, but something ten or so lines down forced me to do it this way. 〜IX

[Touko]
"Whaaat did you sayyyy!!?"

This is hopeless.
She said, 'Whaaat did you sayyyy.'
The death of a work of art.

[Taichi]
"*sigh*...I've lost interest."

I tried shrugging my shoulders the same way Americans do when pretending that the oppressive notion of world justice has been thoroughly eradicated.
//Without the "do" it's a little odd... but I couldn't make it work with it very well. - pondrthis

[Taichi]
"I grant you the alias 'Destroyer of Art.'"

[Touko]
"I don't need that!!"

[Taichi]
"How nice. Picasso was often told the same thing. Guess you won't get anything amazing."

[Touko]
"I!! Don't!! Need!! That!!"

I whistled.

[Taichi]
"That's ever so scary."

[Touko]
"I don't say 'ever so'!!"

[Taichi]
"Use something other than double exclamation marks all the time."

[Touko]
"What form of remonstrance is that!!?"

[Taichi]
"Hu! Hu! Huuu..."

[Touko]
"Are you mocking me!!? You are mocking me! How dare you-----!!!"

Ignition complete.

[Touko]
"Isn't a normal conversation proof of friendship? Aren't you just approaching me with the goal of mocking me!? Why is an idiot like you making me look like an idiot!? I can't believe it, I don't want to believe it, I don't want to let it be believed!"

[Taichi]
"You're burning well."

You're the best.

[Touko]
"○×△□＄＃％＆○×△□＄＃％＆-----!!"
//Lawl at double exclaims. - pondrthis

When I focused my ears with great interest,
Touko's right hand grew hazy.
Ha!!?
*smack!!*

[Taichi]
"Gufu!"

An unexpected palm slap.
I was beaten down.
I fell over on such a grand scale that unoccupied desks and chairs got involved.

[Taichi]
"Ow-ow-ow-ow."
[Taichi]
"Just what I'd expect from the martial art, Harakiri Fist. You have no openings."

[Touko]
"The world I live in is different from the one with piparalies like you in the first place! My being here is a mistake just as all of you being near me is a mistake!"

*Piparaly = Toukoan for people with weak minds.

[Taichi]
"Isn't that redundant?"
//Easily the hardest word I was able to figure out on my own thus far. 〜IX

[Touko]
"-hut it!!"
(TL Note: "Piparaly" appears to be a combination of the onomatopoeia "pi" for electronic beeps and the word "paralysis." It is most likely meant to imply paralysis of the neurons in the brain.)

[Taichi]
"The hysteria of a non-virgin is painful to watch."

[Touko]
"--!?"

Her face tightened.

[Touko]
"Y-y-y......you are......you dare to......say that?"

[Taichi]
"Is there something wrong 'bout it?"

I played dumb while cleaning my ears.

[Touko]
"It's not just wrong......"
//Consider using "incorrect" if the word is "chiga(u?)", because it's important for eroge players to know who's a virgin and who's not (time-loop aside). "Wrong" can mean "vulgar" or "perverse" in English. - pondrthis

A slightly muffled voice.

[Touko]
"It goes far beyond any dimension......"

She slowly raised her head.

[Touko]
"Get the hell out-------!!!"

I was happily beaten out of the room.
