At an appropriate time, I decided to take a break.
I ate sandwiches in the cafeteria.
I began to think as I ate.
A one-week world.
Mysteriously, I had no resistance to that idea.
Because for me, this world would be much easier to live in than one which continued on forever.
Repeating days.
Then I had a thought,
That maybe I shouldn't have.
A week woven innumerable times. Within that, is there a possibility for everyone to be reconciled?
The unity of the eight Broadcasting Club members is in pieces.
Even if I wanted to reconcile with just one of them, it wouldn't be easy.
There's also what I got out of the diaries.
If that possibility is there...
......then I want to see it.

[Youko]
"Here, have some tea."

[Taichi]
"......nnn."
[Taichi]
"Nn! Nn! Nn!......Puhaa!! Cold and delicious, refill!"

I held out my plastic cup.
She took it and silently poured the contents of a water bottle into it. It was Hasekura Youko.

[Taichi]
"......don't mask your presence."
//"Erase" sounded weird. If you don't like "mask" try something like maybe "conceal" or "cloak" since all those fit better.-Spin

[Youko]
"Why not?"

[Taichi]
"It startles me when you show up so suddenly."

[Youko]
"I'm not masking it. That's how it is naturally."

[Taichi]
"......anyone would be startled if they were spoken to in such a sudden manner."

[Youko]
"You let your guard down?"

[Taichi]
"No, but I want to."

[Youko]
"Neglect?"

[Taichi]
"I mean, I want to live a carefree life."

[Youko]
"......that's a waste."

[Taichi]
"I'm tired. Being sharp all the time strains my nerves."

[Youko]
"I think you should just make that your daily life."
[Youko]
"Taichi just has a habit of skipping out on things."

[Taichi]
"We'll be through, you know."

[Youko]
"......I'll withdraw."

No argument was produced.
No bargain was achieved.
No trouble occurred.
I'm only receiving. I'm not being given anything.
There's no exchange of the heart.

[Taichi]
"That's the sensation of loving a part of yourself."

[Youko]
"......wrong."

She understands quickly.
But, she won't understand me.

[Youko]
"I only love Taichi."

[Taichi]
"......well, let's leave it at that."

This was a pain.
After all, she won't answer anything I say.
If I inflicted one effective attack on her...
......one.
That's a small blade.
But it's certainly breaking.
Youko-chan also knows of its existence.
That's why she's wary.
We're living while restraining each other.

[Taichi]
"Seriously now..."

I gobbled.
Kuu...

[Youko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"......wanna sit?"

[Youko]
"......may I?"

[Taichi]
"Go ahead."

She moved closer to me.
I tossed her half of the double portion of sandwiches.

[Youko]
"Thank you."

[Taichi]
"Didn't you make these?"

[Youko]
"Yes. Thank you."

[Taichi]
"......"

However much we pile on these exchanges,
We're just tracing an outline.
That's why......I'm doing it too.
//Not too sure what this line meant so I just added that hoping that was right.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Well, it'll work out somehow......"
