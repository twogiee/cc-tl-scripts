On my way home,

[Nanaka]
"Heeey."

Nanaka was beside me.
As if she'd just suddenly appeared there......

[Taichi]
"Ah, Nanaka......"

[Nanaka]
"How've you been?"

[Taichi]
"More importantly, that hokora---"

I was embraced.

[Taichi]
"Ugu!?"

[Nanaka]
"If you can say it's fun, then isn't it okay?"

[Taichi]
"No, I didn't say that."

This doesn't really match the context of the conversation...
What's with this abrupt heartwarming event......?
However, leaving that aside,
The ambiguous softness of breasts.
A girl's scent.
Mysteriously, I felt no disorder.
The sensation of being embraced was different from Youko-chan's.

[Nanaka]
"I'm happy to hear that. Very happy."

[Taichi]
"But, I'm not saying anything......"

[Nanaka]
"It's not like you have no right to live even if you don't become strong."

[Taichi]
"You're not listening."

[Nanaka]
"It's fine to be weak."

[Taichi]
"Listen!"

That didn't make any sense.

[Taichi]
"The texture of your chest was wonderful."

[Nanaka]
"......too honest."

[Taichi]
"It just didn't make any sense."

[Nanaka]
"Sorry, I made a mistake."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

Nanaka scratched her head.

[Nanaka]
"With a different one."

[Taichi]
"Explain it so I can understand it."

[Nanaka]
"You do seem to be getting started on the antenna construction. So how's it progressing?"

[Taichi]
"Hey now,"

[Nanaka]
"Nni?"

[Taichi]
"Speak so I can understand. First......first,"

[Nanaka]
"First?"

[Taichi]
"That's right, there are a lot of things."

[Nanaka]
"Then I'll answer one of your questions. Any question at all."

[Taichi]
"What...what color are your panties!?"

[Nanaka]
"Today they're white. But they're a little cute. They go well with the bra."

[Taichi]
"Pure whiiiite?"

My thoughts raced about girls' underwear.

[Nanaka]
"Okay, the questions end there."

[Taichi]
"Uooo, craaaap, the mysteries of the world!"

I asked my question reflexively!

[Taichi]
"I am an idiooot!"

[Nanaka]
"And you're erotic."

[Taichi]
"......no takebacks?"

[Nanaka]
"None."

Nanaka made a cross with her arms.

[Nanaka]
"Try again next time."

[Taichi]
"Hmmmhmhmhm......failure......"

Here, I suddenly thought,
Huh? This girl......isn't she a criminal?

[Taichi]
"Nanaka-san......one question......"

[Nanaka]
"Didn't I just say no?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's right."

[Nanaka]
"See you next week. If Taichi does what he does right, he'll make it there."

[Taichi]
"Make it where?"

[Nanaka]
"Here."

*smile*

[Taichi]
"Nnnnnnnn."

I feel like she's a key person somehow, but......she's not to the point.

[Nanaka]
"Didn't you go to the hokora?"

[Taichi]
"I went."

[Nanaka]
"......you didn't look inside, did you?"

[Taichi]
"Come to think of it, I haven't."

[Nanaka]
"Look."

[Taichi]
"Well...I don't want to go back there anymore."

[Nanaka]
"......well, there's no need to rush, so I don't mind, but,"

[Taichi]
"That's where Youko-chan's resting, so I'd like to leave it alone."

[Nanaka]
"Nnn. I think that girl would want you to go."

......so she knows that she died?

[Taichi]
"I can't face her."

I can't even avenge Youko-chan.

[Nanaka]
"That might be a cruel thought."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Nanaka]
"Are you saying you can't face her because you aren't equal?"
[Nanaka]
"Doesn't that mean you want her to be equal to you?"

[Taichi]
"Ah......that's right."

I noticed the contradiction.

[Nanaka]
"If you can give proper respect to the peanut persimmon tree, then isn't it strange to be unable to accept a weak person the way they are?"

[Taichi]
"That's true. Though the persimmon tree is Sakuraba's thing."

She even knows my past.
She could be anything......

[Taichi]
"Then, I guess I'll go if I feel like it."

[Nanaka]
"Yep."
[Nanaka]
"I also think I have no right to have human relationships."
[Nanaka]
"I'm glad Taichi had the same thought."

[Taichi]
"............"

Damn, she's cute......

[Nanaka]
"Work hard at the club. Work hard even if your friends die. It's okay, because you'll be smiling again next week."

[Taichi]
"Uwa, don't say such indiscreet things!"
[Taichi]
"Two people have died."

[Nanaka]
"Aaah, I should probably tell you I didn't kill them."

[Taichi]
"Eeeeeeeeeeeeh!!?"

[Nanaka]
"......were you certain I'd killed them?"

[Taichi]
"Somehow, you seem to have mysterious power, so can't you overcome all alibis and kill freely? A divine murder case. Though this isn't a mystery novel or anything..."

[Nanaka]
"Hmmm, divine might be on the right track."

[Taichi]
"And as you said that we reached my house."
[Taichi]
"I have string panties. Shall I give you some?"

[Nanaka]
"No, I don't need them. Even if I took them I'd just throw them away."

[Taichi]
"I see......"

[Nanaka]
"I'm going home. Bye."

I chuckled on the inside.
Where was Nanaka going home to?

[Taichi]
"Bye-bye."

The bicycle Nanaka was riding disappeared behind the hill.

[Taichi]
"............"
