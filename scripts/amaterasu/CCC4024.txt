[Taichi]
"We'll be going together for part of the way."

[Miki]
"Yes."

We walked.
On the way, Miki connected her hand with mine.

[Taichi]
"......nn?"

[Miki]
"I'll borrow this!"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

Meek.
Miki's hand was small and delicate.
With these hands, she survived being the arbiter of a world of only eight people.
Her timing when she kicked me as I ran was like that too.
Her movements when she saved Kiri on the roof.
That was nothing ordinary.
One who has moved by playing on the stillness of moments.
This is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary.
Miki lived on, and trained herself that way.
The word 'impressive' would hardly suffice.

[Taichi]
"Then, we part ways here."

[Miki]
"............"

She didn't let go of my hand.

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"Uh, ummm, uhhh..."

[Taichi]
"Is there more you want to talk about?"

[Miki]
"Yes, actually......"

[Taichi]
"Actually?"

[Miki]
"Uhhh, weeell, aaah, I think......"

Standstill.
I sent her a lifeboat.

[Taichi]
"Come to think of it,"

[Miki]
"Yes!?"

Her face sparkled.
Even though she'd become strong, she was innocent.

[Taichi]
"Didn't you save Kiri on the roof?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"My eyes are the only good part of me, so I knew."

[Miki]
"......haa?"

[Taichi]
"Those weren't someone's calculated movements."

Her eyes opened up.

[Taichi]
"And that's all I'll say."

[Miki]
"........................"

She stood there, as if hit by a divine revelation.

[Taichi]
"......Miki, live as you are now. You went to the trouble of preserving yourself this long."
[Taichi]
"I look forward to a far off other me getting to meet Miki when she's an amazing adult woman."

[Miki]
"......eh? Yes......I'll...become an amazing woman......"

A hoarse voice.

[Taichi]
"Okay, about that."
[Taichi]
"Here's my diary. Please make sure you put it in the hokora."

Her hands were feeble as she took it.

[Miki]
"............okay."

I bent down for my last kiss.
And parted quickly.

[Miki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Well then, see you next week."

I liked this farewell.
I'll go coolly.
I turned my heels properly.
I walked away gentlemanly.

[Miki]
"......Sempai!"

I stopped.

[Miki]
"This week! Thank you for taking care of me!!"

Her mouth shook with that standardized farewell.

[Taichi]
"......yeah."

[Miki]
"See you next week!"

She swung her hand back and forth.
Yes, yes.
Those who try to live on their own really make an effort.
Treating yourself as precious is a path that becomes harder with time, since...
This is an extreme way of putting it, but...
If one can change their mind on all their self-sacrificing actions, they'll all become actions devoted to oneself.
Miki is so right.

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

So we parted like this.
