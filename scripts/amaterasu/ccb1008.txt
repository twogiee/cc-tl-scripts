[Tomoki]
"Taichiii."

As I walked down the hallway, my name was called.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're still here?"

[Tomoki]
"Same to you."

Tomoki's face was like a noh mask.
We left a subtle distance between us.

[Taichi]
"I was at club."
[Taichi]
"I've been showing up there lately."

[Tomoki]
"......why this again?"

[Taichi]
"Well, isn't it nice to have goals?"

[Tomoki]
"By 'club,' you meant 'that' nonsense?"

The opening of the Gunjou Institute Broadcasting Club channel.

[Taichi]
"That's not nonsense, probably."

[Tomoki]
"If Taichi's doing such a thing......well, there must be some kind of reason."
[Tomoki]
"Who else is participating?"

[Taichi]
"The prez."

[Tomoki]
"......that's it?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Tomoki]
"That's not a club......"

[Taichi]
"We call it a club to pleasure ourselves."

[Tomoki]
"......lately, I'd known she'd been pushing a lot of things forward...so that was for the club..."

I shrugged my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Same goes for you. What're you doing now?"

[Tomoki]
"A club."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha."
[Taichi]
"......eh? I don't get you."

[Tomoki]
"A real club."
[Tomoki]
"Come participate if you're free."

[Taichi]
"That'd be nice, but......"

[Tomoki]
"......you'll be betrayed."

He spat out.

[Taichi]
"By who?"

[Tomoki]
"By the prez."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Tomoki]
"That's why it's best not to get too close to her."

Tomoki turned his back to me and walked away.
He was acting weird.
But why?
