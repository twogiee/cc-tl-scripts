Sakuraba was there.
He'd been sleeping in one of the beds.
He was fast asleep, with his stomach sticking out.

[Sakuraba]
"......guooo."

He's snoring.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba?"

[Sakuraba]
"What is it?"

Now he's back to normal.

[Taichi]
"Are you not feeling well?"

[Sakuraba]
"I ate too much curry bread."
//I sincerely apologize for depriving the staff of this file until now. ã€œIX
//Epic - Sheeta

So......he's awake?
//Don't know how many dots you would use there but I went with the usual 6.-Spin
But his eyes are closed...

[Sakuraba]
"I ate four portions of curry bread."

[Taichi]
"Are you a moron?"

[Sakuraba]
"I should have earned most of the points."

[Taichi]
"No, this place doesn't have a point system."

[Sakuraba]
"That's trivial. It doesn't bother me."
//Not too sure what he meant by "small thing." If it was supposed to be obscure then you know what to do.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Be bothered by it."

[Sakuraba]
"I can't eat anything else."

[Taichi]
"So I would think......"
[Taichi]
"Although I have these sandwiches."

[Sakuraba]
"Guooo."

He'd been sleeping.
Maybe everything he said was just sleeptalking?

[Taichi]
"Friendship desires-"

[Sakuraba]
"Nothing."

He gave a thumbs up.

[Sakuraba]
"Guooo."

[Taichi]
"Does this guy have no worries at all......?"

He is to be feared.
