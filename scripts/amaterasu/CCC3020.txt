Now then,
I'll leave the club to everyone else,
And go pick up Touko.
Let's go by car.
I gathered keys from the staff room and searched for a car that at least one would fit.

[Taichi]
"Oowa......"

The parking lot had become a tragedy.
As if a runaway car had repeatedly driven into everything.

[Taichi]
"They're all dented......"

This one's bumper is torn off.
Trees were broken.
Cracks radiated out on the front windshield.

[Taichi]
"......Tomoki-sensei......"

Tomoki was divinely talentless at driving.

[Taichi]
"So the mission was impossible for an amateur, kukuku."

Even I know how to drive well enough to get that far.
I guess some humans are just better than others.
I got into a car I had the key for.
As a man, this is a natural mission to carry out.
An automatic...
This vehicle's for girls.

[Taichi]
"Ke! I'll show you!"

I was violent.
I started getting reckless.
I hit the accelerator splendidly at half-clutch.
Crap, I hit the car right in front of me.
Good thing I had my seat belt on.
I'll retreat for now.

[Taichi]
"Back up, back up now......"

I ran over the chocks under the back tires and knocked down a tree.

[Taichi]
"This is hard..."

This kind of mistake doesn't even happen once in a million. It's a super-rare event.
Retry.
Crap, I left it in reverse gear.
Once in a million and another once in a million......how many is that now?
Whatever.
I'm so miraculous I sparkle.
Although this car looks expensive......sorry, deceased Professor Sakakibara.
I moved forward.
Carefully...with the parking break active.
I released it.
The car suddenly lurched forward.
I grazed the cars lined up on one side, and plucked off their bumpers.
I'm destroying things with decent efficiency.
Crap, I did something horrible to the principal's Ferrari.

[Taichi]
"......"

Well, I guess it's fine. His fault for Ferraring at such a dangerous school.
*Ferraring = Taichian. Two meanings. (1) To be or become the owner of a Ferrari. (2) (censored)
Forward slowly. Left turn.

[Taichi]
"That's good."

The engine stalled.

[Taichi]
"............"

I restarted it.
It backed up.

[Taichi]
"......"

Although I had fully realized this, the seat belt really is a necessity.

[Taichi]
"Go without discouragement!"

The car stopped moving.

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

Its biorhythms seem unfavorable.

[Taichi]
"Still, Japanese cars are fragile."

It'd be a dream within a dream for this car to get transferred to the Western police.
There'd be a mountain of concerns about it getting destroyed by fire truck hoses.
Youko-chan tapped the window.

[Taichi]
"......what?"

I opened the window.

[Youko]
"Get out."

I got out.

[Youko]
"Wait."

[Taichi]
"......yeah."

I drew the hiragana for "no" in the ground while waiting, and a car drove up from a far-away parking space.
She parked right in front of me, with practiced driving.

[Youko]
"Get in."

I got in the passenger seat.

[Youko]
"Where do you want to go?"

[Taichi]
"......I'll be heading to the Kirihara castle."

I had her take me there.
I was full of sad feelings.
