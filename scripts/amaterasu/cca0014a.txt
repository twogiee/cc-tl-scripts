"Hey, reversely-attributed competitive girl."

[Touko]
"Haa......?"

[Taichi]
"I'll give you this."

I held out the sandwich from this morning.
Touko stared at it in disbelief.

[Touko]
"What, is this?"

[Taichi]
"Sweet bean bread."

[Touko]
"How could it be one of those!? This is a sandwich!"

[Taichi]
"So you did know what it was."
[Taichi]
"Here."

*nudge* //Technically, "zui" doesn't indicate nudging, so much as a sliding maneuver, but any direct equivalent in english implies an actual sound was produced, and more often than not the sliding was unintentional and disasterous, so I adapted this a bit. ã€œIX

[Touko]
"......stop it."

She threw my hand off of her.
The sandwich fell.
I picked it up.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"That's none of your business."

She looked the other way.

[Taichi]
"Isn't it painful to have no one besides yourself to worry about you?"

[Touko]
"I don't understand what you're saying."

[Taichi]
"You want people to worry about you."
[Taichi]
"You want them to complete you."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"And I, for one, do worry a little."

She surely despises me.

[Touko]
"You sure can talk."
[Touko]
"If you're really worried about me, then why, why!?"

She suddenly stood up.

[Taichi]
"......Kirihara."

[Touko]
"What!?

[Taichi]
"Your face looks unhealthy. Is that biological?"

*slap!*

[Touko]
"Are you an idiot!?"

She spat out a curse as she left.

[Taichi]
"Ah, your sandwich......"

I sighed.

[Taichi]
"......there are better ways to kill yourself."

Without a better option, I unwrapped the sandwich and bit into it myself.
