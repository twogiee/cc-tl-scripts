[Shinkawa]
"Actually, I have some memory loss."

He suddenly said.

[Taichi]
"Just like a main character."

[Shinkawa]
"?"

[Taichi]
"It's nothing, please forget it."

Shinkawa spoke.
About not having any memories of his boyhood.
About being trypanophobic.
About feeling a pathological fear from the darkness of a forest.
Something happened to him a long time ago.
But he doesn't know what.
Kiri's parents wouldn't tell him.
Shinkawa Yutaka doesn't have a family.
Everything was in darkness.
And then he got sent to Gunjou, along with Kiri.

[Taichi]
......*munch* *munch*

I listened while devouring a pizza.
It'd been delivered.
At that time, I was extremely wealthy, so I'd been getting my lunches delivered.
Gunjou's rules practically didn't exist, due to the pretext that they're trying to heal our hearts.
For all they know, if I'd been stopped from ordering pizza, I might have become emotionally unstable.
If one is self-conscious enough, this school that isolates people on the pretext of healing effectively can become a lawless district.
......like a prison on a small island.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, I see. Memory loss. Hmmm."

I deliberated long and hard. Then,

[Taichi]
"Okay!"

[Shinkawa]
"I see......well I thought it'd be like that......"

[Taichi]
"I agree with the Shinkawa who has memory loss. But I am sorry to be subjected to the Shinkawa who does not have amnesia."

[Shinkawa]
"............"

Kiri entered into our mellow space.

[Kiri]
"You're both mating again."

[Taichi]
"It's Kiri-chin."
(TL Note: The word translated here as "mating" can refer either to animals having intercourse or to people hanging out.)

[Kiri]
"......please don't call me Kiri-chin."

[Taichi]
"But aren't you Kiri-chin?"

[Kiri]
"I'm Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Then Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Please use an honorific!"

[Taichi]
"Which is it?"
[Taichi]
"Hey, Yutaka?"

[Shinkawa]
"........................"

He was sleeping.

[Taichi]
"This guy falls asleep really fast."

[Kiri]
"......he's always been like that."
[Kiri]
"It's like an aftereffect of some disease......"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, that memory loss he had."

[Kiri]
"......Yutaka told you?"

[Taichi]
"Just now."

[Kiri]
"I see......he really trusts you."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Kiri]
"We had no friends at our previous school. Neither him nor me."

It happens a lot.
Especially when results of adaptation exams get leaked.

[Kiri]
"Even those who were our friends betrayed us......so we couldn't trust anyone......"
[Kiri]
"Even though we weren't hurting anyone, everyone hurt us."

[Taichi]
"And then you showed your fangs."

[Kiri]
"Isn't it only natural to defend yourself from attack?"

[Taichi]
"That's one way to think about it."
[Taichi]
"But shooting and killing wild beasts that protect themselves is the way of the world."

[Kiri]
"......are you not a human?"

Kiri spoke softly.
She burned with righteous indignation.
Kiri was too straightforward to live in modern times.

[Taichi]
"Inside me......there is something which really isn't a person."
[Taichi]
"Do you ever think that the humans around you don't matter at all?"

[Kiri]
"............"

[Taichi]
"I do on occasions. Only occasionally, but......if I ever became completely like that, I'd be finished."
[Taichi]
"I have to do my best to live. Just a little bit of wagging my tail and singing praises for those guys, that group that call themselves normal people......I have to live..."

[Kiri]
"For that, you'll take such strange actions?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno......never thought about it."
[Taichi]
"......you're that way too."

[Kiri]
"Eh......I am, too?"

[Taichi]
"Don't you want to live?"

[Kiri]
"I......"
[Kiri]
"I..."

She lowered her face and held herself.

[Kiri]
"I can't stand how scary the world is."

[Taichi]
"What part of it?"

[Kiri]
"......the malice."
[Kiri]
"Everyone's malice......"
[Kiri]
"No one......is kind......there's so little kindness......"

She was shaking.
Yes,
She didn't wish to come here either.
She had to come here.
That's what the country decided.
Disobedience couldn't be forgiven.

[Kiri]
"......humans, when they pass away, they're gone just like that......because there's hardly anything in the world......"
[Kiri]
"There are so many places with 『nothing there.』 There's hardly ever 『something there!』"
[Kiri]
"We don't know when we'll be swept away......that's what I think."

[Taichi]
"That's......like a sci-fi story about...humanity's annihilation or something?"

[Kiri]
"It's different from that......it's different from things like that, which have reasons......"
[Kiri]
"It's like I've woken up from a dream."
[Kiri]
"Even though it's scary, with nothing but quarreling......"
[Kiri]
"But sometimes I think, if everything suddenly disappeared one day......and if I was left alone......in this petty world......"
[Kiri]
"I......I'd......"

[Taichi]
"Sakura Kiri."

I called her back.
Color came back to her sunken expression.

[Kiri]
"Ah......I'm sorry......"

[Taichi]
"Afraid of malice, afraid of being alone......"

[Kiri]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"You can sit down and have some pizza."
[Taichi]
"One of the eaters fell asleep."

[Shinkawa]
"............"

[Kiri]
"......ha."

She sat down slowly. She didn't pick up any pizza.
Resurgence of emotions.
She stayed still for a bit.

[Taichi]
"The end result is being exiled."

[Kiri]
"......is this where exiles go?"

[Taichi]
"Yes it is."
[Taichi]
"But there's no malice, or harassment. Take a look."

I indicated our surroundings.
Lunchtime.
Those who could eat on their own were eating their meals little by little.
No gatherings; everyone was eating alone.
No conversations.
Only Shinkawa and I had been talking.

[Taichi]
"Everyone's passing time peacefully."
[Taichi]
"In a sense, it's a group of those with the strength to live alone."
[Taichi]
"Not needing to connect with people, concluding on their own."
[Taichi]
"Completed humanity."

[Kiri]
"That's......strange."

[Taichi]
"If you connect with people while inexperienced, mistakes and inconsistencies occur."
[Taichi]
"Aren't those also apt to occur between normal people?"
[Taichi]
"That's why people should become perfect and fulfill themselves."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Going to eat?"

[Kiri]
"Ah......I can't eat something someone else has touched......"

[Taichi]
"So you're fastidious."

[Kiri]
"......especially if a man touched it......"

[Taichi]
"Are you androphobic too?"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I'm not especially......it's just, for some reason......men seem......unclean."

[Taichi]
"You speak recklessly."

Is she simply becoming conscious of the other gender now that she's entering puberty?
She easily turns hostile, and in peacetime she's daunted.

[Kiri]
"............" (shyness)

......like right now.
Which means, if I dug under the surface, I'd find her to be deeply interested in sexual acts.
Yaaay.

[Taichi]
"No, why am I happy about that......"

I can't steal Yutaka's future wife.

[Kiri]
"Ummm, about that last topic......"
[Kiri]
"There might not be any malice here......but in this school......I get a much stronger feeling that 『nothing's here』......since no one will answer when I talk to them."

[Taichi]
"That doesn't mean they're ignoring you. The rules are just different here."

[Kiri]
"......rules?"

She acted as if she was full of questions once again, and she looked as young as she should at her age.
I understood that this was the real Kiri.
This bashful and nervously rambling girl.

[Taichi]
"You could say they're on a different channel......or that they just don't cross each other......"

I can't explain it well.

[Taichi]
"It's because both of our states of mind have normal bases, Kiri-chin. Our standards are different from those whose bases aren't normal."
[Taichi]
"If you follow someone else's rules when contacting them, you can have a conversation."

[Kiri]
"......how would you......follow such rules......?"

[Taichi]
"Just observe well. That's right......for example,"

I moved toward a girl with dark glasses sitting nearby.
She and I were actually crossing.
I clapped my hands.
She looked at me.
I held a slice of pizza in front of her.

[Girl]
"............"

She showed interest.
She tried to grab it.
I moved away a bit, and she stopped trying.
Her sanctuary was a radius of thirty centimeters.

[Girl]
"........................"

She thought, and held out her bentou box to me.

[Taichi]
"Okayyyy."

I took one piece of her tamagoyaki.
And in exchange I presented her with the pizza.

[Girl]
"......!"

She started munching on it quietly.

[Taichi]
"Just like that."

[Kiri]
"......what was that?"

[Taichi]
"Exchange of goods is fundamental to that girl."
[Taichi]
"Otherwise she's fine in her own world. So anything happening outside a thirty centimeter radius is of little concern to her."
[Taichi]
"It's a kind of Savant Syndrome. She's abnormally good with basic calculations. She can quickly answer what the day of the week is for some calendar date a few hundred years in the future."
[Taichi]
"Maybe she's gazing at a sea of numbers."

[Kiri]
"......is that person happy like that?"

[Taichi]
"Naturally."
[Taichi]
"Each person has a different form of happiness."

[Kiri]
"......I don't like that."
[Kiri]
"There might not be any malice, but I don't like this."
[Kiri]
"After all......even though there are people here......each one of them is closed off......as if on a solitary island in some distant sea......"
[Kiri]
"I don't like that......"

[Taichi]
"............"

It's almost as if Kiri...
'Please care about me---'
She looked as if she was screaming that.

[Taichi]
"Is that your wound?"

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

Shinkawa moaned.

[Taichi]
"Oh, Onii-chama seems to be waking up."
[Taichi]
"Do you like Yutaka?"
(TL Note: Yet another excessively cute honorific.)

[Kiri]
"That's............hey, wait, what are you saying!?"

She went red.

[Kiri]
"Ah! I mean! I don't!"

[Taichi]
"You're easy to read."

[Kiri]
"I'm telling you I don't!"

[Taichi]
"Isn't that nice, Yutaka?"

[Kiri]
"......eeeh?"

Yutaka woke up without a word.
He rubbed his eyes.

[Shinkawa]
"......crap, I fell asleep again............huh, my pizza?"

[Taichi]
"I ate it."

[Shinkawa]
"What, did you......?"

He was amazed.

[Taichi]
"But I didn't think you'd wake up."

Yutaka moaned softly.
But he didn't seem to be complaining anymore.

[Shinkawa]
"......"

Instead something else caught his attention.
He looked at me.
He looked at Kiri's red face.
He folded his arms and thought.
Once again Yutaka looked up at Kiri.

[Shinkawa]
"Okay, I understand the circumstances......so, did she decide?"

[Taichi]
"The wedding's tomorrow."

[Kiri]
"We're not having one!!!"

That sort of thing happened.
