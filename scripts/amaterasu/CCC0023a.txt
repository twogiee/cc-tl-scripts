"Hmm?"

There was a note left on top of the table.
『There might be dinner.』

[Taichi]
"Yaaay, I'm going, I'm going!"

I didn't have to make it myself.
I took three minutes to change, then went to her house without delay.
Dinner was quite delicious.
I lit the candle.
I can't use electric lighting.
And even for me, it'd be hard to read or write in the dark.
The solitary glimmer shone upon the inside of the room.
I liked candles.
The raw flame captivated me.
The wavering flame captured my soul as I watched it, allowing me to doze on forever and ever.
I once burnt my bangs doing that.
That was just three minutes ago.

[Taichi]
"......it burnt......damn it."

I wanted to cry.
But now for my diary.
I opened up the bulky notebook.
Records are precious.
Because the only thing to be certain of is that we'll be rolled back again at the end.
