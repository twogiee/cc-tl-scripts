IF $KAISOU == 1 JMP SCENE001
I woke up.
Sunlight was penetrating through the window.
I must have been sleeping soundly. I didn't have a single dream.
The time......7 A.M.
I have to go to school.
Miki was there.

[Taichi]
"Are you still waiting?"

[Miki]
"......ah, Sempai."
[Miki]
"She won't come, maybe something happened......"

[Taichi]
"I've come with a message from Kiri."

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"She went to investigate the atomic power plant with Youko-chan. How manly of her!"

[Miki]
"With......Hasekura-sempai?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Hasekura-sempai let her come along as a guest."

[Youko]
"............"

[Miki]
"......we haven't seen each other in a while."

[Youko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Okay, talk."

I poked her in the back.

[Youko]
"I'll be investigating the atomic power plant with Sakura Kiri. I will not allow anyone to interfere."

She said as if informing an enemy.

[Miki]
"I...see......"

It had a force which wouldn't let her say no.

[Miki]
"Where's Kiri-chin now?"

[Taichi]
"She's already on a plane."
//Not typo for the power 'plant'? - Raide
//No, looking at that sentence structure, it's definitely 'plane' - Sheeta

[Miki]
"Eh!!?"

[Taichi]
"So that's why you can't see her. Isn't that right, Youko-kun?"

[Youko]
"......yes."

[Miki]
"Is that so......?"

*sink*

[Taichi]
"So good luck with the investigation."

[Youko]
"......understood."

We saluted each other.
This is where her role ends.
........................
So, after I made Youko-chan go home,

[Miki]
"If Hasekura-sempai says so, then there's no doubt......"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Miki]
"But, thank goodness she's still here."

She heaved a sigh from her flat chest.

[Taichi]
"Well, why don't we eat some sweets at a more refreshing place?"

[Miki]
"......sweets?"

Her eyes changed color.

[Taichi]
"Solid and gummy candies. Handmade."

Her eyes changed color.

[Miki]
"Handmade?"

[Taichi]
"Mmm. By Youko-chan though."
[Taichi]
"By the looks of things, these are low in sugar and are good for your looks. The gummies are made from konjac jelly. Zero calories."

[Miki]
"Zero calories!?"

It's been decided.
........................

[Miki]
"It has a mother's flavor......"
[Miki]
"My cheeks......my cheeks are......"

[Taichi]
"Yep, yep."

Miki was in a good mood eating handmade sweets.

[Miki]
"Hasekura-sempai has many mysteries."

[Taichi]
"She does."

[Miki]
"Is she your lover?"

[Taichi]
"No, we just lived together once."

[Miki]
"Cohabitation!"

[Taichi]
"No, not the same as cohabitation."
[Taichi]
"We had no parents, so we were both being taken care of at that house."
[Taichi]
"Something like siblings."

[Miki]
"So that's what it was."

[Taichi]
"Now, let's have some thousand-year candy. Let's lick on these together like icicles!"

[Miki]
"Waa, thousand year candy!"

Miki smiled.
The day I spent with Miki was fun.
We accumulated many casual scenes, but,
I knew the value was heavier than the impression.
There's very little time left for us.

[Taichi]
"......maybe this is also deception."

But if she returns to the other side, Kiri will be there.
Miki will forgive me, right?
Both Mikis---
Wednesday.
To school.
A gate to prevent running away.
It didn't seem to be protecting the students so much as protecting the outside world from us.
That's the impression it held.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Miki]
"Heya."

[Taichi]
"If you're looking for Kiri---"

[Miki]
"Aaah, no, today's different."
[Miki]
"I'm waiting for Sempai."

[Taichi]
"Huhuhu, does that mean I can expect something?"

[Miki]
"My love emotions are at zero but I really like you."

[Taichi]
"........................"

Far away...

[Miki]
"Nn......?"
[Miki]
"Sempai, you smell of something..."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, this perfume. It's called Sweat Mint."

[Miki]
"You lieeeeeee!! There is no such perfumeeeeeee!!"
[Miki]
"Eh?......Bathing?"

[Taichi]
"Bath......?"
[Taichi]
"I'm a gentleman so I don't need to bathe."

[Miki]
"......at least pour water over yourself......"

[Taichi]
"We can't waste water, right?"

[Miki]
"Gua......then......today......?"

[Taichi]
"Since today's Wednesday, I guess this is the third day."

I informed her in a moronic tone.

[Miki]
"Haffuuu..."

She lost consciousness.

[Taichi]
"Are you okay!?"

I removed my shirt and bore down on her.

[Miki]
"Wawawawawa!!?"

Serious resistance.
........................

[Miki]
"......I can't faint carelessly it seems......"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, that was a spinal reflex."

[Miki]
"......what a dangerous spine."

[Taichi]
"Well, don't worry about it. I'm not going to die by not bathing."
//Sounded like he was saying "Don't worry, I won't die unless I bath first."-Spin

[Miki]
"I hate a sweaty Sempai."

[Taichi]
"......even if you say that..."

[Miki]
"Please come with me."

I was taken along.
Miki brought a hose out of a prefab structure.

[Miki]
"Sempai, strip."
[Miki]
"The bottom too, of course."

[Taichi]
"Very well."

I stripped.

[Miki]
"Wh-what kind of underwear is......"

Miki was bright red.

[Taichi]
"I saw this coming!"
[Taichi]
"So I tried being faithful to the original."

That which stood on the roof was none other than I in elephant underwear.
The handle attached to the hose was released.

[Miki]
"There!"

An intense flow of water attacked me.

[Taichi]
"Upu!"

[Miki]
"Take that!"

An infuriating Citrus Mint.
Body soap was thrown out.
And a whole bottle of it.
......do I stink that badly?

[Miki]
"Sempai, rub it in good!"

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes......"

[Miki]
"I'll spray the water, so Sempai, please focus on washing yourself."

[Taichi]
"I'd like to be unwashed rice......"

[Miki]
"Whoosh."

There was a novel splash sound that reminded me of the onomatopoeia for feline mammals.
//I'm pretty sure onomatopoeia is both singular and plural - Sheeta
Miki really was a promising rookie.

[Taichi]
"Even though you were all over Kiri in the pool, I'm just something to splash, damn!"

[Miki]
"......"

The flow of water hit the elephant's nose.
I erected.

[Miki]
"Why is that enough to make you do that!!?"

It made her cry.

[Taichi]
"Please listen to my sensitive body......"

[Miki]
"I don't care any more!"

[Taichi]
"I told you the lower half of my body is a different being."
[Taichi]
"Well......why not make this part clean too?"

As my rod rubbed lightly against the top of the elephant, I tried to undo the button.

[Miki]
"Stoooop!! Why do that in front of a virgin!!!?"

[Taichi]
"Gowa!!?"

A supreme watery force beat my face.
When I fell over, I could see the sky---
Miki isn't coming.
I remember.
The first day I met Miki.
I think I was the first to talk to Miki in all of Gunjou.
She was a lovely little lamb chased out of her original school and brought to Gunjou.
The first day.
She didn't bring anything which could be called lunch......I think.
I got that information via Miyuki, who'd become Miki's classmate, and immediately went in search of her.
In order to set up a coincidental meeting.
In front of the main gate, closed so as to not cause trouble for the neighbors.
Miki had been standing there at her wit's end.
One could say it was common freshman behavior.

[Taichi]
"Hiiii!"

[Miki]
"......eh?"

Then, a lot happened.

[Miki]
"Pu!"

She laughed softly.

[Miki]
"......you're a weird person."

I confessed a little.

[Taichi]
"Now that it's come to this, I'll eat here by force!"

[Kiri]
"Wh-what are you doing!?"

I got in an argument with Kiri, who had the same objective.

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha......what is this?"

While we warred with words, Miki watched with a complex expression.
However long I waited, Miki didn't come.

[Taichi]
"......there's no choice."

I was depressed.
I'd like to feel a breeze.
The roof without Sempai is a quiet and lonely place.

[Taichi]
"Haa."

I lay down and spread out as if making a snow angel.
//Yay for cultural reference rewrite. The literal was "in the shape of the kanji 大." 〜IX
The wind blew over me.
Though I wished to be taken away by it like a feather, the human body is too heavy.
Release won't come for me.
Humans can be aware of their own weight.

[Taichi]
"I have to go search for Miki, but......"

When I closed my eyes, my consciousness grew dim.
I felt something, and opened my eyes.

[Taichi]
"............Miki?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

Smiling.

[Miki]
"I am Miki."

The corners of her eyes were red.
Did something happen?

[Miki]
"Ah, please go back to sleep."

[Taichi]
"......I can use your lap?"

[Miki]
"As long as you do nothing perverted."

[Taichi]
"If I do?"

[Miki]
"It depends on the degree of sexual harassment, but..."
[Miki]
"......all relations would be cut off."

[Taichi]
"That would be scary. I can't do anything."

[Miki]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that'd be pretty scary. It might be enough to cause a hundred mega shock."

[Miki]
"......then...you can just sleep."
[Miki]
"You surprised me when you fell over."

[Taichi]
"I was sleeping."

[Miki]
"Again with the reckless lifestyle......"
[Miki]
"But, Sempai's the best at those times."

[Taichi]
"......am I?"

[Miki]
"Making every day funny and strange. Making as much noise as a festival..."

Tears.
When she cried directly above me, I couldn't react.

[Taichi]
"Miki......?"

[Miki]
"But, the more I play with Sempai......something's missing......Kiri-chin isn't here......nor is anyone else......my parents, my classmates......"
[Miki]
"......*sob*......our normal lives are all gone......"

[Taichi]
"......so even playing with me couldn't help. Well, yeah, nothing can be done about that......"

[Miki]
"That's not what I meant......"
[Miki]
"I...have no confidence......"

[Taichi]
"When it comes to?"

[Miki]
"Confidence to live on."

[Taichi]
"Don't say that. Believe in yourself thoughtlessly."

[Miki]
"......*sob*......I can't......"
[Miki]
"Kiri-chin is gone, right?"

[Taichi]
"............how did you...?"

[Miki]
"Somehow......"
[Miki]
"I mean, all the people are gone......what else could I think?"
[Miki]
"Everyone disappeared."
[Miki]
"So Kiri's disappeared as well."
[Miki]
"Will we disappear too someday?"
[Miki]
"Will we disappear, and be gone forever?"

[Taichi]
"......we might."

[Miki]
"......hey......ahahaha......even Sempai admitted it......"

[Taichi]
"You know, Miki, everyone dies in the end."
[Taichi]
"Are you going to give up on living now because you'll die someday?"

[Miki]
"......that's......"

[Taichi]
"It's fine to just disappear. Why not live until you do?"
[Taichi]
"There are plenty of fun things to do."

[Miki]
"......like what?"

[Taichi]
"Let's see..."
[Taichi]
"......why not live with me?"

[Miki]
"With Sempai?"
[Miki]
"Is that a confession?"

[Taichi]
"I'll buy you anything you want."

I passed my high-end gag by her, and Miki peeked into my eyes.

[Miki]
"Are you thinking of doing perverted things?"

[Taichi]
"I will do them."

[Miki]
"......uu......"

[Taichi]
"I will indeed do perverted things. That is the determined attitude that should be taken by those who believe in the significance of their existence."
[Taichi]
"The moment you cross my threshold, you are at one with the non-virgins."

[Miki]
"Fast......"

Embarrassed behavior.

[Taichi]
"And that is because, once you are like a cat in a box, virgins and non-virgins are identical."

Sudden drowsiness.

[Taichi]
"Guu......"

[Miki]
"I'll think about it."
[Miki]
"Wait, you're sleeping......so fast..."
[Miki]
"............seriously."
[Miki]
"You really are a weird person."
[Miki]
"Haha, ahahaha......"
[Miki]
"Ahahahaha...!...Hahahaha......haha......"

........................
When I woke up, Miki was smiling.

[Taichi]
"Did I fall asleep again?"

[Miki]
"Yes, with a thump."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, your legs must be asleep by now. I'll get up."

[Miki]
"Before that."

I was pushed back down.

[Miki]
"I want to thank you."

[Taichi]
"Thank me?"

[Miki]
"For cheering me up."

[Taichi]
"In that case, use that flat body to......"

[Miki]
"No, I think I want to clean your ears as thanks."

[Taichi]
"!?"
[Taichi]
"Getting up!"

[Miki]
"No!"

[Taichi]
"That's not good!"

[Miki]
"Nyaaa!"

A stick was shoved into my ear.
*scrape!*

[Taichi]
"!!!!"

After that, it was hell.
In the end, Miki didn't come to my house.

[Taichi]
"Friday, huh?"

Three days left until the world swings back.
Today as well, I'll do what I should do.

[Taichi]
"......crap, we have to go to the beach."

I forgot to set it up yesterday, but it'll work out somehow.

[Taichi]
"Let's go to the beach."

[Miki]
"......eh?"

We got together the necessary things at Atomic Goods,
Procured a car,
And headed for the beach.

[Taichi]
"Okay, now this is the beach!"

A cool pose.

[Taichi]
"And!"

[Miki]
"So fast......everything is happening so fast......"

[Taichi]
"And it'll fly on even faster."

[Miki]
"Hmmm, you're energetic..."

[Taichi]
"Now, let's play!"
[Taichi]
"Uuooo!"

[Miki]
"Seyaaa!"

[Taichi]
"Gaaah!"

[Miki]
"Ninuuu!!"

We enjoyed a game filled with swimming and sepak takraw.
And then lunch.
(TL Note: "Sepak Takraw" is a Southeast Asian sport much like volleyball, except you can only use your legs and chest to hit the ball.)

[Taichi]
"Fuiii......it's tiring when the whole sea is the field."

[Miki]
"It feels more like we came to tire ourselves out than to play."

[Taichi]
"That game was a failure."

[Miki]
"Having to swim so much......it's insane. That game's for mermaids only."

[Taichi]
"As a teenager I can't stay sane."
[Taichi]
"Maybe it's done now."

[Miki]
"It's done."

We both lowered our cheeks onto the cheap table and stared.
Cup ramen.

[Taichi]
*slurp* *slurp* *slurp*

[Miki]
*munch* *munch* *munch*

[Taichi]
"Cup ramen is good, since this is the beach, but it's also lonely."

[Miki]
"......it is..."

[Taichi]
"Yours looks tasty though."

[Miki]
"Curry flavored."

[Taichi]
"Trade a little."

[Miki]
"Okay, here you go."

[Taichi]
"......ah, it's good. Did we have another of these?"

[Miki]
"I just packed whatever, please go look."

There were a number of containers cracked from rough handling.

[Taichi]
"Come to think of it, we don't need dozens of cups of this."

[Miki]
"......don't forget those are my life as you hold them."
//I don't get this sentence :( - Sheeta

On the way, I had an accident.
She got really mad at me. While crying.

[Taichi]
"Ah, this looks delicious."

I took one out.

[Taichi]
"Nn......there's nowhere to get hot water from."
[Taichi]
"What is this container? This isn't ramen, is it?"

[Miki]
"Hoyo?"

[Taichi]
"Some kind of freeze-dried tofu......no it's a sponge......and there's some sticky fluid oozing out of it......"
[Taichi]
"Wait, this is a masturbation aid!!"
//Since other terms exist, feel free to mess with this. Especially if there's one that Miki would naturally not have ever heard of. 〜IX

I threw it at Miki.

[Miki]
"Gya!?"

That hit the mark.

[Taichi]
"You shameless virgin! You idiot!"

[Miki]
"What are you doing!?"

[Taichi]
"Look at the thing you threw in together with the ramen!"

[Miki]
"......nnn? What...is this?"

[Taichi]
"A masturbation aid."

[Miki]
"A what aid?"

[Taichi]
"To leave such erotic lines in memory, it's basically a sex toy. I don't like it much, but the disposable ones are only five to nine hundred yen!"

[Miki]
"......I don't know how to use it."

Why don't I show you how it's used......little girl?
//Best line in this scene - Sheeta
//I love it too. It really speaks to the pedo inside me.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Geez, being this defenseless makes your Nii-san worried."

[Miki]
"Ha, haa......I learned something today, thanks to a certain someone."
[Miki]
"There aren't that many girls who know proper maintenance for artificial vaginas at this age."

[Taichi]
"Indeed. It's hot today."

Though it wasn't hot.

[Miki]
"......hey, more importantly, have you noticed?"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Miki]
"There aren't any fish or jellyfish in the sea."

[Taichi]
"......yeah, I noticed. No shellfish either. Just shells."

[Miki]
"I found a pretty Rose Petal Tellin. I'll take it home with me."

[Taichi]
"There weren't any Octopus Giganteuses."

[Miki]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"Well, let's not worry too much about that. It'll just ruin science."

[Miki]
"......not that, I was just thinking that this is a lonely world."
//Everytime I read "lonely" I just think "ronery" now.-Spin
[Miki]
"That the world is a lonely place."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

The world is lonely, huh?
That would be true.

[Miki]
"Now, shall we play!?"

[Taichi]
"Okay, next is night wrestling."

[Miki]
"......don't you normally call that sex......?"
[Miki]
"That was fuuun!"

[Taichi]
"Yep. Let's go again."

[Miki]
"Yes!"

She appeared to be back in high spirits.

[Taichi]
"Aaah, those photos we took today, how long will they take to develop?"

[Miki]
"Do you want them quickly?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Tomorrow night if possible."

[Miki]
"Fast......then, I'll develop them at school, and give them to you there."

[Taichi]
"Thanks. See you."

[Miki]
"Ah......"

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

[Miki]
"Uhhh, no, it's nothing. Bye."

She ran off toward her housing complex.
Saturday.
......one day left.
There's one day left.

[Miki]
"Good morning, you're here early."

[Taichi]
"I would like the pictures."

[Miki]
"I was about to go develop them. It'll take a while."

[Taichi]
"That's fine, take it easy."

[Miki]
"Will you come with?"

[Taichi]
"......nah, I'll just hang out here."

[Miki]
"Are you sure?"

She was a little sunken.

[Miki]
"Let's have lunch together."

[Taichi]
"Nnn..."

Miki left.
I thought about the weekend.
With or without consent,
I'll just send her back healthy.
I'll carve casual conversations with Miki into my heart, one by one.

[Taichi]
"I really should go."

I headed for the Photography Club Room.

[Taichi]
"Huuuh?"

[Miki]
"......here I aaam."

She came.
With a huge bag.
The smell of soap.
A new uniform.
This is......

[Miki]
"Sempai's giving out a strange aura."

[Taichi]
"......*cough* Excuse me."

[Miki]
"This is a small hotel, manager."

[Taichi]
"Yes, we're popular among customers who fear wide open spaces."

[Miki]
"......even so, it's bigger than my place."

[Taichi]
"Hey!!"

[Miki]
"Hawa, hawa, amazing flooring."

[Taichi]
"That's normal in this town, since everyone has money to spare."

[Miki]
"My place was super-cheap back in the town's poorer era."

[Taichi]
"Aaah......that ruin..."

[Miki]
"It doesn't have elevators, so not having power is just fine."

[Taichi]
"What floor are you on, Mikinchi?"

[Miki]
"......the top floor."

[Taichi]
"You may cry. It's all right to cry."

[Miki]
"Uwaaan! This way I'll never have to climb the stairs ever again..."

[Taichi]
"Pitiful......"

[Miki]
"Now that you sympathize, show me to my room."

[Taichi]
"It's right here."

[Miki]
"That's your room!"

[Taichi]
"You know, coming to a man's house......"

[Miki]
"Aaah, I understand......"

[Taichi]
"It's best if you're honest."

[Miki]
"Umm, Sempai, may I ask you one question?"

[Taichi]
"Sure."

[Miki]
"The adjacent room......?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, you can't use that one."
[Taichi]
"Wanna go look?"

[Miki]
"What?"

I made her go.
She came back with a pale face.

[Miki]
"......th-th-th-there's a whole wall of pictures of Sempai!!"
//lol, that's awesome.-Spin

[Taichi]
"Isn't it scary?"

[Miki]
"It's painful."

[Taichi]
"Well, let's not touch it."
[Taichi]
"So, the floor of this room will be where you sleep."
[Taichi]
"Here's a sleeping bag."

Miki stared at the sleeping bag wrapped up in a cylinder.

[Miki]
"I must ask, what's the meaning of making the girl you invited over sleep in a bag?"

[Taichi]
"Guests always sleep on the floor in this house."
[Taichi]
"If you want to sleep in a futon, you must surpass the one hundred trials of me, Kurosu Taichi."

Basically sex.

[Miki]
"......"

She looked worried.

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey."

[Miki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Mikiii?"

[Miki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I'm going to do things to you."

I looked up.

[Miki]
"Go ahead."
[Miki]
"I'm prepared for that."

She was upset, but her tone was serious.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm......even if you say that, I was just joking."
[Taichi]
"But still, you're not scared?"

[Miki]
"I am...scared."

[Taichi]
"Right?"

Miki shook her head left and right.

[Miki]
"I'm scared because no one's here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, that."

[Miki]
"What happened to Kiri? Why did she go away?"

[Taichi]
"I don't know."

[Miki]
"Will I disappear too? Will Sempai?"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Miki]
"I feel like I'll go crazy."
[Miki]
"......hold me, Sempai."
[Miki]
"So that I won't disappear......"

She said that, and leaned toward me.
I had to accept her.
If it wasn't night, I might have been able to hold back.
But the atmosphere enveloping us was no longer one that could be rejected.

[Taichi]
"......hold you, huh?"

I moved my hands lightly around her back, and Miki clung to me.
This again.
One more memory---
IF $nonero == 1 JMP mikiHend1
I softly laid Miki down.
JMP N_SCENE001
:SCENE001
:N_SCENE001
I kissed her.

[Miki]
"Nn......nnha......nn!"

Her small lips were surprised.
Thin, delicately-made.
Wet and sticky, and surprisingly soft.
I lightly pecked.
A kiss as if poking her.
I touched her, parted from her and changed my angle a little.

[Miki]
"That tickles......wait, ah!......Ha!......"

I lose if she sucks on me during a kiss.
Then, I stuck out my tongue.
Miki's body stiffened.
I held her tightly, so she wouldn't run.
Sucking, sucking, sucking......
As if sweet honey was being pulled into my mouth.
I opened up her clothes.
When our lips parted, hesitation and a forced smile resided on Miki's face.
I ran my lips along her neck.

[Miki]
"Slow down, slower......uuu!"

Her collarbone panted.

[Taichi]
"You're really sensitive."

[Miki]
"Uuuuuuu!!!"

She covered her face with the back of her hand.

[Miki]
"......somehow......amazing......"

[Taichi]
"How is it amazing?"

[Miki]
"Being touched by someone...it's amazing......kyafu!"

[Taichi]
"I see."

My lips moved downward.
I moved back and forth over Miki's stomach as she quivered.
Her faintly breathing chest was movingly beautiful.
Thinking about the reason for that became annoying.
I reached Miki's lower limbs.
I kissed her there too.

[Miki]
"......aaaa......wait, not......"

She let out a strange voice.
That part of her was still young, and I wet it carefully.
I sucked on the protrusion at the prow of that boat-shaped region.
Strongly.

[Miki]
"Ow!......That's too......hard!"

I licked it with my tongue, and sometimes sucked it up.

[Miki]
"Aaah, ow, ow! You're pulling it off somehow!"

[Taichi]
"......"

What does that 'somehow' mean?
I slowed down a little.

[Miki]
"Kyau......kya......nn......awaa......"

That conduct was strangely fun.
I pinched it and played with it.

[Miki]
"Ah! Ha!......Haa......nn............uku!"

As I tasted her vagina, Miki choked just a little.

[Taichi]
"Does it still hurt?"

[Miki]
"......I don't know......it feels numb......hyaaaan!"

I scraped it around with the tip of my tongue.

[Taichi]
"Is this better?"

[Miki]
"Don't do it too gently!!"

Which is it......?

[Miki]
"That tickles......it makes me panic......"

[Taichi]
"I'll put my tongue in now."

[Miki]
"Ah!......It's in......"

Her defenseless voice put me in a lovely mood.
I moved my tongue carefully.

[Miki]
"Ah......aan, ah! Aaan!!......Nn!......Ha!"
[Miki]
"Nn, nnnnn!......Uun! Aau!......Noo, something's......climbing up......"

I used my fingers.
I lightly pushed down on Miki's precious gem.

[Miki]
"Nnn!!? If you pinch me...there!......"
[Miki]
"It-it'll come off, it'll-!"

[Taichi]
"No it won't."

I stretched my tongue out to the limit and pushed it into her.

[Miki]
"Nnnnnnnnnnn!!!"

Her back floated up, and Miki changed to a bow shape.
Increased moisture flowed into my mouth.
........................

[Taichi]
"Are you okay with the missionary position?"

[Miki]
"......I don't care about the position names......as long as......it doesn't hurt much."

[Taichi]
"It's fine, this is the normal position."

[Miki]
"So that's why......this one......"

[Taichi]
"Relax."

[Miki]
"Nn......I'm......scared."

[Taichi]
"Here we go."

I pushed my hips into her.

[Miki]
"Slowly, slowly! Slowly please!"

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes, slooowly."

[Miki]
"Uuuuuuuuuuuu......"

[Taichi]
"Slooowly."

[Miki]
"Uuuuu......uwa......aau!!"

I pulled out.

[Miki]
"......owww......"

[Taichi]
"So it does hurt."

[Miki]
"Kuu......"

Tears formed in the corners of her eyes.

[Taichi]
"But we're not there yet."

Miki's tears swelled up as she said 『Fueeeh?』

[Miki]
"I...I already came."

[Taichi]
"Don't lie!"
[Taichi]
"But......if it hurts, I'll stop, okay?"

[Miki]
"Ah......I don't want that either......"

[Taichi]
"Make up your mind......"

[Miki]
"It'd be best if you just squeezed me like this."

[Taichi]
"I guess that's the difference between a man and a woman."

Well, whatever.
She embraced me.

[Miki]
"......!"

I'm like a towel some kid carries around.
Something to cling onto.

[Miki]
"......I wonder......will everyone come back......"

[Taichi]
"Why don't we make them?"

[Miki]
"Eeeh?......'Make them'......you couldn't mean?"

[Taichi]
"I'm moving now."

A sliding life.

[Miki]
"Ah!......Nnnnn!......Uwa, I'm being dragged along!......"

I touched a part of her my tongue couldn't reach.

[Miki]
"Ah! Ah!......Uuu, uuuuu......"

There was a small sensation of pushing through a drawstring......and it was probably accurate.
There was a doubt as to whether it would break.
I moved slowly.
When I pulled out and sunk back in, Miki closed her eyes tightly to endure it.

[Miki]
"Nn! Ah!......Nnn!......Nnku!......Uwaaa, I'm going, to burst......"

She held onto me with rough breathing.

[Miki]
"Tight!......"

I'm sure she's bleeding.
I don't want to see that.
To shake off that feeling, I kissed her.

[Miki]
"Ah......"

[Taichi]
"Sorry......I also feel like I'm going to burst."

It felt like a bomb was buried deep in my hips.
I want to shoot it out.
I want to disgorge it.
When I pushed my hips in, my tip hit a wall.

[Miki]
"Haaan!......That......there......"

Shallow. Narrow.
And yet...

[Taichi]
"......tight."

I was being tied down.
Within that unending lubricant, I moved back and forth.

[Miki]
"Uhi! Hyan! Ah, ah, nn! Haaaa......"

I occasionally made twitchy strokes, and was accelerating.

[Miki]
"Sempai, I, I'm......"

[Taichi]
"Not yet, not yet."

[Miki]
"Nooo, uuu, uu! Aaon, nn! Nn! An!"

Her sticky slime covered her vaginal canal.
My thrusts made splashes and increased the viscosity.

[Taichi]
"Miki's insides have gotten pretty good."

[Miki]
"I don't, know, anything about!......Nnnnn!"

The strength left Miki's body.

[Miki]
"Haa, haa, haa---aaa! Ah!......Nn! Uuu, I, can't......"

[Taichi]
"You're ending this so quickly......"

[Miki]
"But, this is, so violent......"

[Taichi]
"Would it be better like this?"

Delicately.

[Miki]
"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!!"

Her voice rose. And her body.
As if she'd regained vitality.

[Taichi]
"Somewhere around here then."

I twisted at an angle different from her vagina.

[Miki]
"Uhiii! Ah! Aaah! Nn! Nn! Nnnnnnn!!"
[Miki]
"It's sliding in......kyan!......It's coming!"

[Taichi]
"It's only going in?"

I whispered while biting her ear.

[Taichi]
"It's coming in and going out, right?"

[Miki]
"Out, and in......uuu! Nn!......Han!......Deep, deeeeeeep! Aaaah!"

I was surprisingly close to Miki's core.

[Taichi]
"Something like this."

[Miki]
"Kya! An! No, not, there!"

[Taichi]
"Or maybe like this."

[Miki]
"Kyaaa, ah! Don't rub the sides!"

[Taichi]
"Does it hurt?"

[Miki]
"It doesn't hurt, but......it's dangerous......"

A mysterious way of saying it.

[Taichi]
"I like dangerous things."

I used my whole body to dominate Miki.

[Miki]
"Fua! Nn! Ah, you can't! Sempai no, I said no! ......Nngi!......Nnnnnnnnnnnn!!!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry......"

The heat of my conduct burned my head.
I won't stop.

[Miki]
"Fua! Uu!......Aaaa! Han! Nn, ah, akun......"

My hips drew an obscene circle.
Her walls adhered to and sucked on me.
When I pull out, I'm covered by a numbness racing through my spine and pelvis.

[Miki]
"Uuuuu! An! Ah! Ah!......Aaah!......Aau!"
[Miki]
"Ah......I think, something's coming......"

[Taichi]
"You have, skill at this!"

[Miki]
"Nnnn! What......skill?......Han!"

[Taichi]
"Skill, at feeling, good."

[Miki]
"!......You......idiot......!!"

She embraced me.
As I did her.
We'll become one as much as we can.
Suddenly, I remembered that this was the last memory I'd be able to make with Miki.
I also noticed I was moments away from ejaculating.
My senses had dulled from the excitement.

[Taichi]
"!!"

I minced Miki's insides.
It was that sort of aggressive rhythm.

[Miki]
"Ah!......Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! No, no! That's dangerous! Nn, nn......nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!"

I couldn't tell if that was a scream or a moan.
A lump of ecstacy, carved in small words that were mere aftereffects.

[Taichi]
"Nn......"

I beat against that.
Against its deepest part.
While embracing, without separating.
As if to test the mutual unity of our cells.
I continued disgorging.
It was as if my hips would fall off.
Then we broke.
We fell on each other.
And kissed casually.
I held the small Miki against my chest.

[Miki]
"We've......made......a baby......"

[Taichi]
"......is that true?"

[Miki]
"It's......intuition......"

[Taichi]
"Haha......"

I couldn't tell if she was serious.
The sensation of being near 『that』 Miki was nostalgic.

[Taichi]
"You're cute, Miki."

I contained her in my chest like a doll.
I could readily feel the radiating heat from what we'd done.
A sweet smell floated from her body.

[Taichi]
"......Miki?"

[Miki]
"........................"

She'd fallen asleep.

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

What a carefree thing.

[Taichi]
"......is that true?"

[Miki]
"It's......intuition......"

[Taichi]
"Haha......"

I couldn't tell if she was serious.
The sensation of being near 『that』 Miki was nostalgic.

[Taichi]
"You're cute, Miki."

I contained her in my chest like a doll.
I could readily feel the radiating heat from what we'd done.
A sweet smell floated from her body.

[Taichi]
"......Miki?"

[Miki]
"........................"

She'd fallen asleep.

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

What a carefree thing.
//The intro ends suggestively enough imo that yet again I can just leave this blank. 〜IX
:mikiHend2
I wiped Miki's body,
Threw the window open,
Held her,
And slept.

[Taichi]
"......haha."

I knew.
Small and warm.
That's what Miki was.

[Miki]
"What? A picnic?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

Sunday.
I brought it up while we ate breakfast.

[Miki]
"It is Sunday after all."

[Taichi]
"I've prepared everything."

[Miki]
"It's true. So fast......"

She looked at the basket in disbelief.

[Miki]
"Nnn, would that be a perverted picnic?"

I smiled.

[Taichi]
"I've been found out."

[Miki]
"Uwa, you are the worst."

[Taichi]
"Isn't that just fine? There's nothing else to do."

[Miki]
"I often think, 'If only this person was romantic...'"

[Taichi]
"You can't just live on romance."

[Miki]
"......that's blunt."

[Taichi]
"So let's go. I'll bring the goods and the costume."

[Miki]
"Wh-what are you going to make me do......?"
[Miki]
"And on the mountain?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno."

[Miki]
"Uuu, and I still hurt down there......"
[Miki]
"So, what are you going to make me do?"

[Taichi]
"You'll know when we get there, but......I guess I'll say it's in a realm you haven't experienced."

[Miki]
"Haeee...(crying)"

Miki must have gotten used to my psychedelic actions, since she came along with no doubts.

[Taichi]
"Miki, were your parents still around?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, both of them."
[Miki]
"Though they're poor."
[Miki]
"I mean, they were."

Past tense.

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry."

[Miki]
"Aha, everyone's gone so that goes for both of us♪"

[Taichi]
"Poor, huh..."

[Miki]
"I had very little allowance."

[Taichi]
"How much?"

[Miki]
"Three thousand yen."

Uwaa......
That is cheap.

[Taichi]
"You can't buy anything."

[Miki]
"Saving is important."
[Miki]
"And New Year's Money."
[Miki]
"When I was sentenced to go to Gunjou, I received an envelope full of money."
(TL Note: "O-toshi-dama" literally "year jewel" refers to a gift of money traditionally given to children by relatives on New Year's. It can be thought of as an annual allowance from one's extended family.)
[Miki]
"What was that supposed to mean!?"
(TL Note: In China this money is almost always presented in red envelopes.))

[Taichi]
"......dunno."

Ignorance is bliss.

[Taichi]
"Well, either way, saving will be important again soon."

[Miki]
"......?"

[Taichi]
"We're here."

[Miki]
"......a hokora."

[Taichi]
"This way."

[Miki]
"We're going to do it here?......Don't I have a veto power?"

[Taichi]
"No."

[Miki]
"Aaan."

[Taichi]
"Take this radio."

[Miki]
"......what kind of 'play' is this?"

[Taichi]
"That's so you'll understand the situation right away once you change over to the other side."

[Miki]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Walk this way, straight ahead, slowly."

[Miki]
"??????"

[Taichi]
"There you go."

[Miki]
"This doesn't really......"

[Taichi]
"Walk, walk."

[Miki]
"Ha, haa......"

That's good.

[Taichi]
"Stop. Now don't move."
[Taichi]
"That's right, take a pose."

[Miki]
"What kind?"

[Taichi]
"Your trademark pose."

[Miki]
"......I have no such thing......what to do..."

[Taichi]
"Just do whatever."

[Miki]
"......like this?"

[Taichi]
"........................"

[Miki]
"......ummm?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, it's burned into my eyes."

[Miki]
"What's going to happen......?"

[Taichi]
"Miki, I'll make a prediction."
[Taichi]
"In the near future, you'll become a tough guy."

[Miki]
"Does that mean I'll be gender bending?"

[Taichi]
"You'll become a good woman."

[Miki]
"Waa."

[Taichi]
"I'll leave you with these words as you gain experience and make something of yourself."
[Taichi]
"The letter X is made by crossing!"

[Miki]
"......nn?"

[Taichi]
"Huh? You don't know what it means? I just said something pretty moving."

[Miki]
"......crossing...doesn't that mean passing each other by?"

[Taichi]
"Uwa, don't say that! That's not how you're supposed to take it!"

[Miki]
"Ahaha."
[Miki]
"Sempai is as deep as usual, so Miki can't understand."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

[Miki]
"My first impression of Sempai was of a weird person, and my current impression of him is also of a weird person."

[Taichi]
"I'm not rising that far."

[Miki]
"And Miki became paired with that guy."

[Taichi]
"Yep. Give birth to a good child."
[Taichi]
"Aaah, it'll be a shame not to tell that kid about my extreme lust."

A real shame.
Or I should say, super-shame.
Regret.

[Miki]
"Ummm, what have you been talking about?"

[Taichi]
"See you."

I waved my hand.

[Miki]
"Umm......"

[Taichi]
"Come on, raise your hand."

[Miki]
"Okay......but..."

[Taichi]
"Smile."

[Miki]
"Somehow......"
[Miki]
"Isn't this like we're saying goodbye?"

[Taichi]
"Is it?"

[Miki]
"This is...strange......Sempai......"

[Taichi]
"I think I wanted a girl like Miki for a little sister."

Miki's eyes opened.
That moment,
Crimson nightfall.

[Taichi]
"It was incredibly fun. See you."

[Miki]
"Sempai, no!"

*click*---
Before she stepped forward,
I sent her back.

[Miki]
"......ah......eh?"
[Miki]
"Sempai, hey!"
[Miki]
"......huh?"
[Miki]
"Huuuh?"
[Miki]
"He's gone! In an instant!"
[Miki]
"Taichi-sempai, where'd you go!?"
[Miki]
"Huh? The radio's making noise?"
[Miki]
"............eh? What does that......"
[Miki]
"If the radio's making noise, it's receiving a signal......so a signal's being sent......"
[Miki]
"Ah......"
[Miki]
"The town's lights."
[Miki]
"There are...people......"
[Miki]
"Uwawa! This is huge!"
[Miki]
"Hey Sempai, there are people and radios in this town!"
[Miki]
"He's gone......he's nowhere......"
[Miki]
"I'll be going on ahead!!"

I was alone.
One more consciousness had disappeared from the world.
Even so,

[Taichi]
"......so she sensed it."

At the last moment.
What did her 『No!』 mean?
She shouldn't have known concretely what was going to happen.
So this is the sort of thing......that can be conveyed.

[Taichi]
"It really would be nice if she isn't pregnant."
[Taichi]
"No, it might be more exciting if she is."
[Taichi]
"......I wonder which."

I was thinking about such things---
