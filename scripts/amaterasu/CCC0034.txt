[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed her the paper bag itself.
Though she's a person who could procure any amount of foodstuffs by her own strength.

[Youko]
"Nn......"

She started eating.

[Taichi]
"Well, see you."

I started walking.

[Youko]
"......"

*chew* *chew* *chew*
She's following me while eating......
There, I decided to harass her.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Youko-chan, one moment."

I called her to me.
I held her head and pushed down on her hair.

[Youko]
"Uu, uuu! You can't......no......I'll surrender......"

[Taichi]
"Aren't you healthiness incarnate."

I grabbed her closer.

[Youko]
"Uuu, don't push......on my hair......the top feels weird......"

Her body wriggled.
I won't let her go.

[Taichi]
"Uriuri."

[Youko]
"I surrender, I surrender."

Midday ended, and I stopped harassing her.
