On my way home,

[Nanaka]
"Heeey."

Nanaka was beside me.
As if she'd just suddenly appeared there......

[Taichi]
"Ah, Nanaka......"

[Nanaka]
"How've you been?"

[Taichi]
"More importantly, that hokora---"

I was embraced.

[Taichi]
"Ugu!?"

[Nanaka]
"If you can say it's fun, then isn't it okay?"

[Taichi]
"No, I didn't say that."

This doesn't really match the context of the conversation...
What's with this abrupt heartwarming event......?
However, leaving that aside,
The ambiguous softness of breasts.
A girl's scent.
Mysteriously, I felt no disorder.
The sensation of being embraced was different from Youko-chan's.

[Nanaka]
"I'm happy to hear that. Very happy."

[Taichi]
"But, I'm not saying anything......"

[Nanaka]
"It's not like you have no right to live even if you don't become strong."

[Taichi]
"You're not listening."

[Nanaka]
"It's fine to be weak."

[Taichi]
"Listen!"

That didn't make any sense.

[Taichi]
"The texture of your chest was wonderful."

[Nanaka]
"......too honest."

[Taichi]
"It just didn't make any sense."

[Nanaka]
"Sorry, I made a mistake."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

Nanaka scratched her head.

[Nanaka]
"With a different one."

[Taichi]
"Explain it so I can understand it."

[Nanaka]
"You do seem to be getting started on the antenna construction. So how's it progressing?"

[Taichi]
"Hey now,"

[Nanaka]
"Nni?"

[Taichi]
"Speak so I can understand. First......first,"

[Nanaka]
"First?"

[Taichi]
"That's right, there are a lot of things."

[Nanaka]
"Then I'll answer one of your questions. Any question at all."

[Taichi]
"What...what color are your panties!?"

[Nanaka]
"Today they're white. But they're a little cute. They go well with the bra."

[Taichi]
"Pure whiiiite?"

My thoughts raced about girls' underwear.

[Nanaka]
"Okay, the questions end there."

[Taichi]
"Uooo, craaaap, the mysteries of the world!"

I asked my question reflexively!

[Taichi]
"I am an idiooot!"

[Nanaka]
"And you're erotic."

[Taichi]
"......no takebacks?"

[Nanaka]
"None."

Nanaka made a cross with her arms.

[Nanaka]
"Try again next time."

[Taichi]
"But by next time I'll have already forgotten about this conversation."

[Nanaka]
"Hooo, so you've noticed?"

[Taichi]
"I noticed. But even though I noticed, there are tons of things I don't know, like where humanity went, or why this happened in the first place."

[Nanaka]
"Even I don't know why this happened."

[Taichi]
"......is...is that really twue?"

I tilted my head and asked cutely.

[Nanaka]
"That really is twue."

She tilted her head and answered cutely.

[Nanaka]
"Well......all I can say is that this happened."
[Nanaka]
"I've tried thinking about the reason, but I've come up with absolutely no ideas whatsoever."

[Taichi]
"Oooh?"

[Nanaka]
"What were you expecting from a schoolgirl who puts flowers to shame?"

[Taichi]
"In the first place, that's just weird!"

[Nanaka]
"Mm? What is?"

[Taichi]
"Normally, isn't a role like yours given to a more adult and unintelligible girl!?"

[Nanaka]
"......haa?"

[Taichi]
"You're like a competitive childhood friend, so you should have some backstory fitting your mold, which demands that you obey me, live next to me and come to my house to wake me up every morning!"

I stuck my finger out at her.

[Nanaka]
"......are you an idiot?"

[Taichi]
"What kind of miscast are you!?"
[Taichi]
"Did you think you were doing something special by just changing your disposition, you simpleton?"
[Taichi]
"That is what we call a superficial thought."
[Taichi]
"If you want to do something different, start it from the foundation. Be someone who'll do things no one has ever done before!"

[Nanaka]
"All those words back at you."

[Taichi]
"I'm a simpleton who only thought he was the antithesis of superficiality!!!?"

I fell down in tears.

[Nanaka]
"Don't cry, don't cry, youngster."

[Taichi]
"......well, since it's come to this, pray I ask you the same question at my next opportunity."

[Nanaka]
"There's yet another surprising difference."

[Taichi]
"Eh, there is?"

[Nanaka]
"All the other people have their feelings decided by that moment on Sunday night, so they take similar actions every time."
[Nanaka]
"But Taichi's pretty different every time."
[Nanaka]
"......maybe you just don't take things seriously?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Maybe I don't.
The fewer 'others' there are, the better off I am.
That's why I think this situation isn't all that bad.
If I said I had no doubts at all, that'd be a lie, but......

[Taichi]
"I don't know..."

[Nanaka]
"I see."

Anyway, this conversation.
I looked up at Nanaka trying a wheelie on her bicycle.
This person......her memories aren't being reset.

[Taichi]
"You know......"

[Nanaka]
"Questions are prohibited."

[Taichi]
"Uu!"

[Nanaka]
"When I say something, I do it."
[Nanaka]
"Though it's not like I'm going out of my way to hide anything......you know?"
[Nanaka]
"......I'm just a little afraid."

[Taichi]
"Afraid?"

[Nanaka]
"I'm afraid of telling you everything."
[Nanaka]
"Because I get the feeling that Taichi will be driven into a corner."

Her merry expression morphed into one of misgivings.

[Taichi]
"......I see."

Well, a promise is a promise.

[Nanaka]
"......"

[Taichi]
"......"

It's gotten a little aloof.
I decided to soften the mood.

[Taichi]
"Umm......this isn't a question, but about your underwear..."

[Nanaka]
"Nn? What?"

[Taichi]
"I'd like your bra to have a front hook."

Nanaka's eyebrows twisted dubiously.

[Nanaka]
"A front hook......on Nanaka-san, the schoolgirl who puts flowers to shame?"

[Taichi]
"That's right."

[Nanaka]
"......your reason?"

[Taichi]
"Isn't that how a bra should be removed on a girl's maiden night?"

*Maiden night = Taichian for one's first sexual experience.

[Taichi]
"If there's a front hook, then I can stick my fingers into the valley like this, and at the moment I undo the hook, the pair of heavily laden motherly hills are released from admonition-"
[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"The heavily laden hills will be---"

[Nanaka]
"Don't repeat it."
[Nanaka]
"It's not as great a joke as you're thinking."

[Taichi]
"In......in other words, it is because I can appreciate their shaking form!"

[Nanaka]
"Rejected."

As we were talking about such idiotic things,
We soon reached my house.

[Taichi]
"......wanna come in?"

[Nanaka]
"No, I'll go home."

I chuckled on the inside.
Where was Nanaka going home to?

[Taichi]
"See you later then."

[Nanaka]
"Taichi!"

I was called.
Turning just my head, I put my back within my field of vision.
/He's like an owl.-Spin
Nanaka was on top of the hill.
Horribly far.
As if she'd moved in an instant.

[Nanaka]
"Taaaichi!"

Regardless of the distance between us, her voice reached my ears clearly.

[Taichi]
"Eh, ah, what?"

I was confused.
Nanaka is without a doubt---
She's standing next to her bicycle, holding one hand up high. Her smile held up the sky.

[Nanaka]
"See you next week."

She waved.

[Taichi]
"Ah, yeah......"

I turned all the way around.

[Taichi]
"See you next week."

Nanaka got on her bicycle.
The girl rode off, sliding down the hill until I couldn't see her.
However long I waited, I didn't see her reappear, slowly climbing up the slope of the next hill---
