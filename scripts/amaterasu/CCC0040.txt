Tomoki was there.
Inside the health room.

[Taichi]
"Tomokiii."

I spoke up, and his back leaped.

[Tomoki]
"Ta-Taichi......?"

[Taichi]
"So you were at school."

[Tomoki]
"Aaah, I came to see how things were......come here for a minute."

[Taichi]
"Oh?"

I was taken along.

[Tomoki]
"I think this will work."

[Taichi]
"Why are we in the corner?"

[Tomoki]
"......well..."

He faltered.

[Taichi]
"So, how's the Active Peace Maintenance Club?"

[Tomoki]
"Active Life Maintenance Club. It's working out."
[Tomoki]
"Taichi's had plenty of food, right?"

[Taichi]
"Well yeah, I'm in no trouble right now."
[Taichi]
"It'd be nice if that lasted a week."

[Tomoki]
"Ha?"

[Taichi]
"That's my business."
[Taichi]
"Do you need something in the health room?"

Tomoki's face tightened.

[Tomoki]
"No...nooo."

Why's he using English?

[Taichi]
"I see you're hiding something."

[Tomoki]
"I don't see that."

[Taichi]
"......health room, Tomoki, after school, virginity......the conclusion these four keywords lead us to is......"

It was time for deduction.

[Tomoki]
"No, virginity is unrelated."

[Taichi]
"That's a difficult question. It's time for meta-deduction."

[Tomoki]
"You've said something weird again."

[Taichi]
"Multiple Worlds Expatiating Deduction!"
[Taichi]
"Line up all the countless possibilities derived from each element and think, such that you extract 'that' sort of option from within the infinite choices......it's a quantum computer-ish deduction method."

[Tomoki]
"Can't you call that guesswork?"

[Taichi]
"Sugar content is needed to activate those thoughts. Please loan me some."

[Tomoki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Give me gum, give me chocolate."

[Tomoki]
"......Taichi, you're always carrying candies around with you......"

[Taichi]
"Those are to be used in the event of an emergency drop in blood sugar levels."

[Tomoki]
"Are you diabetic?"

Tomoki shuffled around in his pocket.
If I needed food right now, Tomoki's here.
No, at this point, Tomoki is food!
......that's stupid.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

Gum and chocolate really came out.

[Taichi]
"You are an amazing guy."

[Tomoki]
"Eh?......How so? And didn't you say you wanted them?"

[Taichi]
"With this my peculiar brains will be at peace."

[Tomoki]
"???"

Gum and chocolate.
I put them in my mouth at the same time.

[Tomoki]
"Whoa!"

[Taichi]
"Tasting them at the same time is great."

[Tomoki]
"Th-......"

He was sickened.

[Taichi]
"As for the rest of the deduction,"
[Taichi]
"Did someone get hurt?"

Tomoki was a bit surprised.
That was soon replaced by an ironic expression.

[Tomoki]
"Yes......someone got hurt."
[Tomoki]
"......it felt good."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Tomoki]
"......it's nothing. See you."

He left.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

I swallowed the gum that was also chocolate.
I'm the type who swallows gum.

[Taichi]
"......was it not a physical wound?"
