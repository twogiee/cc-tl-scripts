"I guess I should be going."

[Misato]
"Aah, that's right."
[Misato]
"This is a perfect time to go home."

[Taichi]
"Sleep when it's dark, wake up when it's morning."
[Taichi]
"That's how humans wish to exist."

[Misato]
"Yes, indeed they do."
[Misato]
"Then let's call an end to today's club activities."

It's a natural thing.

[Taichi]
"Shall we go home together?"

[Misato]
"Aren't we going in opposite directions?"

[Taichi]
"Were we now?"

[Misato]
"......you know where my house is."

*glare*

[Taichi]
"I'll take my leave now! Woof!"

I had no choice but to pull back immediately.
In exchange,
Until I disappeared into the school building, Sempai watched me while waving her small hand in front of her chest.
My heart jumped for joy.
