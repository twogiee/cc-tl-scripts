"Now then,"

I lit the candle.
While writing in my diary, I looked back a day.
Youko-chan died yesterday.
And today, Touko died.
Someone killed them.
It's unclear who.
I don't think it was Kiri.
Which means......not counting me, there are four left.
And one of them killed their friends.

[Taichi]
"......this is heavy."

But I don't know.
I can't come up with anything.
......what goal did the culprit fulfill by murdering those two?
Youko-chan.
Shot by an arrow.
Which means she got caught in one of those traps.
Even she makes a mistake once in a hundred times.
So whoever set up that trap killed Youko-chan.
I don't know whether Youko-chan was targeted, or if she just jumped into it.
Touko.
Stabbed by a short sword.
There were no signs of resistance.
She'd died as if sleeping.

[Taichi]
"......"

The footprints in front of the hokora.
My shoes.
But I have no memory of loitering in front of the hokora.
It's not memory loss.
Someone wore my shoes and loitered there.
Or perhaps someone with the same shoes?
Horrific thoughts passed by me.
What if I lost my rationality?
What if my aggressiveness was turned toward others?
......then I wouldn't need a motive, would I?
Come to think of it, are any of those four suspects able to make a trap that could deceive Youko-chan?
Is there someone who's been hiding their skills?
That's the most plausible profile.
......that's me.
1. Sleepwalking
2. Multiple Personalities
Since the traps were set up so precisely, I know it's not 1.
//Something just felt missing.-Spin
Could it be a 2 maintaining a calm enough intellect to make that kind of trap?
Could I actually have multiple personalities?
It would certainly explain why I don't remember it.
However......that's awfully hackneyed.
It'd be better if there were two of me.

[Taichi]
"......I don't know."

The diaries tied to 『unclear details at the present time.』

[Taichi]
"Nn?"

The candle suddenly went out.
There were light footsteps outside.
I stuck my head out the window.
......it's Kiri.
Walking down an empty street.
I saw her yesterday too.
Suspicious behavior.
I'd crossed Kiri off my list of suspects because of her hatred towards my realistic acting, but......
Okay, I'll follow her.
On the way, I borrowed a bicycle.
Efficient pursuit.
At long last, Kiri entered a meadow facing a grove of trees.
I can't use the bicycle any more since it would stand out.
I lowered my body and silently snuck toward her.
//Just sounds more natural.-Spin
Kiri took that out of her belongings.
A crossbow---
It definitely wasn't a toy.
Out of everything you could get in this country, it was a weapon of unparalleled strength.
Though it can't fire repeatedly.
It excels in silence, and abounds in destructive power.
Kiri pulled the trigger.
An arrow pierced a rotted tree.
The sound of air moving was left in my ears.
Kiri readied a new arrow.
She finished loading it with the cocking device.
Awkward.
But, I knew.
This is training.
To fight.
But, with who?
With......who......?
It was as if a dark aura was coming from Kiri.
//Regardless of the race factor, I'm sure you've seen "dark aura" used in situations like this all the time.-Spin
Eyes that had lost emotion.
Mechanical movements.
Whether it hit or missed, her expression remained unchanged.

[Kiri]
『Why do you keep acting so friendly!!!?』
[Kiri]
『......who would do such a thing to you!!!?』
[Kiri]
『Murderer! Who are you going to kill next!?』

There are still many mysteries surrounding Touko and Youko-chan's cases.
But,
I understand Kiri's motives all too well.
She continued that training for an hour.
She must have been worn out, since she gathered her things slowly before heading back.
I walked across the plain and examined the targeted tree.
I returned home.
I was tired......
Sakuraba was there.

[Taichi]
"......hey."

I kicked his butt.

[Sakuraba]
"Oooh, Taichi."

Sakuraba had been eating cucumbers.
Cucumbers from Tomoki's delivery.

[Taichi]
"And?"

[Sakuraba]
"Please listen."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Sakuraba]
"I've grown bored of curry bread."

[Taichi]
"......you know..."

[Sakuraba]
"So I tried coming to your house, since I thought there might be cucumbers."

[Taichi]
"Why did you come to my house?"

[Sakuraba]
"I told Tomoki I didn't need food."

[Taichi]
"Wh-why?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because I had curry bread."

What a limited life.

[Taichi]
"That aside, what's with the super-huge baggage?"

[Sakuraba]
"Aaah. I'm going on a journey."
//It just gets better and better. 〜IX
//Honestly, I would probably do the same thing in that situation.-Spin

[Taichi]
"........................say what?"

[Sakuraba]
"A journey."

[Taichi]
"You......in this situation......you're going to go traveling?"

[Sakuraba]
"That's right. Journeys are good."

Sakuraba spoke vacantly.

[Sakuraba]
"Don't you think journeys are needed in this day and age?"

[Taichi]
"I think staying in place would be......"

[Sakuraba]
"That's backward thinking."
//And that's exactly what I would have said.-Spin

[Taichi]
"I-is it!?"

He's...he's going on a journey.
I started thinking of Sakuraba as a winner of some kind.

[Sakuraba]
"So, I'd like to split your food."

[Taichi]
"......well, I don't really mind."

The two of us sorted out the food in the Tomoki Box (the cardboard box he delivered).

[Taichi]
"So, where are you going?"

[Sakuraba]
"I haven't decided. I'll think about it when I reach the neighboring town."
[Sakuraba]
"Besides, I might find some people there."

[Taichi]
"......hmmm."

So it's not that he isn't thinking about it.

[Taichi]
"Bring a handy (wireless) with you. It doesn't seem like anyone's broadcasting, but we can probably stay connected."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, I have one."

[Taichi]
"It's SSB, right? We're borrowing a transoceanic antenna, so wait a bit."
//eh? 〜IX
//Assuming you're still not sure: Single-Sideband. It gets more range and less power usage but generally more expensive.-Spin

[Sakuraba]
"Sorry."

I have some slight knowledge about watches.
//Yeah I have no idea what he's talking about. 〜IX
//I'm assuming its a watch that has a radio function on it? - Sheeta
A super-long range communications antenna made of chopsticks and nichrome wire.
I'd brought one.

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Sakuraba]
"Aaah, thanks. With this I can talk to foreigners."

[Taichi]
"Hahaha, if you speak their language. Unfortunately, Sakuraba, with your knowledge---"

[Sakuraba]
"Could you pay me back the shipping charge? (onegaishimasu, hempin no souryou wo harattekudasai)"
//Hopefully the voices will make it sufficiently obvious that he's speaking English and the parenthesis were a Japanese tl for the Japanese readers. 〜IX

[Taichi]
"......EH?"

[Sakuraba]
"What a fiasco it is! (sore wa nanto hidoi jiken nano deshou)"

[Taichi]
"......SERIOUSLY?"

No, isn't this English?

[Sakuraba]
"Well, if they know English it'll work out."
[Sakuraba]
"......I lived in America a long time ago, so I can speak a little."

What!?
This guy......he couldn't have been......a casual bilingual.

[Sakuraba]
"If they're Russian, I'll leave them to you."

[Taichi]
"Ah, yeah, Russian is actually a strong suit of mine!"

[Sakuraba]
"It is?"

[Taichi]
"Ha, hahaha, well good luck, wait, when will you come back?"

[Sakuraba]
"When I want to come back."

I see.

[Sakuraba]
"Also, I borrowed some money from you, didn't I?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, a little."

[Sakuraba]
"How much was it?"

Even though there's no longer any meaning in money.
Strange guy.
//That sounded really off. I thought maybe change it to this or "What a strange guy."-Spin

[Taichi]
"Well...I don't remember the amount..."

[Sakuraba]
"For now, I'll hand you my pocket change."
//The voice had a comma in it.-Spin

He took out his wallet.
I received it.
I heard a cha-ching noise.

[Taichi]
"Haha, even casual bilinguals are poor at times."

Sakuraba smiled calmly.

[Sakuraba]
"Well yeah. Being rich is like that."

[Taichi]
"Hahaha."

[Sakuraba]
"Hahaha!"

We laughed together.
We crossed our arms.
Our friendship deepened.

[Taichi]
"Okay, okay, how much is in here?"

I opened his wallet.
As I feared, there was no paper money.
Inside were fifteen coins, each a hundred thousand yen.

[Taichi]
"Mister yen!!"

Swoon.

[Sakuraba]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"

I writhed around like a caterpillar.
What's with this wallet!!?
I've never seen something so amazing!!
On closer inspection, it wasn't just hundred thousand yen coins.
Hundred thousand yen gold coin in memorial of the Shouwa emperor who reigned for sixty years X 8
Hundred thousand yen gold coin in memorial of the emperor's accession to the throne X 7
Fifty thousand yen gold coin in memorial of his highness the crown prince's wedding X 2
Five thousand yen coin depicting the International Garden and Greenery Exposition X 4
Five thousand yen silver coin depicting the crown prince's wedding X 3
//There was a line seperating these two lines so I'm assuming that that was accidently deleted.-Spin
And that's not all.

[Taichi]
"Are you a moron!?"

[Sakuraba]
"I couldn't really use these for buying stuff."

[Taichi]
"Of course not!"

This guy......flashing such huge sums around......
For the Sakurabas......could a hundred thousand yen possibly......not be that big......not be that big......? (Echo)

[Taichi]
"Ha!?"

Before humanity's annihilation, if I'd pestered him just once during the time when money held meaning...

[Taichi]
"Ou-ou-ou-ou!"

[Sakuraba]
"Why do you cry?"

[Taichi]
"OOOOOoooo!!"

God is being allowed to torture us!
I was filled with regret.

[Sakuraba]
"Please use that to pay off whatever was left."

He took a wooden box out of his baggage.
Inside was an out-of-date Shan Shui.

[Taichi]
"What's this?"
(TL Note: "Shan Shui" is a famous Chinese style of landscape painting.)

[Sakuraba]
"I chose something fittingly expensive-looking."

[Taichi]
"The artist......ummm......it's got a tag... Denshuu Bumpitsu?"

[Sakuraba]
"Is he famous?"
(TL Note: This might be a joke, since "Shuubun" was a famous 14th century Japanese landscape painter and "Dempitsu" means "legendary brush")

[Taichi]
"Lemme check."

I brought a relevant picture book from Mutsumi-san's room.

[Taichi]
"It probably won't be in here if it's something cheap."

[Sakuraba]
"That would be a problem. This was the most expensive-looking one."

[Taichi]
"Denshuu-san...just how much effort did you put into this?"

National treasure and important cultural relic.

[Taichi]
"------------"

Faint.

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, Taichi! Taichi!"

........................

[Taichi]
"You......if this was the real thing......wouldn't that be blaspheming the country?"

[Sakuraba]
"Would it? I don't think it's much more than bonfire fuel."

Destroyer of culture......this guy's a destroyer of culture!!
I merely shook like a kitten.
As I was shaking, Sakuraba suddenly said,

[Sakuraba]
"Also......won't you come with me?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?......Me? Go on a journey?"

[Sakuraba]
"I invited Tomoki too, but...he seems to have things to do here."

[Taichi]
"Well, yeah."

[Sakuraba]
"What'll it be?"

[Taichi]
"......it sounds fun, but..."

Everyone's faces passed through my mind.
Along with many and various mysteries.

[Taichi]
"I'll pass."

[Sakuraba]
"I see."

Sakuraba didn't seem that disappointed.

[Sakuraba]
"Then I'll go now."

[Taichi]
"Why not wait until tomorrow at least? Aren't the mountains dangerous?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm in the mood to go now."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, you're the type to get stranded."

[Sakuraba]
"So, now that we've split the food, I'll be going."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

I watched him go.

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's right, may I ask something?"

[Sakuraba]
"Nn?"

[Taichi]
"Is there anyone in the Broadcasting Club you hate enough to kill?"

[Sakuraba]
"Nope. I love everyone."
//This would make more sense because the next two lines seem to imply he said something more than just "like."-Spin

[Taichi]
"How vigorous."

[Sakuraba]
"I didn't mean it that way. Because I'm mentally incompetent, there's hardly any of that desire."

That's actually true.

[Sakuraba]
"My lust remains as it was on that day, at that time; stolen by you."

He seemed happy.

[Taichi]
"That's gross, so stop it."

[Sakuraba]
"No, for a spontaneous human like me, it's best not to have too much lust."
[Sakuraba]
"Instead, I'm doing other things I want to do."

That day when Sakuraba's eardrums were broken.
This guy calmed down beyond belief.
And, at the same time, lost his lust.
It's unclear what the cause is.
The wound of unrequited love? Spiritual awakening?
Sakuraba doesn't know that either.

[Taichi]
"One more question."
[Taichi]
"Have you ever killed someone?"

[Sakuraba]
"No, never."

[Taichi]
"......I see."
[Taichi]
"I understand. Get going."

[Sakuraba]
"Aaah, see you......"

I thought while watching him leave.
If he was the culprit, then I just let him get away right under my nose.
But...well, whatever.
It's probably not him.
Like that,
Sakuraba disappeared.
//Call the mourners. 〜IX
//Damn. Oh well, he should be back next week anyway.-Spin
