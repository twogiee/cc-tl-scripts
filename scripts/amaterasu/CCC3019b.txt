Miki was here.

[Taichi]
"Heeey, you, the first year."

[Miki]
"Ah, Sempai's wearing clothes."

[Taichi]
"Gufu!"

[Miki]
"You're not exposing your thing anymore......thank goodness..."

[Taichi]
"Speak not of my thing."
[Taichi]
"Even I don't know why it was being exposed."

[Miki]
"........................"

Why'd she fall silent?

[Taichi]
"More importantly, what's this cardboard box?"

[Miki]
"Aaah, I was thinking of playing by myself with that......but I've already been found out."
[Miki]
"This is a Mikihouse."

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"Is that okay?"

[Miki]
"I wonder what it is you're referring to."

[Taichi]
"Well......various......"

[Miki]
"It's Miki's house, so Mikihouse. What sort of problem is there?"

Now that you mention it, that makes sense.

[Miki]
"I'll take time between my movements so as not to be spotted when I'm in enemy territory."

[Taichi]
"That wouldn't work."

[Miki]
"Are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"Obviously any normal young adult that saw the Mikihouse would think 『Are there any good children's clothes in here?』 and dandily peek inside."

[Miki]
"......uuu, I'll only be able to sell what I have on me."

[Taichi]
"How much?"

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"How much do you want for them?"

[Miki]
"Why are you suddenly saying that with a serious face?"

[Taichi]
"Because this is the serious generation. But that doesn't matter at all."
[Taichi]
"Now, how much?"

[Miki]
"Nnn, I wonder..."

Like a little devil, she showed me a mischievous face.

[Miki]
"Then, a million yen per outfit. This price is decided on the spot. But the price right now is for a limited time only. If you can pay it now, I wouldn't mind stripping it off and handing it to you right here. But if you can't, then I won't."

I handed her ten of the coins I got from Sakuraba.

[Taichi]
"I've decided on the spot to buy it."
//hahaha, she got owned.-Spin

[Miki]
"........................eah?"

Miki produced a question word matching the atmosphere of the room as her expression froze.

[Taichi]
"......I shall have you strip right here."
[Taichi]
"It's a shame this doesn't have a view screen, but I shall at least record your changing scene."

I readied a camera. Good thing we're in the club room.
Okay, the batteries are still charged.
//Old line made me think he was asking "okay?"-Spin

[Miki]
"............ah! Umm......these are?"

[Taichi]
"Hundred thousand yen coins. Though Miki wouldn't know about them."
[Taichi]
"During the Shouwa period, we warred, and expanded, and became hated by the world, and yet that period lasted over sixty years."

[Miki]
"Can these really be used?"
(TL Note: The Shouwa period is synonymous with Emperor Hirohito's reign, so he's referring to WWII.)

[Taichi]
"You can't really use them, but they are official currency."
[Taichi]
"Anyway, I made my decision on the spot. I've paid you the money. Now it's your turn."
//"Now" stood out and also, "anyway" helps with the transition better.-Spin

[Miki]
"Hi!......"

Terror.

[Taichi]
"If you run contrary to your promise......I'll give you a rating of 『Extremely Poor.』"

[Miki]
"To a girl, such a rumor would be a danger among dangers."

[Taichi]
"Then strip."

[Miki]
"Ha, hawaaa, fuwa......th-that's......"

[Kiri]
"Please wait!"

It was Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Uu! You're Kiri!"

I was kicked.
I guarded my head.
But,

[Kiri]
"......I'll strip in your place."

Both Of Us: "Eeeeeeeeeeeh!!?"
Kiri stuck her hand inside her skirt and pulled down her underwear.

[Kiri]
*sob*......

[Taichi]
"Okay, okay, it's fine, it's fine! I changed my mind!"

[Kiri]
"......are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"I'm not into making maidens cry."

We'd at least have to be alone......

[Miki]
"Thank youuu, Kiri-chiii!"

[Kiri]
"Miki! I'm so glad you're safe."

*grab*
The two embraced.
......I'm the villain in this world, aren't I?
