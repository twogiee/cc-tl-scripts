Touko was there in the classroom.
She was sleeping with her head on the desk.
How long had she been sitting here?
Not running away to a club like Tomoki or Mimi-sempai,
Not having days of relief like me,
She doesn't even have an iron wall of ego like Youko-chan.
Touko might not have a place to run to.
That's......no different from before.
Even in the world before humanity's annihilation.
Touko was alone.
She'd always lived by showing a brave front.
So after falling apart once, she was fragile.
I approached her and spoke.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Touuuuko."

[Touko]
"......uuun..."

She budged.
But didn't wake up.

[Taichi]
"Wanna eat a sandwich?"

[Touko]
"......I have no appetite......"

She soon went back to sleep.

[Taichi]
"I see."

She's worn out, physically and emotionally.
Is she really eating properly?
I took some candies out from my pocket and let them roll around on her desk.
