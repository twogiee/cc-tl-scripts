"Phew."

There was a note on the table.
"There might be supper for you."

[Taichi]
"Yay, on my way!"

I didn't have to prep it myself.
I changed clothes in three minutes, then rushed over
to her house.
Supper was delicious.
I lit a candle.
The candle's characteristic light illuminated the
room.
I liked candles.
The flame, it attracted me.
My heart was so captured by the flickering flame
that I could lose myself for hours.
I've burnt my hair because of that before.
Actually, just three minutes ago.

[Taichi]
"Burned it again... Bullcrap."

I was about to cry.
Anyhow, the diary.
I opened the thick diary.
Recording life was important, right?
Today, I went to school but skipped classes. Touko
was especially prickly today. Pssh, her being on her
period is no excuse to take things out on others.
I took out my revenge on her, by writing nasty
things in my diary.
No, don't!
Heheh, you say "no", but your body says "yes."
Ah, no! That's not true! Stop, stop!
Too late! A man can't back out once he has gone this
far! Look at my precious.
No, not my body! Please!
You'll soon want it yourself.
No, have mercy!!
No one's listening, HIYA!!
You monster!!
Then a close-up shot of a rose in a vase, while its
petals fell quietly.
And then the screen blurs and fades out. (Fin)
I found Miki cleaning when I was passing through the
hallway.
My fingertips came close to touching Miki's butt,
but I was only able to graze it.
She used to be so slow and I used to be able
to touch it as much as I wanted.
This is a major problem, Principal!
But my pupil's improvement made me proud. She may
soon surpass her teacher.
I went to club activities for once, and flirted with
Mimi.
She was the same old soothing type.
Lots of other things happened, but overall it was a
good day.
