And now...
Just as Kiri said, the world became clearer.
I also realized that humans can disappear that
easily.
I wouldn't say Adam and Eve, but I wished that the
humans left behind were the ones who were a bit
nearer to perfection.
Those two were in an eternal paradise, but because
they ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they sinned and
became incomplete.
Even so, they still lived a thousand years.
If you read the Bible, it says that as the generations
passed, their lives got shorter.
And now today.
We're here lacking health support.
What was god doing, picking a bunch of scarred
people like us from among the others?
And some like me with dark emotions and bad
intentions.
Well, the world's revolving, I guess.
It would soon recover, right?
Argument 1.
Even if I slaughter everyone, it all resets.
And there's the extra bonus of memory loss.
There were only amusing possibilities in a world
of no development.
I imagined the pleasure of it.
The pleasure fed my desire.
The game had begun.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, you're at the spot where Yutaka died."

She wasn't surprised.
She turned around.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I was a bit surprised she took it so well.

[Kiri]
"With this world where people are gone..."
"All the bad doings were gone... But that meant
the world also became less dense..."
"And still, with all that given, you haven't
changed."

[Taichi]
"..."

I was completely at a loss for words.
She said it like she wanted to fight.

[Kiri]
"...I was thinking of telling you before."
"Why is it that you're alive?"

She drove a stake in my heart.
"Hey, one question...why don't you die now?"
Everything piled up.
The past, the present.
Together.
It was like the blade I threw came back straight at
me.
It was ironic.

[Kiri]
"Do you think you have the right to live?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"You're...evil."

It was an accurate thing to say.

[Kiri]
"You're not human, you don't even look like one.
You're mimicking one...like an insect."
"You imitate, disguise yourself as a human, then
hunt us down."
"You just hurt humans. You'll never be compatible
with us."
"I always wondered why your adaptation score was
80\p, but now it's as clear as day. There's literally
only 20\p human in you."

She was letting it all out.
All the emotions Kiri Sakura was holding back,
now sprung out into a new, shimmering image.
She wanted to hurt me with words as sharp as a
knife.
I thought she only had a dull sword...
But now it seems they'd been her secret weapon!

[Kiri]
"You're a monster."
"The worst part is...that even though you're a
monster, you can't devote yourself to it."
"Do you think people will be sympathetic to you as a
monster and that you'll be able to live peacefully
with us? That you can live along with us?"
"That's not possible."
"In this world, with so little kindness, there's none
left for you. No...there should be none for you."
"It's just like how no host has love for the parasites
eating up its body."
"You're always looking for prey as a sacrifice to
yourself. I know this. You just did well in hiding
your intentions."
"But now, with the world like this, with no people,
you don't have to hold it back anymore."
"There's no more need for you to pretend to be
human."
"You love hurting others, and you always look for
a chance to do that to us. You don't do it right
away, you just bide your time and play with us."
"You're not human, and you're not a monster."
"So what are you? You're nothing, and you should
disappear from this world. That's what I think."
"The dead souls of all the malignant people in the
world combined hold much more value than your life."
"So, here are two things to make you wake up."
"First, even if you think you can be a human by
spending time with us, you're wrong. You can't.
That's blasphemous thinking."
"I know because I've never seen a monster like you."
"Second, don't think you can do whatever you want
with us."
"If you come close to thinking that you can use
one of us as some kind of sacrifice..."

She spoke those final words slowly and deliberately.

[Kiri]
"I'll shoot you dead."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"I won't hand Miki over to you..."
"I won't let you hurt her!"

She stormed past me with determined steps.
The door behind me creaked and closed.
I was all alone.

[Taichi]
"...Monster..."

Monster.
Monster.
Monster.
Kiri's words echoed in my mind as I mulled
them over.
Bitter.
That was the taste I had gifted to me by my brain.
My brain excreted neurotransmitters that created
the taste of bitterness in my mouth.
Monster.
It's an apt word for how I felt about myself.

[Taichi]
"Aww..."

See, it hurts.
My dried out heart started to hurt.
The uncountable segments gave me uncountable
bitter pain.

[Taichi]
"Geez...she didn't have to be so brutal."

I fell to my knees and elbows.
I was dizzy.

[Taichi]
"Ah...ow...ouch."

But, it wasn't a fatal blow.
Kiri's knife didn't really go through my heart.
But it left a small scar on the surface.
There was pain.
But it felt like mere child's play.
Attacks I had taken before were not like this one.
But it seemed like it had been a long while since I
received an attack.
Moderate attacks cause moderate tension.
Almost like intoxication?
I laid down.

[Taichi]
"If you can shoot me to death...please just do it."
"Just take me out of my misery."

I didn't feel...so bad.
