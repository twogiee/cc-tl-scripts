[Tomoki]
"Taichi..."

Someone called out to me as I was walking
down the hall.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're still here?"

[Tomoki]
"Same to you."

Tomoki's face was deadpan.
It felt like a strange distance had come between us.

[Taichi]
"I have club, y'know?"
"I have been going a lot lately."

[Tomoki]
"What's up with that, anyway?"

[Taichi]
"I mean, it's nice to work towards something, right?"

[Tomoki]
"You mean the same pointless stuff as usual?"

The opening of the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting
Club...

[Taichi]
"I don't think it's so pointless."

[Tomoki]
"If you're still sticking with it, then... I mean,
you must have your reasons."
"So who else is in the club?"

[Taichi]
"The club president."

[Tomoki]
"That's it?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Tomoki]
"That doesn't sound much like a club..."

[Taichi]
"I could just be jerking off all day and it's still
a club if I treat it like it is."

[Tomoki]
"I know you've been all over the place lately, but
you never told me it was because of club."

I shrugged.

[Taichi]
"I haven't heard what you've been up to either.
What's going on lately?"

[Tomoki]
"Club."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"
"Wait, did I miss something?"

[Tomoki]
"It's an actual club."
"If you're free, come by sometime."

[Taichi]
"I'm good, thanks..."

[Tomoki]
"She'll turn on you, you know."

He said so disdainfully.

[Taichi]
"Who will?"

[Tomoki]
"The club president."

[Taichi]
"Why would she do that?"

[Tomoki]
"I wouldn't get so close to her if I were you."

Tomoki turned his back to me and left.
He was acting so weird lately.
I didn't get it...
