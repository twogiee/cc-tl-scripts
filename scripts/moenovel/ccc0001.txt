It was the day of the broadcast club camping trip.
We first-years moved up, and the happy 
third-years moved on.
New first-years would be coming in.
New faces joined to fill up the seven.
But actually, there were eight of us.
Seven or eight, either way was fine.
If I called her out... She would come.
Whenever the seven would gather...
The price paid was a steep one.
Despite that, there was not much to gain.
It was more of a loss than anything.
Anger.
Jealousy.
Hatred.
People hurt and divided.
It was that sort of camp.
For one thing, there weren't any faculty members.
It was a private club event.
A little bit of fun to keep secret from the school.
If word had got out, it would have caused quite the
scene.
But I didn't think that would be a problem.
As long as we all behaved ourselves.
As long as she kept guard.
If anything happened, I thought we could just run
away.
What was I trying to do by going that far anyway?
Trying to impress the seniors?
Then the camp ended in tears and misery.
The seven of us hit the road home.
I didn't want to see them.
Too exhausted, tired, and avoided eye contact from
each other.
Almost as if they were strangers.
So I walked in front.
The sun went down as we walked back.
It felt like we were walking for a terribly long
time.
For hours and hours.
It was a walk that usually didn't even take an hour.
Perhaps we were just tired.
No one said anything.
The footsteps of seven people, eight including
myself, that was it. That was the only sound in the
world.
The trail was oddly quiet.
There was not even the faintest sound of insects.
Even the air felt oddly cold...
Although it was still summer.
Although it was dark, I could still see.
I could see the road.
I always had excellent night vision.
Just when I thought we'd taken the wrong path, we
reached the city.
Humanity had ceased to exist.
