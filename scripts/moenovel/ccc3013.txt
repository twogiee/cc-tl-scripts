"It's Friday."

Only three days until the world swung back.
All would be reset without recollection.
Wow, it was cold.
I didn't think it was all too different from death.
This week will only remain in the records.
A week I would never remember.
Never.

"..."

Long ago.
I played this game.
A retro RPG.
It took place in the future.
The world was in ruins, and the people lived in a
dome city.
Animals turned into monsters and attacked humans.
The hero was a monster hunter.
From daily quests, he eventually got the mission
to fight with the one who destroyed the world.
In an RPG, when a character lost in battle, they
were brought back with magic or science.
The hero died numerous times, but as long as the
party wasn't wiped out, nothing catastrophic
happened.
Of course, the subjective memory was saved.
But this was different.
When a character died, not just the hero, it was a
solemn affair.
The remaining characters would return to the city,
and request a clone of the dead and a save point.
The hero would appear just as before,
from the most recent save data.
They would continue their quest without questions.
It was shocking.
No one mentioned the time of the character's death,
after saving the data.
I would play thinking it was the same hero,
but a different person.
It was an unbalanced game, with a high difficulty
setting.
I was haunted by the image of death, but I continued
as if I was possessed.
The ending was a suicide mission.

"What a downer..."

That wasn't something I thought I'd experience.
I wonder how many people have experienced that.
Because I was the fifth one.
But, was that the truth?
If it wasn't recorded, there was no way of knowing.
