I'd successfully killed time.
It was evening now.
I wondered if she was still around.
The heat seemed to have cooled down,
as well as my memory.
The blue sky visible from the roof earlier
had now turned bright red.
No more gusts of wind.
Dusk was as calm as a neutered cat.
No one was around.
I looked for Misato.

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

There she was, right next to the antenna.

[Taichi]
"Found her."

She was sleeping.

[Misato]
"..."

A regular, light breathing.
The sound of her breathing was mysteriously rhythmic
and relaxing.
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out.
Gentle, harmless breathing.
Her plain, natural self.
There was no lie there.
No filth.
Everyone was in a pure state in their sleep.
Still.
Even the brilliant dusk around us couldn't peel my
eyes from her.
I looked at her.
And kept looking.
With envy and aspiration.

[Taichi]
"..."

How long had I been staring?
Her vigorous breathing settled, and her eyelids
moved a bit.
Her long eyelashes trembled bit by bit.
Her eyes opened slightly.

[Taichi]
"Mmm... Nice."

[Misato]
"H-huh...?"

She let out an innocent, child-like voice. Her head
wasn't clear enough to make sense of anything said
to her.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"K-Kurosu?"

[Taichi]
"That'd be Pekke."

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She recited, using her nickname for me.

[Misato]
"N-no..."
"Don't look at my sleeping face..."

She gently moved her body while she covered her eyes
with her arm.
No one wanted to be seen as defenseless.
But we all had something to hide.
The same went for Misato.
But I pushed those cold thoughts away.
She eventually got up.

[Misato]
"How long have you been there?"

[Taichi]
"Since just now."

[Misato]
"Hmm..."

A look of doubt.

[Taichi]
"Really."

I threw up my hands in defeat.

[Taichi]
"I wouldn't lie to you."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"But you ought to be careful falling asleep during
the day."
"You wouldn't want to get dehydrated or get
heat stroke."

[Misato]
"Yeah, you're right."

She tried to prevent herself from yawning.
Her glasses were sliding off.
I subconsciously held my hand out.

[Misato]
"What?"

She held her glasses with both hands, and calmly put
them back in place.

[Taichi]
"There, the usual Misato."

[Misato]
"Jeez, you're so dangerous."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"That right there. That's dangerous, Pekke."

Seemed like she was a little upset.

[Taichi]
"What? How?"

[Misato]
"Look at yourself in the mirror and think about it."

[Taichi]
"Whaaa?!"

I'd probably cry about that later.

[Taichi]
"You mean to say I'm ugly?! Heeey, you know I'm
sensitive about my looks!"

[Misato]
"Um, that's not what I mean..."

[Taichi]
"Ugly... I'm so ugly... Mommy..."

[Misato]
"Ah, no. I didn't mean it like that, okay?"

[Taichi]
"Because my mommy gave birth to this ugly..."

[Misato]
"That's not..."

[Taichi]
"It's okay, I'm hideous. Just a part of mother
nature. A sick ugly male."

[Misato]
"No, that's not true... Well, I was a bit surprised
when I first met you, but..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I was a bit surprised when I first met you.

[Taichi]
"..."

I was a bit surprised when I first met you.

[Taichi]
"..."

I was a bit surprised when I first met you.

[Taichi]
"Hah, hah hah, hrrrggg..."

[Misato]
"Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Grrr?!"
"Beep! Beep! (Alarm)"
"Wrrr, Wrrr, Vrrrnnn! (Lift-off sound)"

[Misato]
"Wah, Pekke is acting strange!"

[Taichi]
"I AM THE CREATOR, HERE TO TAKEOVER 
MANKIND! (Robotic voice)"

[Misato]
"Whoa, Pekke turned into a lame video game boss from
the 80s?!"

[Taichi]
"YOU WISH TO DEFY ME. GIVE IN TO ME
AND HUMANITY WILL HAVE ETERNAL PEACE."

[Misato]
"Question."

[Taichi]
"WHAT IS IT?"

[Misato]
"Why do you speak so cryptically?"

[Taichi]
"GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!"

[Misato]
"Sorry, never mind."

[Taichi]
"PREPARE STAR BUSTER FOR LAUNCH!"

[Misato]
"Yah!"

[Taichi]
"Ugh."
"Huh, where am I?"

[Misato]
"Oh good. You're back."

[Taichi]
"That's odd."

[Misato]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"I dreamed someone said something mean, so I was
going to fire the Star Buster to destroy the human
race, but...I can't remember what set me off."

[Misato]
"I don't think that's what the 'Star' Buster is
for..."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, what was it?"

[Misato]
"You worry too much about your appearance, Pekke.
Your heart is what's important."

[Taichi]
"Appearance...?"

Oh, that's right.
"I was a bit surprised (about how ugly you look)
when I first met you."

[Taichi]
"Arrrggg!"

[Misato]
"Again...?"

[Taichi]
"Geronimo!!!"

[Misato]
"Who?"

[Taichi]
"Ugh..." *sniff*

[Misato]
"What do I do..."

She was speechless.

[Taichi]
"Misato!"

I (purposely) hugged her.

[Misato]
"Uh."

She put her guard up for a moment.
Her hands wandered around in the air.

[Taichi]
"I-I didn't choose to be born ugly. So, I at least
care about my hygiene and try not to make things
unpleasant..." *sob*

[Misato]
"Uhh."

Her body slowly relaxed.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She hugged me softly.

[Taichi]
"..."

I submerged my face into her plump breasts.
Submerged the hell out of them.
I could smell her sweet body odor through her
uniform.
I got dizzy.
I caught a whiff of sweat, too.
But that was also quite pleasant.
And so soft.
It was certainly, endlessly soft.

[Misato]
"Nnh..."

She took a gulp as my face dug in.

[Misato]
"Umm..."

My crocodile tears continued.

[Misato]
"I'm saying..."
"Your eyes are really deep and pretty, despite your
appearance."

I hesitated.
But it dispersed instantly.

[Misato]
"My heart skips a beat when you suddenly come close
to me."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Misato]
"That's why I said look at yourself in the mirror."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"Will you stop crying now?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

It was heartbreaking moving my face from her.
I wasn't sure if I'd ever get another opportunity
like that again.

[Misato]
"Pekke, I didn't know you were such a crybaby."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"You really need someone to take care of you."

My inner thoughts were screaming for her to take
care of me.
Take care of me to the end.

[Misato]
"Do you want to become my little brother?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

Instant answer.

[Taichi]
"All right then, it's decided."

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"I'll pack my things and head to your place
immediately."

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Or should I just go as I am now? Brothers and
sisters sleep in the same bed too, right?"

[Misato]
"Ah, um hey, Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"I've actually been so lonely... Thank you, sis...
No, I'm going to call you my dear sister."

[Misato]
"Wh-what have I done."

She muttered and looked away towards the dusk.

[Taichi]
"I'm kidding."

[Misato]
"..."

Suddenly her facial expression became unfriendly.

[Misato]
"Pekke!"

[Taichi]
"Just trying to lighten the mood."
"Was that not good?"

I flashed her my crocodile tears face.

[Misato]
"Ugh."
"..."

*sigh*

[Misato]
"That's...not fair."

[Taichi]
"Not fair?"

[Misato]
"Just talking to myself!"

She seemed a little upset, but...
It looked like she forgave me.
Misato was really nice.
Night was approaching as we spoke.
And the cheerful moments were gone, and the 
darkness visited.
