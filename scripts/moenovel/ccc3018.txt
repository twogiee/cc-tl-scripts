On the roof top.
Working on the project when...

[Tomoki]
"Club activities huh?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

Tomoki came.

[Tomoki]
"I don't get you, Taichi."

Tomoki said.
But...

[Tomoki]
"But what I understand is...how to connect this
antenna with the mobile equipment."

Now the fun began.
We were making good memories.
Even though it wouldn't last.
I thought about writing those possibilities
in my journal.

[Miki]
"Gooood morning!"

[Taichi]
"Can you go to the room and get some new gloves?"

[Miki]
"Putting me to work already?"

She disappeared into the room.

[Misato]
"Morning."

[Taichi]
"Can you rub my shoulders?"

[Misato]
"Oh, sure."
"Rub rub."

I worked while getting a shoulder massage.

[Misato]
"You're not that stiff."

[Taichi]
"I'm just in a bit of a mood."

[Misato]
"Rub rub."
"Hey, why am I rubbing your shoulders?"

She came to her senses.

[Taichi]
"Just because."

[Kiri]
"I'm here..."

[Taichi]
"Give me a morning kiss."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Misato]
"You can't just demand something like that."

[Taichi]
"Oof!"

It looked light but it was a pretty heavy hit.

[Miki]
"I got the gloves."
"Hm? Is he sleeping?!"
"He makes us work while he sleeps."
"Fine, I sentence him the depants penalty."
"Down they come."

[Misato]
"Hey! You're pulling off his underwear too!"

[Miki]
"Down down down they come."

[Misato]
"Hey! Hey! Stop!"

[Miki]
"Once a girl has gone this far, there's no stopping
her."
"I've just got to keep going."

[Misato]
"You sound just like Pekke..."

[Miki]
"Because we're master and apprentice."
"Kiri, Kiri! Check it out. Can you see anything?"

[Kiri]
"I don't want to see!"

[Miki]
"Look there..."
"Oh! It's out! Something is out!"
"It's out!"

[Misato]
"That's what I said!"

[Kiri]
"Cover it up! I don't want to see!"

What a spectacle?

[Taichi]
"Uh, uuuh..."

They were so loud, they woke me up.

[Miki]
"I can't go anywhere near him!"

[Misato]
"This can't be undone..."

[Kiri]
"Miki, you did it! Take responsibility!"

[Miki]
"That's impossible. I'm a virgin. The senior club
president should handle this!"

[Misato]
"I'm a virgin too! Being your senior doesn't mean
anything!"

[Miki]
"Misato, you haven't done it either...?"

[Kiri]
"M-me too... I just can't..."

[Miki]
"I-I can't do it too, okay!"

They were so loud.
I stood up.
It was a little chilly.
The wind was like needles on my skin.
I wondered if I had a cold.

[Taichi]
"Um, so...?"

All three looked at me at the same time.
And they all startled at once.

[Taichi]
"What's the matter ladies?"

I asked like a gentleman.

[All 3]
"Eeeeeeeeek?!"

The three of them let out an ear-piercing scream.
They ran as fast as they could.
And so I gave chase.

[Taichi]
"What is wrong with you girls?"

[Misato]
"Get away! Stay back! You creep!"

[Taichi]
"Wha...?!"

Rejected.
They rejected me.
I've been rejected once again.
It was my fate to always have people think I'm a
creep.

[Taichi]
"Damn it!"

I bucked up and gave chase.
I felt like crying.

[Taichi]
"Is having white hair really that weird?!"

[Miki]
"It has nothing to do with that! Stay away!"

[Taichi]
"Am I that hideous?!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahahaha! Oh my, it's wiggling!"

She was the only one who looked to be enjoying the
situation.

[Taichi]
"My heart is wobbling in pain!!"

[Kiri]
"Ugh! Gross! Gross! Gross! Gross! Gross!"

[Taichi]
"You hate me that much?!"
"It's one thing to dislike someone for their
personality, but to hate someone because
of their looks is so low!"

I changed my target.

[Taichi]
"Skags!"

[Kiri]
"Oh noooooooo!"

[Taichi]
"Check it out Kiri, I can almost reach you!"

[Miki]
"Oh no, he's assaulting Kiri!"

[Misato]
"You can't go!"

[Miki]
"But Kiri... Kiriiiii!"

[Misato]
"There's no saving her..."

[Miki]
"Don't say that..."

[Misato]
"Let's not waste her sacrifice! Run for it!"

[Miki]
"Kiri... Sorry... We won't forget you."

[Kiri]
"Are you serious? Misato! Miki! You're awful!"

[Taichi]
"Get ready, Kiri!"

I drove her to the fence.

[Kiri]
"Ah, ah, agh..."

She was about to cry.
That just made me more intrigued.

[Kiri]
"Agh... Get away from me you perv!!"

[Taichi]
"Gah!"

Kiri lost it and kicked me.

[Taichi]
"Argh."

As I got up the three of them disappeared into the
school.

[Taichi]
"Uhn uhn...uhn uhn uhn."

I started to cry.
Tears of humiliation.
It was so sad.
Looks wasn't a person's only worth!
They usually said I was cute... It was all lies.
I had white hair. My eyes were different. My nose
kinda curved as well.
I couldn't help it if I looked strange.
But I could change!
Cosmetic surgery and such.
I couldn't really do anything about my eyes and hair.
So... I guess I should just give up.
Sigh.
Being rejected really sucked...
I didn't know why I played the fool.
I just wanted to be loved by everyone, like the hero
in a story.
I exaggerated a bit so perhaps I've become
a caricature of myself.
Perhaps...but...

[Taichi]
"Ooh."

I sobbed.
The world was so cruel.
I hung my head.
It was out.

[Taichi]
"What in the world?!"

My pants and underwear...

[Taichi]
"Whoa, over there?!"

In the place where I fell.
I put them back on.

[Taichi]
"I see... It was because I didn't have pants on..."

I felt a little better.

[Taichi]
"But I can't figure out why I didn't have my pants
on..."

So mysterious.
Could that be said?

[Taichi]
"Those three... They saw me."

I wanted to die.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"When did you get here?!"

[Tomoki]
"Just now. See, this is the spot right?"

They were carrying components.

[Taichi]
"How long have you been watching me...?"

[Tomoki]
"Anyway, what should we do with this?"

[Taichi]
"Are you going to ignore me?"
"Do your job! Put it over there and assemble it!"

Now I was upset.

[Tomoki]
"We're used... We're just being used..."
"What else do we need?"

[Taichi]
"We'll need a battery. There's one at school, right?"

[Tomoki]
"The one we used at camp?"

[Taichi]
"We'll need a tent also. The components are
heat-sensitive and it may rain."

[Sakuraba]
"There are three tents here."

[Taichi]
"Huh?! Where?"

I asked, setting him up.

[Tomoki]
"Sorry, but I see right through you."

Me too.

[Sakuraba]
"Right here...in our pants."

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahah!"

[Tomoki]
"Ahahahah."

[Sakuraba]
"Heheheh."

It was still funny.
We three idiots loved dirty jokes.

[Tomoki]
"Okay, so that's it?"

[Taichi]
"Hm, what?"

[Tomoki]
"Eheheh... It's normally folded up."

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahah!"

[Sakuraba]
"Hahahah."

The jokes kept coming.

[Sakuraba]
"And the height varies person to person."

[Tomoki]
"Eheheh!!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah and there are one-touch tents. Small tents
that inflate at a single touch. It's all over before
you know it."

[Tomoki]
"Eh...eh...!!"

[Sakuraba]
"Oofufu..."

We slapped each other's shoulders and grasped our
stomachs.

[Taichi]
"Patent that!"

[Sakuraba]
"A tent with applied biotechnology."

[Tomoki]
"Oh, my stomach hurts."

[Taichi]
"It'll be a hit and when explained in an interview
how I came up with the idea... I'll say it's from a
dirty joke. Hah!"

I laughed at my own joke.

[Sakuraba]
"Eheheh..."

[Tomoki]
"S-stop... My stomach hurts..."

We caught our breath.

[Taichi]
"Well, let's get an actual tent."

We got back on track.

[Tomoki]
"Ah... That was in last year's budget. Did we end up
buying one?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry... It slipped my mind."

[Tomoki]
"Huh?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yutaka's thing, right...?"

And with that, silence fell.

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, right..."

[Taichi]
"Well, I've got other reasons as well."

[Sakuraba]
"Don't worry about it."
"You can get things done on your own. I believe in
you."

[Taichi]
"You want me to do this all by myself?!"
"What was the point of me sending out postcards?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Trust. What a beautiful word."

[Tomoki]
"That's pretty sneaky of you..."

[Taichi]
"Whatever! Just get the battery and tent!"

[Sakuraba]
"Okay, I'll get the battery."

[Tomoki]
"I have to get the tent? I don't know if I can carry
it alone."

[Taichi]
"Use a car."

[Tomoki]
"I don't have a license... Oh yeah."

[Taichi]
"Heheheh, you won't have a problem even if you get in
an accident."

Using the broadcast station on our own
was already a problem, though.

[Tomoki]
"I want to try driving. I don't know anything about
cars though."

[Taichi]
"A manual transmission car is easier to drive."

[Tomoki]
"Manual?"

[Taichi]
"The kind with three pedals."
"You can find one in the faculty parking lot I bet.
Not one with two pedals. That's not for amateurs."

[Tomoki]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"And you get the battery."

[Sakuraba]
"Yup, leave it to me."
"Just one question."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Sakuraba]
"What does it look like?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, take him with you. Go get both the tent and
battery."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, let's do that..."

Sakuraba wasn't a man who could handle a thing
alone.
The two of them left.

[Taichi]
"All right."

It was almost noon.
I was hungry.
There was Youko's lunch... Two people's worth,
probably.
I should eat it with someone.
No one in the second-year classroom.
I wondered what happened to Touko.
Hadn't she read the postcard?
She was spoiled, so she probably didn't check the
mail herself.
Besides in this world we were in, no one would be
expecting mail anyway.
I'll check up on her later.
First-year classroom.
The poster was in the same place, coincidentally.
No Flowers.
I checked another classroom.
No one.
Each room looked the same.
Even the way the books leaned.
And the next.
Even the blackboard eraser was in the same place.
It was indistinguishable.
But that was just a coincidence, yeah.
Miki and Kiri weren't around either.
They really took off...
Phew, where should I eat?
