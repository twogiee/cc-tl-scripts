"Phew."

There was a note on the table.
"There might be supper for you."

[Taichi]
"Yay, on my way!"

I didn't have to prep it myself.
I changed clothes in three minutes, then rushed over
to her house.
Supper was delicious.
I lit a candle.
The unique light illuminated the room.
I liked candles.
The flame, it attracted me.
My heart was so captured by the flickering flame
that I could doze off forever.
I've burnt my hair because of that before.
Actually, just three minutes ago.

[Taichi]
"It burned... Shoot."

I was about to cry.
Anyhow, the diary.
I opened the thick diary.
Recording life was important, right?
I went to school.
I thought no one would be there, but they all were.
No way was there going to be class, so I just
strolled around.
Touko was especially unsociable. She was probably
tense because she couldn't understand the
circumstances.
Mimi was doing club activities on the roof. She was
putting the abandoned antenna together.
It wasn't as simple as plug-and-play. It was a lot
of work. But that kind of trouble was what saved
her.
I walked down the hallway and saw Miki cleaning.
Maybe Miki had something to clean just like Mimi had
club activities? I couldn't be sure.
Maybe this critical crisis of the world ending had
awoken Miki. But now she had the upper hand on me.
This is a major problem, Principal!
But the improvement of my pupil was truly pleasant.
She may soon surpass me, her teacher.
Lots of other things happened, but overall it was a
good day.
