"Phew."

There was a note on the table.
"There might be supper for you."

[Taichi]
"Yay, on my way!"

I didn't have to prep it myself.
I changed clothes in three minutes, then rushed over
to her house.
Supper was delicious.
I lit a candle.
The lights weren't working.
It was difficult even for me to read and write in
the dark.
The unique light illuminated the room.
I liked candles.
The flame, it attracted me.
My heart was so captured by the flickering flame
that I could doze off forever.
I've burnt my hair because of that before.
Actually, just three minutes ago.

[Taichi]
"It burned... Shoot."

I was about to cry.
Anyhow, I was about to write in my journal.
I opened the notebook.
Keeping records was important.
Because this was the only thing I could be sure of
even when everything rewinds.
