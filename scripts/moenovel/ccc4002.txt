I woke up.
The sunshine pierced through the window.
It seemed like I had a slept soundly. I couldn't
recall a single dream.
The time was...seven o'clock.
There was no need to go to school.
But my body instinctively moved.
There was no breakfast waiting for me.
What else could I have expected?
Mutsumi who was beautiful and hard working, was no
longer here. Neither was her cooking.
She took me in.
And the way she gently took care of Youko...
I had nothing but appreciation for her.
But before I could repay her kindness, she had gone.
There were no decent meals left in this house.
I had only water.
I often met up with Yusa on this street.
I'd become quite fond of her.
She had such a pleasant aura.
I went through a lot to become who I was today.
And Yusa's existence had healed me several times.
But she was no longer around.

[Sakuraba]
"Hey."

It was Sakuraba.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"Same here."

[Sakuraba]
"You too, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Sakuraba]
"It's so miserable."

[Taichi]
"Yup, pretty miserable."
"I usually break into houses at times like these."

We found a nearby house to loot.
...And we were back.

[Taichi]
"What a haul!"

We had found a haul of preserved food.

[Taichi]
"Look, biscuits. And some candies, too!"

[Sakuraba]
*sniff*

Some snot ran from Sakuraba's nose.

[Taichi]
"Seems like it was smart of us to evacuate."

[Sakuraba]
"I could really use a tissue right now."

[Taichi]
"We don't have any."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah. Guess it can't be helped."

We continued along our path.
The snot continued to run from Sakuraba's nose,
dancing back and forth as we walked.

[Taichi]
"All right, just get rid of it!"

I took out my handkerchief.

[Sakuraba]
"Sorry..."

[Taichi]
"I don't need it back, all right? If it's covered in
snot, just keep it."

[Sakuraba]
"I owe you one."

[Taichi]
"Be sure to pay me back."

[Sakuraba]
"Got it."
