"Alrighty..."

It was still before noon so it was still fairly cool.
I went to the rooftop by myself.
I looked up at the antenna and the steel tower that
formed its base.
This was probably something that shouldn't be done
alone.
The antenna showed obvious signs of being assembled
by amateurs.
It looked like some sort of monster of wavelengths
and directivity.

[Taichi]
"Well then..."

I decided to get straight into it.
With expert knowledge equivalent to... Well, none
at all.
Whatever, can't be that hard.
I'd gained bits and pieces of knowledge from Misato.

[Taichi]
"This goes like this... And this like..."

...
...
...

[Taichi]
"Damn, I have no clue."

Taichi Kurosu struggled when it came to
civilization's contraptions.

[Tomoki]
"What are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Well, if I get this antenna going, she'll be like,
'Pekke you're so cool, I'm amazed, you're going
to make me wet!' Then kiss me for sure."

[Tomoki]
"No way would she smooch you."
"Is it for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

Tomoki sluggishly sat down on the ground.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, thanks."

Canned juice.
It wasn't even cold.

[Tomoki]
"What's gotten you all fired up?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, such a naive question to ask."

[Tomoki]
"Does not compute."

[Taichi]
"Hilarious."

[Tomoki]
"Hey, don't try dodging the question. You're the one
who sent this thing..."

Tomoki took out an ordinary looking postcard.

[Taichi]
"I didn't just send it, I personally dropped it into
the mailbox."

[Tomoki]
"Why do you bother with club activities, anyway?"

[Taichi]
"Can I be serious for a moment?"

I put on a serious face.

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"It's to do with you and your...sister.
Is that okay?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It's a serious question."

[Tomoki]
"Okay... What is it?"

[Taichi]
"All right."

Cautiously, I pressed forward with the question.

[Taichi]
"Why do you use Kansai dialect sometimes
even though you're from Kanto?"

[Tomoki]
"That's got nothing to do with my sister at all!!"
"I'm going home..."

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, wait up. Rome wasn't built in a day."

[Tomoki]
"Thanks for nothing, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Don't get too cynical about it."
"It's just that, you know, life is a more fulfilling
when you have an objective to work towards. Don't
you think?"

[Tomoki]
"Fulfilling, huh...?"
"I'm not sure a purpose matters beyond having food
covered."

[Taichi]
"You know... I always wonder about it..."

[Tomoki]
"About what?"

[Taichi]
"Kids that go around in groups putting up
graffiti..."
"I wonder what it feels like?"

[Tomoki]
"Well, hard to say I guess..."

Tomoki stood up and circled the antenna.

[Tomoki]
"Is that all you had to say?"

[Taichi]
"It's cool to have something keep you occupied,
you know."

[Tomoki]
"I already do. Like finding materials."

[Taichi]
"At the very least, this club has hope."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, maybe a hope of being hopeless?"

[Taichi]
"That counts."

[Tomoki]
"I don't understand your thought processes, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Tomoki]
"Why do you always look like you're having so much
fun?"

[Taichi]
"Heheh."

[Tomoki]
"Really, I can't say I understand you."

Tomoki wiped his eyes with his arm.

[Tomoki]
"But what I understand is...how to connect this
antenna with the mobile equipment."

[Taichi]
"Can you do it for me then?"

[Tomoki]
"Hey, you could have at least shown some sort of
reaction to what I said."

[Taichi]
"Idiot. I'm crying inside, right from the bottom of
my heart. Weeping. I'm crying tears of inspiration."

[Tomoki]
"You don't look it."

[Taichi]
"It's awkward having heart to hearts between us
guys. Save those kinds of outpourings for your
sister."

[Tomoki]
"You jerk!"

[Taichi]
"All right, let's get moving! We're going live from
tomorrow."

[Tomoki]
"All right, all right."
"I'll get the materials together."
"...And Taichi?"

Tomoki stopped on his way back to the school
building.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Tomoki]
"I thought for sure you were going to tell me
to make up with my sister. Tell me to help her out
or something since I am her brother after all."

[Taichi]
"Nah, siblings rivalries are part of life. I'm not
going to try and stop that."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"In short, just help me out here."

I puffed my chest out in pride.

[Tomoki]
"You're really something. alright."

[Taichi]
"Guess I'm an outlier cause I got over 80\p on my
adaptation exam."

[Tomoki]
"Hey, we're friends, outlier or not."
"It's not like it makes a difference to me."

He disappeared inside the school building. Almost as
if he had ran away.

[Taichi]
"Makes no difference... HA!"

After saying that, Tomoki had blushed redder than
ever.

[Taichi]
"Geez, you didn't have to say anything if you were
just going to embarrass yourself."

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"But I guess we'll finally make some progress on
this now."

Now the fun would really begin.
We're going to look back on building this as a fond
memory.
We're going to work so that one day we can realize a
dream.
For sure.
Forever.
To be thankful someday.
That's what I was fighting for.
