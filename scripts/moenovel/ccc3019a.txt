I chose to eat at Kiri's desk.
Youko made rice balls today.
It was seasoned, and looked very appetizing.

[Taichi]
"Let's eat."

*munch*

[Kiri]
"Why are you in my seat...?"

[Taichi]
"You're back."

[Kiri]
"Um...that's...my seat..."

[Taichi]
"It is. Have a seat."

[Kiri]
"My seat..."

[Taichi]
"Oh, right. Sorry."

I sat on another chair.
Faced her.

[Kiri]
"Um..."

[Taichi]
"Here, eat. There's enough for two."

[Kiri]
"Miki will bring lunch for me, so..."

[Taichi]
"You can have just a little to tide you over, right?"

[Kiri]
"Sure..."

She reached out.
Success!
Well, Kiri was timid now.

[Taichi]
"Don't touch any knives or weapons, okay?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."
"I don't want to die."

[Taichi]
"That's right. Youko's strong. She walks the walk."

[Kiri]
"Why is she so good at throwing stones?"
"It's so strange."

[Taichi]
"She's good at most things."
"She's fundamentally different from most people."

Youko got the hang of anything right away.

[Kiri]
"Did she go through some special training
or something?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Every time we had a long break, she went
overseas and employed a local military instructor."

[Kiri]
"Military..."

She was speechless.

[Taichi]
"That's probably how she learned to use the sling.
Or maybe she learned it from a real shepherd."
"Does it still hurt?"

[Kiri]
"Not much..."

[Taichi]
"Splendid."
"I'm sure she does lots of other things too."
"Life is just personal training to her."
"I'm a competent martial artist, but nowhere near
her level."

[Kiri]
"You know martial arts?"

Now she was interested.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, Karade."

[Kiri]
"Never heard of it..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"Is it a dollar-store version of Karate?"

[Taichi]
"No, you brat!"

[Kiri]
"Ah!"

[Taichi]
"Um, sorry... I kinda lost it..."

Looking nervous, Kiri jumped back three meters
and looked ready to fight.

[Taichi]
"Come back, I won't bite."

She returned cautiously.

[Taichi]
"Come on, eat. I'm not a bad guy."

I lost myself when she called it fake Karate.

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"She doesn't say but she can probably use small arms
too."
"If it came to martial arts or grappling, she could
kill in an instant. She has many skills and she
recently bought a top-quality knife."

[Kiri]
"S-seriously? For her to kill like that..."

[Taichi]
"Weren't you gonna do the same to me
not too long ago?"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Meh, don't worry about it."

[Kiri]
"Are you okay with that...?"
"I...really don't like you."
"You saved my life, and there's nothing I could do."
"But...that doesn't change the fact that I hate you."

[Taichi]
"Hmph."

[Kiri]
"Don't forget that."

[Taichi]
"I haven't. That's fine with me."

[Kiri]
"Then why be friendly... Eating together..."

[Taichi]
"I just want to see you close up."

[Kiri]
"See what close up...?"

[Taichi]
"You."

I grinned.

[Kiri]
"D-don't tease me!"

She blushed.

[Taichi]
"You don't admire a jewel by touching it."
"You admire it by looking at it."

[Kiri]
"I knew you were like this."
"I can't stand it. If you want to play with girls so
bad, do it with Youko."
"We're not just some play things for you."

[Taichi]
"I can't. She lost herself."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"She's been running away. Always has been."
"It's quite irritating."

Kiri looked as though she saw a ghost.

[Kiri]
"I don't understand your relationship at all..."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

There was nothing happy about our history.

[Taichi]
"So she can't be my plaything."
"It's just too much..."

[Kiri]
"What do you mean?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

I thought about it.
But I couldn't come up with anything appropriate.
Kiri could see through me, so there was no point in
explaining.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you should probably stick by my side."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"I made my point clear but when I'm not looking
she may try to do something to you."
"She may come for your head without me noticing."

Kiri held her neck.

[Kiri]
"M-my head..."

She shook violently.

[Taichi]
"Stick by me, for your own safety."

[Kiri]
"Yeah, I understand, but..."

[Taichi]
"Let's just call it a truce."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"We can bicker in peace, okay?"

I stuck out my left hand.

[Kiri]
"Yeah."

Reluctantly, Kiri stuck out her right hand,
but she still couldn't grasp my hand.
Feeling offended, I pulled my hand back.

[Kiri]
"You're toying with me..."

[Taichi]
"Don't be so sensitive."

I stuck out my right hand again and shook hers.
It was a delicate hand.
It wasn't meant for weapons.
Thanks to Youko's, we kind of made up.

[Taichi]
"We should celebrate this cease-fire."

[Miki]
"Lunch is served!"
"...Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Hey Miki."

[Miki]
"Why are you two together?"

[Taichi]
"I invited her."

[Miki]
"You're scary... An enemy turned into a friend..."

[Taichi]
"I'm just showing courtesy."

[Kiri]
"It's not like that..."

[Miki]
"Whaaaa, you're already eating something! What am I
going to do with all of these?"

Miki dumped the contents of her bag on the desk.
It was a mountain of food.

[Taichi]
"Whooooaaa."
"They're all junk food!"

[Miki]
"Teeheeh."

[Kiri]
"No canned food?"

[Miki]
"All gone."

[Taichi]
"Hm. Having only snacks for lunch...that's rough."

[Miki]
"You think so?"

[Taichi]
"It's not good for you either."

[Miki]
"But I love snacks."

[Kiri]
"Me too, but I'm already full."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, me too."

[Miki]
"Huh..."
"Fine, I'll eat it all by myself."

She got upset.

[Kiri]
"You're gonna get fat..."

[Miki]
"..."
"I don't care, I love snacks."

She started eating the chips.

[Taichi]
"You're just pouting."

[Miki]
"But, but..."

[Kiri]
"Don't cry..."

[Taichi]
"Here, have some rice balls."

That meant there wouldn't be enough for me, but no
biggie.

[Miki]
"Ooooh, home cooked food!"

She clung to my hand holding the rice balls.

[Taichi]
"Huh? You want it?"

I held it up high.

[Miki]
"Oh! Gimme!"

[Taichi]
"Here, here."

To the right.

[Miki]
"Heeeey..."

[Taichi]
"Heya hoya."

To the left.

[Miki]
"Come ooon..."

[Kiri]
"You're teasing her..."

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Miki]
"Ah, it's so delicious!"

She gobbled it down.
The pile of snacks remained.

[Taichi]
"Bad eating habits for a girl. Is she always like
this?"

[Kiri]
"Canned food and breads and such."

[Taichi]
"Eat some vegetables."

[Kiri]
"There aren't any."

[Taichi]
"Here are some tomatoes. There's two just for you."

[Miki]
"Ooooh, tomatoes!"

[Taichi]
"Heh, you want it?"

[Miki]
"Gimme!"

[Taichi]
"Here, here."

To the right.

[Miki]
"Heeeey..."

[Taichi]
"Heya hoya."

To the left.

[Miki]
"Come ooon..."

[Kiri]
"This guy is so mean..."

[Taichi]
"Phew."

[Kiri]
"Hmmmmm."

[Miki]
"It's sour."

[Kiri]
"But it's good..."

[Miki]
"I could cry."

[Kiri]
"It's good to be alive."

[Miki]
"Meow"

What were these two eating every day?
I watched Miki and Kiri eat tomato with puckered
lips from the corner of my eye while I drank from
my water bottle.

[Taichi]
*cough cough!*

She's watching!
She's carefully watching!
Her jealousy was transparent...
For her to make her presence known to me...
Was she insinuating something?
Highly secretive because she was a ninja.
It wasn't like I could find her.

[Miki]
"What's the matter?"

[Taichi]
"We're being watched by the Ichihara-style
of espionage."

[Miki]
"Ichihara?"

[Taichi]
"E. Ichihara was the top female ninja of her clan,
and the proprietor of this spying technique."

[Miki]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"Aaaaaah?!"

Kiri noticed too.

[Kiri]
"Ta-Taichi! Th-there..."

[Taichi]
"No worries, stick by me."

[Kiri]
"Y-yes..."

[Miki]
"Hm? Hm?"

[Kiri]
"H-huh?"

Kiri pointed and Miki tried to figure it out.
Youko wasn't there.

[Miki]
"Huh? There's nothing there. What's up?"

[Kiri]
"She, she was there... I swear."

[Taichi]
"A Shimura phenomenon.
Miki can't physically see Youko."

Taichi Physics:
"Shimura Phenomenon" A type of observational
problem that occurs under specific stable conditions.
People who could see will see, and others can not
due to physical effects. This attribute is lost when
a major change occurs.
Oooh, she was watching...

[Kiri]
"Agh..."

Kiri was so nervous.
She reflexively grabbed my shoulder.
At that, the corner of Youko's eye twitched.
That was extremely rare.

[Kiri]
"Uhn, uhn uhn..."

Kiri was so nervous she didn't notice me getting
close.
Like a cornered cat.

[Taichi]
"Such slender shoulders..."

I loved it, but on the other hand, I wanted to
destroy it.
Those two things existed at the same time.
I let my hand go.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, be careful."

[Kiri]
"What do you mean?"

[Taichi]
"Even if she can't injure you, she may try to
provoke you."

[Kiri]
"Provoke? How?"

[Taichi]
"Umm... I think it'll be pretty grim."
"She could take your dignity, or shame you with a
prank."

[Kiri]
"Just like you, no?"

[Taichi]
"Uh."

[Kiri]
"I knew it... I can't trust you."

Kiri returned to Miki's side.
Aaaah, I lost to the fairer sex.

[Taichi]
"Damn it."

I've got a beef with Miki.

[Miki]
"...Whaaat?"
