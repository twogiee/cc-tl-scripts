[Taichi]
"Okay...let's go."

I decided to go along with her.
She seemed like a friendly ghost.
It didn't seem like going with her would do any
harm.

[Nanaca]
"That's what I'm talking about, Taichi!"

She snapped her fingers in satisfaction.
We walked the mountain trail together.
One foot in front of the other.

[Taichi]
"Are you okay, Nanaca?"

[Nanaca]
"Yeah, I'm totally fine. This walk is a breeze."

There was not a drop of sweat on her.
I guess she was used to working out.

[Taichi]
"Was it over here?"

[Nanaca]
"Yeah, just a little farther."
"Oh, and don't just walk through the bushes, there
could be traps."

[Taichi]
"You mean like, hunting traps?"

[Nanaca]
"Something like that. If you see one, just leave it."

[Taichi]
"What the hell..."
"Oh, here we are."
"So what was it that you wanted...?"

Nanaca had disappeared.

[Taichi]
"Wha? Nanaca?"
"Hey! Nanaca!"
"What in the world? She's just going to leave me
here?"

I didn't really get it.
Well, I was here at the shrine.
The fact that she had brought me here must have
meant something.
Maybe I had to check the shrine?

[Taichi]
"Hm..."

It would be pointless to just leave after coming all
the way out here, so I might as well look around.
I lightly opened the doors of the small shrine.
It was filled with notebooks.

[Taichi]
"Whoaaaa."

I was surprised.
Within the simple, dimly lit room, there were no
monsters, no traditional vases, no swords, no
crystal balls...
Just a pile of notebooks.
Just a stack of student notebooks.

[Taichi]
"..."

I picked one up.
On its binding, I saw a number casually scrawled in
magic marker.
I guess this was a collection of volumes.
I opened the notebook labeled "1" and gave it
a look.
...
...
...
I finished the first passage.

[Taichi]
"Huh..?"
"How is this possible?"

I thought about the possibilities.

[Taichi]
"What is going on here?"

1: There was another personality within me
writing these journals.
2: I had sent these journals here myself, from the
future.
3: Time was repeating itself.

[Taichi]
"I bet it's 3..."

There was something else.
A clue in my writing.

[Taichi]
"The whole world must be repeating!"

It all seemed crazy, but it was the only thing that
made sense.
I was glad I was mentally flexible.
This somehow must be connected to why all the people
in the world had disappeared.

[Taichi]
"But..."

Even looking at these notebooks, they seemed to have
been written in such a strange manner.

[Taichi]
"They all seem to be seeped in hopelessness."

When everything repeated, only the journals would
remain as they were.
And you'd die each time...
Like some kind of video game.

[Taichi]
"..."

For a second, I fell into deep thought.
My mind was filled with guesses, doubts, truths, and
vague conclusions.

[Taichi]
"Hmph."

It seemed like this shrine, and whatever was inside,
was the only thing that didn't get reset.
I looked around carefully.
Nothing stood out.

[Taichi]
"I guess it would be too easy if everything were
laid out right in front of me."

I thought the same of Nanaca's existence.
She was the one who led me here.
Did she know too?
If I were to believe the journals, she had indeed
appeared every time.
She wasn't just any ordinary person either, so it
seemed pretty likely.
I put the notebooks back in the shrine.
It was probably best to leave them here.
Even if I forget them, Youko might still
be able to find them.
Anyone reading the notebooks would surely come to
the same conclusion.

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, the uniform."

I was just reminded of Nanaca's uniform.
It was a design I'd never seen before.
It wasn't from any of the schools around here.
I'd be sure to ask about it, if I were to ever see
her again.
Anyway, back to what I needed to do.
I needed to live and write a journal entry
every day.
Keep recording, and living.
That's what I believed, anyhow.

[Taichi]
"Gotta live life to the fullest."

Somehow I'd become trapped in a loop.
But for me, that wasn't all so bad.
