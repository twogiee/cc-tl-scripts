Coming to the rooftop alone was fine and all.
But what to do...
Oh, there she was.

[Misato]
"Pra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta."

She was practicing for survival games.
She looked great firing an SMG from her hip.
That was the gun she used every year at camp.
Camp. Airsoft. Wireless communications.
BB guns locked and loaded.

[Taichi]
"Why hello there."

[Misato]
"Hm?"

She turned my way.
Water shot out of her SMG.

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

It hit me right in the eyes.
Being an electric water gun, it hit pretty hard.

[Misato]
"Oh, sorry about that."

[Taichi]
"Nah, summer survival games are all about getting
wet."

[Misato]
"Speaking of which, this is a new model... From
before the fall of mankind, that is."

[Taichi]
"Too cold..."
"But hey, there's something I want to talk to you
about."

[Misato]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"It is okay to take a break from the antenna?"

[Misato]
"W-well..."

[Taichi]
"Your pace got affected by Miki's pace, huh?"

[Misato]
"Well she attacked me, so I've gotta fight back..."

And then...

[Miki]
"GI Die!"

Miki yelled her battle cry.

[Taichi]
"I'm no GI!"

I had to return fire.
My gun spewed fire as I attacked.
*Never mind that it was a water gun.

[Taichi]
"Just a dog of war caught in the battle!"

[Miki]
"GI Die!"

[Taichi]
"Stop calling me a GI!"

[Kiri]
"Die!"

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

Uh oh, Kiri was pretty serious here.

[Taichi]
"You gunpowder-snorting monkey...
You're the one who is gonna die!"

[Kiri]
"Ngh... Impudent little..."

[Taichi]
"That's you!"

The firing lines of the water guns crossed.
*Or should I say, we crossed streams.

[Misato]
"You're suspended! Suspended!"

[Miki]
"Whaaa!"

So this would be our club activities again...
Well, you couldn't just ignore the enemy when they
were right in front of you.

[Taichi]
"Ugh! Out of bullets (water)?!"

I started to reload my gun from the ammo belt on my
hip.
It would take exactly ten seconds.

[Kiri]
"Heh..."

Kiri smiled wickedly.
She returned increasingly accurate fire.
I kept low as I ran.
It takes more than that to hit me.
But ten seconds was longer than I thought.
She drew closer for a better shot.
I just finished reloading.
I fired.

[Kiri]
"Huh?!"

Kiri went down! Yes!
I fired again!
It wasn't a direct hit, but it knocked Kiri off
balance.
She stumbled, lost her balance, and completely fell
into the fence.
The fence bent.
With all of her weight on it, Kiri fell along with
the fence as it gave way.

[Taichi]
"Kiri!"

I ran.
Would I make it?
Not at this distance.
I wouldn't make it in time.

[Kiri]
"What the...?"

The metal rattled.
The fence made a scraping sound.
And then it fell.
Kiri, before my eyes...
Suddenly, Miki was there.

[Taichi]
"Hn?!"

She acted quickly.
She reached out and grabbed Kiri's wrist.
Kiri had just barely avoided falling.

[Miki]
"Kiri..."

Miki's arm was bleeding from where the fence had
scratched her.
Kiri still appeared dumbfounded.
...
Miki pulled Kiri up.
Her stupor eventually faded.

[Miki]
"Owwwwww!"

The bleeding was bad.

[Taichi]
"She needs to go to the nurse's room.
Misato, please take care of her."

[Misato]
"Yes."

[Miki]
"Okay! I'll go to the nurses station with Misato!"

[Misato]
"Huh, no. It can't be... Pekke, please."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Miki]
"Well, I might be able to make it on my own."

[Taichi]
"You can't treat your wound yourself, can you?"

[Miki]
"Ouch."

I hated blood, too.

[Taichi]
"Well, we'll figure out something."

[Miki]
"..."

Such beautiful blood.
Our friend had been saved.
My heart didn't throb.
It might be okay.
Just as we left the roof, I saw Kiri collapse from
shock.
The fear came later. As it always did.
