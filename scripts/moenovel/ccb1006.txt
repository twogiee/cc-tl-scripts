There was no one in the classroom as I entered.
Even Touko wasn't at her usual seat.

[Taichi]
"Okay, then."

I took out the composition from my bag.
I had finished it in one night.
Time to turn it in and get a quick okay.
I went to the roof.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She greeted me with suspicion.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Club President."
"Why do you have your arms around your chest?"

[Misato]
"That's..."

Her face turned red.

[Misato]
"Well, I can't remember what happened yesterday."

[Taichi]
"I guess you wouldn't."

[Misato]
"I-it can't be... It can't be!"

[Taichi]
"Wh-what is it?"

She was clearly flustered.

[Misato]
"Hm..."

She looked down in confusion.
She didn't move her arms from her chest.

[Taichi]
"Never mind that, come over here."

I grabbed her wrist and pulled.

[Misato]
"What the?!"

Misato shouted in response.

[Misato]
"STOP IT!!"

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

[Misato]
"Pe..."

[Taichi]
"Pe...?"

[Misato]
"Per..."
"Percussionist!"

[Taichi]
"Percussionist?!"

In my mind, I saw Misato banging on a drum.

[Misato]
"I don't want to be a percussionist, is what I was
going to say."

[Taichi]
"I don't either, I guess."

[Misato]
"We have to be super careful."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."
"I just didn't want you to get heat stroke, so I
moved you to the shade."

[Misato]
"Oh, is that so...? Well, then, let's go with that,
then."

I guess she was pretty sensitive about it.
Anyway, moving on...

[Taichi]
"Honestly, you had too much to drink yesterday."

[Misato]
"Oh, yeah, yeah..."
"Sorry..."

She seemed to wither.

[Taichi]
"You caused quite a scene."

[Misato]
"Are you saying I got so drunk I went nuts?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it wasn't that bad."
"But it was a bit...indecent..."

I was at a loss for words.
I decided not to mention the incident with her bra.

[Misato]
"Hn?!"

Her eyes seemed to form a horizontal X.
I was completely speechless.

[Misato]
"Ahhh!"

[Taichi]
"But, relax. I took care of it, so no one would see
you."

[Misato]
"You did...? Well...then thank you."

She hesitantly bowed her head.

[Misato]
"I just wonder what disgrace I caused..."

[Taichi]
"Do you really want to know?"

[Misato]
"..."

I was lost.
I couldn't tell her, she was so worried.

[Taichi]
"Maybe you should take responsibility?"

[Misato]
"Huh?"

Her eyes grew wide.

[Taichi]
"I was thinking you should take responsibility..."

[Misato]
"Ugh..."
"What kind of thing did I do that I need to take
responsibility for?!"

[Taichi]
"It's hard to tell you, but..."

[Misato]
"No way..."

[Taichi]
"Do you really want to know?"

She just stood there thinking about it with a squint
on her face.
I didn't think that she could handle the fact
that her bra had come loose and I that I stole a
kiss from her.
Yeah... I should keep it to myself.

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"What really happened was..."

I told her a half-assed lie.

[Taichi]
"You took that antenna wire and used it for a naked
limbo dance session here."

[Misato]
"My life is over..."

She sat up, then slumped into a ball.

[Misato]
"Dear sir, in this spring of sleep, how are you
getting along?"

She read out something that sounded like a fictitious
quote.

[Taichi]
"Hey, are you gonna be okay?"

[Misato]
"I seriously can't imagine my life getting any
worse!"

[Taichi]
"You handled it well, though."

[Misato]
"Oh, but my bra..."

[Taichi]
"Are you saying that you didn't go home last night?"

She nodded without speaking.

[Taichi]
"So, are you... Wait, that's how you woke
up, right?"

She nodded again.

[Taichi]
"So..."

*gulp* I swallowed hard.
That means right now...Misato is...
Below Misato's thin, transparent shirt...
I could see that she was n-naked!
Below her...shirt...naked!!
Well, all the girls in the world were naked under
their clothes.
But, this one had no bra on.
Now I understood why she was acting strange.
Her boobs were so big.
I could easily see the shape of them through her
shirt.
My heart began to race.

[Taichi]
"M-maybe you should go home, have a bath, and come
back?"

[Misato]
"Do I smell bad?"
"I was trying to wipe my body clean just using water
at school."

Ahh, I wished I had been there to see that.
Maybe if I had gotten up earlier...
I wondered why I never got to see anything like that.
But such luck would be meaningless.
I was incapable of such eroism.
Taichi Keyword:
"Eroism"
The heroic nature of being a pervert.

[Taichi]
"Just leave it to me."

[Misato]
"Hmm?"

I returned to the classroom.
I got my hand towel out from my bag.

[Taichi]
"Maybe this will do, instead?"

I gave it to her.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She was moved nearly to tears.

[Taichi]
"Have you ever worn a halter-top? If you use this
towel like that, it should cover you up."

[Misato]
"You're such a sweet guy..."

Tears rolled down her face as she took my towel.

[Misato]
"Wait for me okay? Don't move an inch,
or I'll end you!"

[Taichi]
"All right."

She disappeared into the shadows.
I almost felt like going after her, but restrained
myself.

[Taichi]
"..."

I started to wonder what she would be like.

[Taichi]
"..."

Somehow, I couldn't imagine her.
Normally, I would have imagined her body completely.

[Taichi]
"Am I healthy now...? Did the poison come out...?"

No, it must still remain deep inside my heart.
It had grown and changed with me.
It was the only way I could ever describe myself.
Several minutes later...

[Misato]
"Hey Pekke, good morning!!"

Her face was bright when she returned.
And her boobs were still jutting out at me...

[Misato]
"It's such a beautiful summer day. It looks like
it'll still be warm."

[Taichi]
"Ah, I guess so..."

[Misato]
"So what do you want to do this morning?"

[Taichi]
"I came to turn in the composition requested
yesterday."

[Misato]
"Composition? So you wrote the script
for our first transmission?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"Pekke, you're something. I underestimated you."

Her expression was filled with warmth and
admiration.

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm not one to brag..."

I wriggled with content at the compliment.

[Misato]
"Is it all right if I take a look?"

[Taichi]
"Here you go."

[Misato]
"Thanks."

I handed the script over.
Her eyes grew serious.
She skimmed over the paper.

[Taichi]
"..."

It only took her a moment.
And then she lifted her head.
A smile filled her entire face. She looked
like...the Virgin Mother.
The Virgin Mother descended from Heaven.
And haloed in her holy light, she told me this...

[Misato]
"It sucks."

[Taichi]
"Yesssssorry come again?!"

My howl was loud enough to echo over the city.

[Taichi]
"I'll rewrite it..."

[Misato]
"I'll be waiting."

It was time to head back.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

But as we turned to leave, I saw the materials that
were leaning up against the wall slowly begin to
shift.

[Taichi]
"Misato...?"

[Misato]
"Huh?"

She just cocked her head to the side, oblivious to
the danger.
I started to move towards her.

[Taichi]
"Look out!"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

I couldn't make it in time.
Step-ladders, nails, tools, everything...
They all fell towards her at once.
It all came crashing down.

[Misato]
"Hn..."

She woke up.

[Taichi]
"You're okay... I was worried."

[Misato]
"I'm sure..."

[Taichi]
"I'm just glad you're okay..."

[Both]
Taichi: "...My sister."
Misato: "It's not like that..."

[Taichi]
"How heartbreaking."

My voice returned to normal.

[Misato]
"Please tell me what happened."

[Taichi]
"You were injured."
"I brought you here to treat your wounds."
"And you just woke up."

[Misato]
"I was injured?"

[Taichi]
"A little."

[Misato]
"Hmm...?"

I had treated the wounds all over her body.
Her arms were wrapped in bandages.
She had bandages here and there.

[Misato]
"Ow, it hurts all over..."

[Taichi]
"You were hit pretty hard..."

[Misato]
"I was careless..."

[Taichi]
"I'm really glad it wasn't more serious."

[Misato]
"Thanks Pekke, for taking care of me..."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

[Misato]
"Okay, let's head back to club..."

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, don't move!"

I held her still.

[Misato]
"Why not?"

[Taichi]
"You're more or less all right, but..."

I slowly lifted the sheet and her skirt with it.

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Look, these thick thighs of yours were hurt as
well. Why don't you take a break from club, just for
today."

[Misato]
"Uh...uh..."

Her mouth flapped opened and closed.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, you're bleeding."

Blood.

[Taichi]
"Do you want me to put on a new bandage on it?"

She nodded.
I got a fresh bandage and started to dress her
wound.

[Taichi]
"Well, I'll try to..."
"Let's wrap it around your sexy leg..."

[Misato]
"I'll do it myself."

[Taichi]
"No, please, leave it to me."

[Misato]
"Please, let me..."

[Taichi]
"But..."

I looked at her thigh.
The blood was flowing.
It looked bad.

[Taichi]
"But..."

Such beautiful blood.
Flowing out of her.
Red blood.
Red. Red.
I felt dizzy and closed my eyes.
And opened them...
Ahh......
The world was so bleary.
Everything in motion became red.
Easy. All so easy.
My senses strengthened, and the invisible
became visible.
The range of visible light widened.
My vision became hazy, and I became sensitive to
movement.
I suddenly forgot who I was.
I felt my consciousness changing.
Moving.
My bodily sensations became ambiguous.
I lost all sense of where I was and where I was not.
There was a red dot in the middle of my vision.
It was getting closer.
Noise.
Some kind of image was there.
I couldn't make out its features.
I lost all physical sensation.
I felt omnipotent, united with the whole world.
Noise.
What was it?
It sounded like something not of this world.
A red dot.
Ah, yes.
Yes, I knew.
I was mistaken.
I had decided that the things I was seeing
were undoubtedly part of my everyday.
But that could not have been further from the truth.
That contradiction constricted and widened one's
view.
The beast within me knew that its time had come
and awoke with joy.
This beast had built its instincts on laws, impulses,
and sequences not of our modern world.

[Taichi]
"wwwvvww"

That was the sound I made.
Noise.
What...was that?
I focused my consciousness.
I had to hear it.
To decipher it.
To connect it.
To define it.
Of course.
This was the sound.
The same soundwaves that emitted from my mouth.
My senses converged. If I knew the sound, I could
translate it.

Mi#####
Misato#k##ke?#

[Misato]
"Pe#...k##ke?"
"Pek#ke?"
"Pekke...?"

Ah, I see.
Misato Miyasumi.
It was her.
Those were her words.
She was the red.
"You're always alone, aren't you..."
Of course.
"Would you like to join my club?"
I would fend off any attacks.

[Taichi]
"Get away!!"

[Misato]
"Wha?"

My vision became clear.

[Taichi]
"Hn..."

My head hurt.

[Taichi]
"Holy hell, my head..."

What timing...
The red of blood and the setting sun, how awful.
I was about to cry.

[Taichi]
"Man, I really screwed up..."

[Misato]
*sob sob sob*

My Venus, Misato, was crying.

[Taichi]
"Who did this?! Whoever made Misato cry,
show yourself!"

I stood in a fighting stance with my palms open
forward.

[Taichi]
"I will defeat you, using my 'Karade'!"

[Misato]
*sob sob sob sob*

[Taichi]
"Misato, who did this to you?!"

She pointed at me.

[Taichi]
"It's as hard to exercise self-discipline as it is
to spell it!"

[Misato]
"Pekke? Is that you, Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Uh...yes?"

[Misato]
"Ah the normal Pekke is back...!"

[Taichi]
"Your eternal beloved prince will always be Taichi."

I knelt before her.

[Taichi]
"I'll do anything for you with my 'Karade'!"

[Misato]
"I'm not sure exactly what you mean by 'Karade,' but
I don't need any martial art stuff..."
"Pekke, you were like a Robodian just now, I was so
scared."

Misato Keyword:
"Robodian"
Another word for robot.

[Taichi]
"A Taichi-robot?"

[Misato]
"Just like that."

[Taichi]
"I was so confused."

[Misato]
"Are you all right now...?"

She didn't pursue the topic too much.

[Taichi]
"Yes, my dual-boot OS is able to quick boot change
quickly..."

[Misato]
"Mr. Hashizaki has always said that your English
scores are horrible."

[Taichi]
"Well, let's just clean up that blood for now."
