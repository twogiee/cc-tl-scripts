[Taichi]
"I surrender."

[Kiri]
"Move and I'll shoot... Wait, what?"

[Taichi]
"I'm giving in."

I put my hands on the wall and spread my legs
before Kiri could command it.
The prisoner's position.

[Miki]
"Pathetic..."

[Kiri]
"What should we do, Miki?"

[Miki]
"Uhm, I can't think of anything... He looks
so pitiful..."

[Kiri]
"There's nothing to pity about this guy."

[Miki]
"But you're the only one with a weapon Kiri. It's so
one-sided. And it's not something you should point
towards a person..."

[Kiri]
"But..."

[Miki]
"Let's stop, okay?"

[Kiri]
"Okay..."

Kiri looked reluctant.

[Taichi]
"Can I put my hands down?"

[Kiri]
"Go ahead..."

[Taichi]
"Phew, thanks, Miki."

[Miki]
"Ah, no problem."

Such a good girl.
Well then, I'd better pick one and do "that."
