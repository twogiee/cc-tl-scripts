I waited.

[Miki]
"Taichi!"

Miki showed up with Kiri in tow.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Miki]
"Did we keep you waiting?"

[Taichi]
"You don't know how long I've waited to keep you!"

I tried to make a joke out of it.

[Miki]
"Well, it wasn't easy to persuade her. Sorry!"

[Kiri]
"Persuade...? It was more than a persuasion..."

Kiri was oozing with displeasure.

[Miki]
"...Built up sexual tension."

She whispered.

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri calmed down a bit.
I wondered what secrets of Kiri did Miki hold.

[Taichi]
"Where do you want to go?"

[Miki]
"The mountain!"

[Taichi]
"The mountain...?"

[Miki]
"There is a nice view up there. We can see the town."

[Taichi]
"Sounds exhausting. But okay."

[Miki]
"You don't mind, do you, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"You know I can't oppose you..."

[Miki]
"Then let's go!"

Miki hugged my right arm.

[Miki]
"Hey! Don't be shy!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, umm..."

Kiri then hugged Miki's other arm.

[Kiri]
"Yeah, yeah..."

The three of us walked awkwardly.
Our paces differed.
Everyone seemed confused.
Our enthusiasm levels were all over the place.
Yet that made sense, all things considered.

[Taichi]
"So hey, shouldn't I be in the middle?"

[Miki]
"I think this is fine as is."

I made eye contact with Kiri.
Hmph.
She averted her eyes.

[Taichi]
"Well, whatever."

We walked.
Walking with them arm in arm was hard, but I did my
best.

[Miki]
"The day will be behind us if we don't hurry."

[Taichi]
"We should hurry."

[Miki]
"Go! Go!"
