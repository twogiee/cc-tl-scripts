I was on my way home.

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

In the end, it was an uneventful day.
Maybe because I knew about the reset.
I just couldn't get myself going.
And...even at school, I was just not feeling it.
The world was virtually empty.
Eight people hardly constituted a world.
An eternal summer.
We were the ruins of mankind, stuck in a time loop.
Or maybe...we were something else.
I stopped on the hill.
A grove of trees on the side of the road.
I remembered.
I remembered...
Yutaka Shinkawa was gazing at the grove.
I approached and spoke out to him.

[Taichi]
"Something wrong?"

Shinkawa was sweating.
It wasn't a sweat from the summer heat.
He fell back.
Then a car came.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa!"

Shinkawa was hit by the car and killed. That became
my trauma.
...Don't worry, that never happened.

[Taichi]
"Oh, it's the mini-truck from Tazaki Mart."

The gaudy truck passed by slowly at about 30 km per
hour.
The old man waved at me and said, "Thanks."
I was a regular customer after all.
I waved back.

[Taichi]
"Thanks for always having that rare old timers drinks!"

I couldn't say what it was due to copyright
restrictions, but believe me when I say it's a
legendary soft drink.
He was a former train nerd, so I'm sure he extended
that enthusiasm into his business.
I wasn't sure how he got his stock.
Anyway, Shinkawa didn't die.
He was lively as ever.

[Taichi]
"You straddle the line between life and death. If I
hadn't grabbed your arm that gray brain of yours
would have been a gory mess on the asphalt."

He was trembling.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa?"

[Shinkawa]
"Um...sorry."

He came back to his senses.

[Shinkawa]
"Looking at the grove...you know...makes me feel
horribly sick... It's always been like this, but I
don't know why..."

He covered his face and seemed dizzy.
He looked up at the blue sky and gasped.

[Taichi]
"..."

"One of my legs doesn't move much."
I thought of it as a physical disability.
Gunjo did accept the physically disabled but it
was only a select few.
But Yutaka might have been something mental...a
mental illness. Now that I thought about it.
In the forest.
A closed space surrounded by trees.
I wasn't too fond of it either.
Long ago, there was an incident that broke my heart.
That was how I was kind of able to understand, how
Shinkawa was feeling.
