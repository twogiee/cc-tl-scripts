Miki was there.

[Taichi]
"Hey you, first-year."

[Miki]
"Ah, Taichi with actual clothes on."

[Taichi]
"Ugh."

[Miki]
"It's good that you're not on a streak anymore."

[Taichi]
"Don't mention that."
"I don't even know why my lower extremities were
exposed."

[Miki]
"..."

Why was she quiet all of a sudden?

[Taichi]
"Anyhow, what's this cardboard box doing here?"

[Miki]
"Ahh, I was planning on messing around with this
but, now that you know..."
"This is Casa de Mik-"

My arm automatically extended and pinched Miki's
nose.

[Miki]
"Wh-what?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno. My arm just moved on its own."

[Miki]
"It hurts..."

I stared at my own hand.
Then I squeezed it around. Seemed to be no issue.

[Taichi]
"That's strange..."

Oh well.

[Taichi]
"So, this is?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, so this is Casa de Mik-"

My arm moved on its own and squeezed Miki's cheeks.

[Miki]
"Owowowowow!!"

[Taichi]
"Ohh, s-sorry!"

[Miki]
"What are you doing?!"

[Taichi]
"That's weird... I wasn't really trying to do
anything..."

I made sure just in case, but nothing was wrong with
my hand.

[Miki]
"Not the face. Do the body if anything."

[Taichi]
"Ahh, so sorry..."
"So, what is this?"

[Miki]
"It seems best not to talk about this..."

[Taichi]
"I feel the same way."
"We may be crossing a dangerous bridge."

[Miki]
"Let's just call it Miki House."

[Taichi]
"Miki House."

[Miki]
"Miki House, Miki's house... Is there a problem?"

[Taichi]
"Hm. None. None at all."
"So, how do you use it?"

[Miki]
"It's for sneaking around in enemy territory."

[Taichi]
"That's impossible."

[Miki]
"You think so?"

[Taichi]
"A normal young adult would want to peek inside Miki
House and dandily ask if there were any good clothes
for kids."

[Miki]
"Uhh, the only thing available would be what I have
on."

[Taichi]
"How much?"

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"How much would it cost?"

[Miki]
"Why are you saying that so serious all of a sudden?"

[Taichi]
"Because it's the real world. But never mind that."
"How much?"

[Miki]
"Hmm, let's see."

She gave me an impish face.

[Miki]
"Then one million yen. Immediate purchase. For a
limited time only, if you buy it now, I'll take them
off and hand them to you."

I handed her ten gold coins that Sakuraba gave me.

[Taichi]
"That's a deal, immediate purchase."

[Miki]
"Huh, wha...?"

She froze, letting out a confused expression
in the air.

[Taichi]
"Take them off right here."
"It's too bad there's not a picture of the product
worn, but I'll at least photograph the undressing
scene."

I prepared the camera. Good thing we were in the club
room.
And it still had plenty of battery. Good, good.

[Miki]
"Ah, um... What's going on?"

[Taichi]
"100,000 yen gold coins. Guess you don't know about
them."
"The Showa era continued for 60 years being in wars,
in development, and being hated by the world."

[Miki]
"Can you use this?"

[Taichi]
"Not around here, but it's still official currency."
"Now then, I made an immediate purchase. I handed
you the payment. The ball's in your court."

[Miki]
"Ah..."

The terror.

[Taichi]
"If you break this promise... I'll leave a 'very
poor' review."

[Miki]
"No, anything but that!"

[Taichi]
"Then strip."

[Miki]
"Ah, wha, ah... A-anything but..."

[Kiri]
"Wait!"

It was Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Kiri!"

She'll definitely kick me.
I guarded my head.
But.

[Kiri]
"I...will take my clothes off instead."

[Both]
"Whaaaaat?!"

Kiri put both her hands in her skirt.

[Kiri]
*sniffle*

[Taichi]
"Okay okay, it's fine! I take it back!"

[Kiri]
"Are you sure...?"

[Taichi]
"There's no point in making a young lady cry."

Unless, of course, we were by ourselves...

[Miki]
"Thanks, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Miki, I'm glad you're safe."

*shft*
They hugged.
I was the bad guy in this world.
