The sky was as clear and blue as it could be.
It seemed to go on forever.

[Sakuraba]
"Nice weather today."

In the distance, the clouds drifted.
It was as if all the clouds in the atmosphere
were drifting away like a departing ship.

[Sakuraba]
I should...go on an adventure.

Time to explore the world.
The adventure begins now!
But I mustn't forget to bring the necessities.
And to me, there was one great necessity.
So, I made sure to procure it.

[Sakuraba]
"My favorite, curry rolls!"

Phew... Today was the start of the new semester.
I decided to eat some curry rolls first.
Gunjo Gakuin's cafeteria curry rolls.
There was nothing more delicious.
Should they be sold out, it'd be disastrous.
I'd definitely die.
If I couldn't get my hands on them, I'd be no more.
There was never a time I couldn't lay my hands on
them.
Even when all the other rolls were sold out,
the curry roll remained.
It was fate.
The Goddess of Fate was always on my side.
And today she smiled widely at me.

[Sakuraba]
"Whoa, there's even more than usual!"

There had never been so many curry rolls 
in stock before.
The case was packed full, and there were curry rolls
as far as I could see.

[Sakuraba]
"This is some scary-good luck...
There must be more than 256 rolls!"

Of course I hadn't actually counted.
It was like Taichi said before...
Item capacity maxed out at 256.
I trusted Taichi.
I couldn't really explain why, I just did.
Friendship is...not asking anything in return.
In the case, there were a bunch of other unknown
goods mixed in with the curry rolls.
The item capacity was exceeded.
Items must be thrown away until we were within the
item limit.
I'll follow your advice to the word, Taichi.

[Sakuraba]
"Farewell, pork cutlet sandwich! Farewell,
croquette roll! Farewell, fried noodle roll!
And farewell...all items not curry roll!"

I will never forget you...
Leave the rest to me. I'll see you on the other side!
I threw away the impure miscellaneous objects, and
made it case full of curry rolls.

[Sakuraba]
"Phew..."

A feeling of refreshment washed over me.
I always felt good after doing noble deeds.
Now, I could eat the curry rolls with dignity.
The curry rolls that I couldn't eat at camp.
The curry rolls that weren't sold during 
summer break.
Ohhh, my beloved curry rolls.
How did you ever become so wonderful?
Finally, we were together again.
The curry rolls were the universe.
And I was the world.
The universe and the world intersected.
I bit it, chewed it, and tasted it.
I endlessly repeated this process as I went
through the curry cosmos.
Spicy...
The taste of the universe was spicy.
Yet, delicious.
The taste of curry rolls awakened happy memories
within me.
When I first encountered this flavor,
Taichi was by my side.
It was the first time he and I ate lunch together.
What a pleasant memory.
Ever since I started coming to this school,
I had curry rolls every day.
All those memories came to life once more
whenever I ate a curry roll.
To search for the lost memories, I devoured the
curry rolls.
...So full.
...I was becoming full.
...My stomach...my soul...
My spirit was fulfilled...
I should...go on an adventure.
Time to explore the world...with curry rolls.
With a stomach full of curry rolls, I pondered...
About the current situation...
It all started when we came back from camp 
on Sunday.
There was no one in town.
The reason was unknown.
We searched the entire town, and then we came up
with a plan.
Tomoki said he would maintain the food supply and
distribute them among the members.
The club president was set on fixing the antenna on
the rooftop.
So what was there for me to do?
What was there to think about? I'd go search around
for people.
They all vanished.
All humanity was extinct.
Everyone else was too quick in coming to
conclusions.
I couldn't believe it until I saw for myself.
It became dark quickly the day before.
Our search was not thorough.
Wouldn't it make more sense if the townspeople were
actually hiding somewhere?
I know what this is! Candid camera!
Everyone could just be hiding, and planning to
appear out of nowhere.
A grand surprise party.
I had lived overseas, so I knew about these 
kinds of parties.
...It was when I was seven years old.
When I returned home from school, my host family was
nowhere to be seen.
I looked all over the house, but couldn't 
find them anywhere.
And when I got scared, and was nearly crying...
'Surprise!'
They all appeared suddenly,
with party poppers in hand.
We then had cake together.
It was my seventh birthday.
And surely, today was someone else's birthday.
I stopped by Tazaki Mart.

[Sakuraba]
"Parties usually need champagne."

I looked around for champagne.
There wasn't any...

[Sakuraba]
"Sparkling wine would work too."

So, I looked around for sparkling wine.
There wasn't any...
No party hats, no big-nose glasses,
and no party poppers.
This wasn't good.
I couldn't join in the party without those.

[Sakuraba]
"Mr. Tazaki, I wanna be part of the party too.
Please come out and help me."

No response...

[Sakuraba]
"I'm begging you. I'm ready to give up. Please let
me celebrate the birthday with everybody."

Still nothing...
Not even when I beg?
It was a surprise party, right?

[Sakuraba]
"I get it! It's hide-and-seek!"

A town-wide hide-and-seek contest, huh?
We had suddenly become "it" and didn't even realize.
Yeah, that probably happened while...we were out of
town.
When you're absent in elementary school, you don't
realize you've been put on cleaning duty.
When you're absent in middle school, the field day 
events were decided without you.

[Sakuraba]
"I'll rise to that challenge. Wait right there!"

I surreptitiously entered the private residence
and looked for anyone in hiding.

[Sakuraba]
"Pardon the intrusion."

Mustn't forget my manners.
I made sure to remove my shoes at the entryway
before entering as well.

[Sakuraba]
"There you are! Found you!"

It was a bluff...
And my enemy didn't fall for it.

[Sakuraba]
"This is a tough one."

I looked all over the house, but no one 
was to be found.
It was so vexing, I had to eat another curry roll.

[Sakuraba]
"Tastes like tears."

Tears were super-spicy. My tongue was 
prickling in pain.

[Sakuraba]
"Okay, I lose. Here's your prize!"

I placed a curry roll in the entryway.

[Sakuraba]
"Good luck!"

I faced the interior of the house, and the owner who
won, and gave a thumbs-up.
I turned to make my way towards the apartments.
I had an idea of what the area would be like.
Ready or not...
Here I come!
The sound of children's voices in the evening.
Or the curfew jingle playing over the emergency
broadcast speakers.
The smell of dinner wafting from a kitchen.
When I thought hide-and-seek, apartments 
came to mind.
Many homes. Many people.
It was the perfect hiding spot.

[Sakuraba]
"They have to be there..."

I rushed to the scene.

[Sakuraba]
"It's the police! Don't bother resisting!"

I burst into the nearest room.
There was no one inside.

[Sakuraba]
"Too late. The criminals have already fled."
"Door-to-door it is."

I investigated building after building.
There wasn't a single person in any home.
It wasn't as if the rooms were unoccupied.
All the furniture and living goods were in order.
It was simply absent of any life.

[Sakuraba]
"I'm more of a thief than an officer, in this case."

But I didn't steal anything...

[Sakuraba]
"That's right. I'm an officer. I'll solve the
mystery of the serial disappearances."

The scene of the crime was dead silent.
No sign of the criminal.
I prepared myself for a lengthy battle.
I ate another curry roll as I waited for 
someone to appear.
Stakeouts required curry rolls.
An arrow came flying from my blind spot.

[Sakuraba]
"Gwah!!!"

A hit...dead-on...

[Sakuraba]
"What...I can't...die here..."

I could feel the wetness spread over my hands.
The arrow was deeply embedded in my curry roll.

[Sakuraba]
"If I didn't have this curry roll, it would've
killed me..."

The curry roll had saved me.

[Sakuraba]
"Just hold on, hang in there!"

It had given its life for mine.
It was nothing more than curry and bread 
in my hand now.

[Sakuraba]
"Curry rooooooll!!!!"

Officer Curry Roll's time of death, 
September 5th, 6pm.
I needed to avenge it.
I examined the area from which the 
arrow came from.
There was a trap that shot the arrow.
Had the shot been a bit off, I could've died.

[Sakuraba]
"Did the criminal for this disappear too?"

The good guys, the bad guys, they were all gone.
No, they were all playing hide-and-seek...
The evening sun cast long shadows across the
neighborhood.
My own shadow was the first person like figure 
I saw today.
But in the end, I couldn't find a single real person.
This wasn't hide-and-seek, it was some higher
form...of hide-and-seek.
Beats me.
Come to think of it, I hadn't met any
of the other club members yet, either.
Were they hiding as well?
I should explore the school tomorrow.
The weather was nice today.
Man...was I hungry.
I had finished all the curry rolls that I brought
with me from the cafeteria.
I wanted to eat fresh curry rolls.
I hurried back to school.
Tomoki was already there when I arrived.

[Sakuraba]
"How are ya? If you're looking for rolls, 
they're in the case."

[Tomoki]
"I know. It looks like you found them already."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, yesterday. Did you have some?"

[Tomoki]
"There's only curry rolls left. I don't want them.
They're all yours, Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"Oh, I know. But don't you need some
for Curry Roll Maintenance Club?"

[Tomoki]
"Life Maintenance Club."

[Sakuraba]
"I'll donate the curry rolls I found."
"They're my favorite, but I don't wanna hog them."

[Tomoki]
"Nah, it's all right."

[Sakuraba]
"No need to be so reserved. I'm happy to offer them."

[Tomoki]
"I humbly refuse."

[Sakuraba]
"But why? Friendship is..."

[Tomoki]
"Not asking anything in return."
"Your friendship is enough for me. Curry rolls have
always been your thing, Sakuraba. No one will
complain if you have them all."

[Sakuraba]
"No kidding?"

[Tomoki]
"Are you good on food? I still have a little left."

[Sakuraba]
"Nah. Please split mine up with everyone else.
I have these curry rolls."

[Tomoki]
"It's really unhealthy eating the same thing, 
you know."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm fine. I can handle it."

[Tomoki]
"Oh hey, speaking of which, what did you eat 
last night?"

[Sakuraba]
"I had a full-course dinner."

[Tomoki]
"Full-course?! You had food left at home?
Like canned goods or ready-made packets?"

[Sakuraba]
"Well, for hors d'oeuvres..."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah?"

[Sakuraba]
"Curry rolls..."

[Tomoki]
"Your appetizer was curry rolls?!"

[Sakuraba]
"And for salad, curry roll."

[Tomoki]
"You can't possibly call that a salad!"

[Sakuraba]
"It has veggies inside."
"And the soup was..."

[Tomoki]
"I'm guessing a curry roll?"

[Sakuraba]
"What are you, psychic?"

[Tomoki]
"Anyone could've guessed that!"

[Sakuraba]
"The bread was, of course, a curry roll. The seafood
course was also curry roll."

[Tomoki]
"You don't think calling it seafood is a stretch?"

[Sakuraba]
"There is seafood curry."

[Tomoki]
"I'm pretty sure that curry roll doesn't have
seafood curry as a filling..."

[Sakuraba]
"You don't need to fret the details.
For sorbet, I had a curry roll."

[Tomoki]
"Sorbet?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, the course that cleanses the palate."

[Tomoki]
"So basically, everything was curry roll?"

[Sakuraba]
"That's right. All the way through the cheese,
fruit, dessert, coffee, and petit four courses."

[Tomoki]
"Wow...surprisingly, it's not appealing at all."

[Sakuraba]
"You want some?"

[Tomoki]
"As I said, we still have supply of food. Everyone
else's portions are stored in the school kitchen."

[Sakuraba]
"Ah, that's too bad."

[Tomoki]
"If you ever get sick of curry rolls,
we'll give you your portion back."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm good, all I'll ever need is curry rolls."

Tomoki left to look for food.
Seemed pointless to me.
We already had curry rolls here, right?
Tomoki was very active in his new club activities.
It must be very rewarding for him.
I ought to find that kind of activity for myself.
Kirihara was in the hallway.
She wasn't looking so active.
She didn't seem well.

[Sakuraba]
"Kirihara."

[Touko]
"Whuh...?"

[Sakuraba]
"What's up with your face?"

[Touko]
"Are you looking for a fight...?"

[Sakuraba]
"My mistake. Your face looks pale."

I offered her a curry roll.

[Sakuraba]
"Here."

[Touko]
"I don't want it..."

[Sakuraba]
"You'll get cranky if you're too hungry."

[Touko]
"Leave me alone...."

[Sakuraba]
"Kirihara."

[Touko]
"What do you want...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Which do you prefer, Japanese or Chinese food?"

[Touko]
"Italian..."

[Sakuraba]
"Eating western food two days straight doesn't 
sound good..."

[Touko]
"What are you talking about, you idiot?"

Kirihara continued ahead on unsteady feet.
The way she walked showed she wasn't well.

[Sakuraba]
"Is she really all right...?"

I went to Kirihara's class.
There was no one in the room.

[Sakuraba]
"Kirihara's seat is around here, I think."

I shoved as many curry rolls as I could 
into her desk.

[Sakuraba]
"Hmm. Her life should be maintained now."

I was helping Tomoki in his club activities.
In thanks for his preferential distribution.
Friendship is not asking anything in return.
Several of the curry rolls spilled out of the desk.
I guess that amount wouldn't fit in there.

[Sakuraba]
"Too many... I guess I'll have to eat the extras."
"No, wait..."

I was blessed with all these curry rolls.
Kirihara should be fine with this.
But what about everyone else?
Would they be starving, because they didn't have
anything to eat?
The thought brought tears to my eye.
I'd lend a hand to those friends
who weren't as blessed as I was.
A helping hand...
Hand helping what? Now, that's dirty.
I went to the rooftop.
The club president was there.

[Misato]
"Sakuraba... It's been a while since you've 
come here."

[Sakuraba]
"Club President, I came for my club activity."

[Misato]
"Well, you know, the sun is getting strong and I do
have enough people helping..."

[Sakuraba]
"Here."

[Misato]
"A...curry roll?"
"You're handing them out?"

[Sakuraba]
"Please eat it."

[Misato]
"Right here...?"

[Sakuraba]
"..."

I nodded silently to her.

[Misato]
"I...get embarrassed when people watch me eat."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmm...It never embarrasses me."

[Misato]
"Uhh... Okay, just a bite."

She ate the curry roll.

[Misato]
"Ugh, it's spicy, and it tastes a little strange."

[Sakuraba]
"But that's what makes it so good."

[Misato]
"Not really..."

She looked like she was about to cry.

[Sakuraba]
"There are plenty more. Have another."

[Misato]
"Um, I'm already full..."

[Sakuraba]
"All right, good luck with the rest of the 
club work!"

I solved the broadcast club's food crisis.
Sakura and Yamanobe were in the 
first-year's classroom.
They were laying out snacks.

[Miki]
"Sakuraba! It's been a while!"

[Kiri]
"Hello."

[Sakuraba]
"Here, take these."

I handed them a curry roll.

[Kiri]
"Ummm..."

[Miki]
"Is this a snack exchange?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm just giving them out, no need to 
return the favor."

[Miki]
"Even so... These are the cafeteria curry rolls,
right?"

[Kiri]
"Are they? No thanks then, I'll pass."

[Miki]
"I don't want them either."

[Sakuraba]
"C'mon. There's plenty."

I dumped out my treasure trove of curry rolls
onto the desk.

[Sakuraba]
"Eating nothing but snacks is bad for your health."

[Miki]
"Kiri made lunch, so we're fine."

[Sakuraba]
"You made these?"

[Kiri]
"They're ready-made... I just cooked the rice."

[Sakuraba]
"That's amazing."

[Kiri]
"It's nothing special."

[Sakuraba]
"My parents never let me do anything like that."

[Kiri]
"Really...?"

[Sakuraba]
"They said sharp objects and fire was too dangerous."

[Miki]
"I didn't know that. You must have had a hard time."

[Sakuraba]
"Nah, my parents were just worried, that's all."

[Kiri]
"Isn't that a little overprotective...?"

Seemed like these two were fine, no need to worry.
I went to the cafeteria, and Taichi was there.

[Taichi]
"Hey Sakuraba. Did you eat?"

[Sakuraba]
"About to have some curry rolls. Want some?"

[Taichi]
"Nah."

[Sakuraba]
"Don't worry about me. There's plenty left."

[Taichi]
"I never worry about you."

[Sakuraba]
"Then go ahead, have one."

[Taichi]
"I have a sandwich already. Its handmade by Youko."

[Sakuraba]
"How charming..."

[Taichi]
"There's enough for two, let's eat."

[Sakuraba]
"Nah... As long as I have curry rolls, that's what
I'll eat."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Sakuraba]
"I spent all of yesterday looking for townsfolk, but
I couldn't find anyone. Now, no one in this world
can make curry rolls. It's lost technology."

[Taichi]
"Curry rolls disappeared with mankind..."

[Sakuraba]
"Don't be so quick to write them off.
Sooner or later they'll be back.
My prediction is one week."

[Taichi]
"You sound so certain. Do you know something?"

[Sakuraba]
"I know it's perfect in theory."

[Taichi]
"I get the distinct impression that you're going to
start talking nonsense."

[Sakuraba]
"Oh really? Then I'll keep my mouth shut.
I'll take my secrets to the grave."

[Taichi]
"Out with it... You've got my interest."

[Sakuraba]
"All right. Listen carefully."
"We eight have been displaced."

[Taichi]
"Displaced?"

[Sakuraba]
"And someone took our place."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, okay, and?"

[Sakuraba]
"That's all."

[Taichi]
"I don't understand a word of what you just said."

[Sakuraba]
"Do you think I can possibly explain it any better?"

[Taichi]
"I do not."

[Sakuraba]
"We went camping for a week."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Sakuraba]
"All the people in town went on a camping trip as
soon as we came back. We just missed them."
"Be happy, Taichi! Theoretically, the townsfolk
should all return from camp in a week."

[Taichi]
"That's quite a theory."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmm. You flatter me."

[Taichi]
"So according to your theory, you can eat more curry
rolls in a week?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm prepared for the worst. Should they get lost,
or have too much fun and not want to come back...
Who knows what can happen when people travel."

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba... You'll live a long life for sure."

[Sakuraba]
"Is that so? I'm glad to hear it."

Taichi ate his sandwich, and I ate my curry roll.
Afterwards, I searched the city, but no one was to
be found.
No signs of anyone hiding either.

[Sakuraba]
"They must be traveling..."

To somewhere not here.
To someplace unknown.
To some new unseen land.
A powerful urge stirred them, which made them go on
their journey.
That's the kind of person I am.
The others laughed at me.
They said I was strange.
But then one day, it awoke within them too.
So they left for someplace beyond the mountains.
It made me jealous.
Why was I still here?
Why am I still in town?
When morning came, I went to the school and loaded
up on curry rolls.
That had become my daily routine.
No, it had been my routine long before then.
I would arrive at school and buy a curry roll 
before class.
Otherwise, I'd feel horrible if they were sold out.
First, I'd buy one for breakfast.

[Sakuraba]
"Hm...?"

It tastes different.
It felt as if the joy of eating curry rolls
was gone.

[Sakuraba]
"There is no way I could be tired of curry rolls..."

I was shocked.

[Sakuraba]
"No wait, here's what it is..."

It's said that curry tastes better on the second day.
Curry's exceptional when you let it sit overnight.

[Sakuraba]
"It's gotta ripen... It should be ready 
by day three."

It was a new discovery.

[Tomoki]
"It's going bad, because of the heat."

[Sakuraba]
"Not at all. It gives it a mellow taste."

[Tomoki]
"The bread's fine, but the curry inside..."

[Sakuraba]
"It's fine."

[Tomoki]
"There are no doctors, so make sure to 
take care of yourself."

[Sakuraba]
"I will."

Tomoki diligently handled the cardboard box
while I continued to eat my curry roll.

[Sakuraba]
"I'll help ya."

[Tomoki]
"Thanks."

[Sakuraba]
"It's no problem. I don't have anything else to do."
"Friendship is..."

[Tomoki]
"Not asking anything in return."

I helped Tomoki with the boxes.

[Sakuraba]
"What's in this?"

[Tomoki]
"It's the food I gathered. I was gonna hand them out
to everyone, because there's perishable and goods
that are about to expire in here."

[Sakuraba]
"I'll distribute the curry rolls."

[Tomoki]
"No one wants spoiled food."

[Sakuraba]
"Curry rolls ripen, not spoil. Just like women as
they get older."

[Tomoki]
"I'm not interested in older women."

Once we finished carrying the boxes, we started
separating the portions.

[Sakuraba]
"You're gonna hand these out to everyone?
You're like Santa Claus."

[Tomoki]
"December's still pretty far off."

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, sorry Tomoki, but I have business to 
take care of."

[Tomoki]
"No worries. All I have to do is hand it out
everyone so go ahead."

I entrusted Tomoki with the task.
I wanted to be that Santa Claus to the townsfolks.
I entered a nearby house.
This house looks familiar...

[Sakuraba]
"I remember this house!"

This was the house I had searched for people
the day before yesterday.
I had placed a curry roll in the entryway...

[Sakuraba]
"It's gone. How can that be...?"

The curry roll had disappeared without a trace.
Did someone in hiding eat it?
Not just the people, but were the curry rolls
disappearing too?

[Sakuraba]
"Surely someone must have enjoyed it.
That's what I choose to believe."

I became the Santa who gave curry rolls
to all the good boys and girls.
By the time I finished distributing the curry rolls
it was already night.
I carried the box and went over to Taichi's house.
I slowly opened the door to the entryway.
No hesitation at all.
That's the kind of person I am.
Taichi and Tomoki were there.

[Tomoki]
"Here is your portion of food supply, Taichi."

Tomoki left the cardboard box in the entryway.

[Taichi]
"Oh hey Rubber, you came too."

Tomoki looked at my cardboard box.

[Tomoki]
"Oh, did you come to help distributing? Looks like
our duties overlapped."

[Sakuraba]
"No. Here is a present from Santa."

[Tomoki]
"Huh...? Whaddya mean?"

[Sakuraba]
"Even though food will fill your stomach,
they won't necessarily satisfy your soul."

I opened the box that I brought with me.

[Taichi]
"Videotapes...?"

[Sakuraba]
"I found a small local shop while I was searching
the town. I borrowed these from there."
"I figured since we're so bored everyday..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"The dazzling world of the adult, and all of its
flesh-toned heavenliness, lie within."

[Taichi]
"You idiot. How are we going to watch these?"

[Sakuraba]
"You can pause it, marathon it, replay it in your
memory... Everyone's got their own way. Do it
however you like."

[Taichi]
"We have no electricity..."

[Sakuraba]
"Oh yeah, you're right."

[Taichi]
"How could you have not realized that?!"

[Sakuraba]
"So if we had electricity, we'd be fine, right?"

[Taichi]
"Something like a personal generator, yeah."

[Tomoki]
"Revving one up to rub one out..."

[Sakuraba]
"It's like recycled energy, it's good for the
environment."

[Taichi]
"You're a total idiot."

[Sakuraba]
"My bad. You can just look at the pictures
of giant tits on the package instead."

[Taichi]
"Maybe that'll do the trick... I mean, we don't 
have a choice."

[Sakuraba]
"Use your imagination to fill in from there."

[Taichi]
"I'm confident in fantasizing."

[Sakuraba]
"Hm... The Fantasize Maintenance Club is born."

[Taichi]
"What a fantastic club to be made."

[Tomoki]
"You're both total idiots..."

[Taichi]
"All right, let's go find some sister genres 
for Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"You're way off the mark. I prefer the 
neat and tidy type."

I am happy to see them having fun.
I was filled to the brim with the Santa spirit.

[Sakuraba]
"A sexy Santa."

[Tomoki]
"You mean cosplay?"

[Taichi]
"Sexy Santa dress with nothing under?"

[Sakuraba]
"I mean I've become a sexy Santa."

[Tomoki]
"Oh really...?"

[Taichi]
"Knock it off. You're putting horrible ideas in 
our heads."

[Tomoki]
"Ugh, like a stark-naked Sakuraba in a Santa..."

[Taichi]
"Don't say it! Words give the idea power!"

[Tomoki]
"It's stuck in my head, I can't get rid of it!"

[Taichi]
"If we see a sexy actress's photo,
it'll purge the image!"

The two of them feverishly began flipping 
over videotapes.

[Tomoki]
"A normal movie...?"

[Sakuraba]
"They were on clearance. I bought all of them."

[Tomoki]
"You bought them?"

[Sakuraba]
"I left my payment at the store."

[Taichi]
"How nice of you."

[Sakuraba]
"But I couldn't get my change."

[Taichi]
"You never will."

[Tomoki]
"I've seen this movie on TV before. 'Stand B--'"

[Taichi]
"Don't say the title!"

[Tomoki]
"I only know this one by name. 'Thelma & Lu--'"

[Taichi]
"Cut it out!"

[Tomoki]
"'Easy Ri--'"

[Taichi]
"You're just screwing with us now!"

[Tomoki]
"But you love copyright jokes, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"You amateurs... If you wanna force that joke,
you'll need supreme technique like me. What'll you
do when if we get sued?"

[Tomoki]
"Humans are extinct and you're worried
about getting sued?"

[Taichi]
"Don't underestimate the litigious might of the U.S."

[Tomoki]
"That aside, how did you choose these?"

[Taichi]
"They're all road movies...is this what you like
Sakuraba?"

[Sakuraba]
"I don't like movies. The stories are too complex."

[Taichi]
"That's Sakuraba for ya. I was going to punch him if
he started talking highly about his movie hobby."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm fine with road movies. They make me feel like
I'm on a journey as well."

[Tomoki]
"Only in feeling?"

[Sakuraba]
"I couldn't care less about the story though."

[Taichi]
"You're a weird one."

[Tomoki]
"Meh, people come in all types."

[Sakuraba]
"Everyone lives in their own world."

[Taichi]
"Like people with big tits and has glasses or an
immoral sister complex."

[Tomoki]
"Again, you're way off the mark."

It had been a while since I got to just hang out
and make noise with my friends.
This wasn't so bad at all.
The next day, I came upon a very serious situation.

[Sakuraba]
"There are no more curry rolls..."
"Tomoki, do you know what happened to 
my curry rolls?"

[Tomoki]
"Didn't you eat them all?"

[Sakuraba]
"No, not all of them."

[Tomoki]
"I think you're the only one who eats them,
Sakuraba..."

[Sakuraba]
"I handed them out all over town yesterday."

[Tomoki]
"Well... That must be why they're all gone."

[Sakuraba]
"So, they're all gone?"

[Tomoki]
"Isn't that obvious?"

[Sakuraba]
"The baker hasn't returned from the trip to
restock?"

[Tomoki]
"Not yet."

[Sakuraba]
"Can I get some of those cafeteria curry rolls,
Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"Not possible... You'll have to collect
the curry rolls you handed out."

[Sakuraba]
"But I gave them away. I can't possibly 
take them back."

[Tomoki]
"Then you'll just have to give up. They were going
bad anyway, so it was good that you 
got rid of them."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Tomoki]
"I still have food stored so go on and take your
portion."

[Sakuraba]
"Is that all right?"

[Tomoki]
"Take whatever you like. I'm gonna go resupply."

Tomoki left, and I checked out the supply.
There were no curry rolls...

[Sakuraba]
"I guess I'll cook something."

A day had passed.

[Taichi]
"Hey, I smelled something yummy from the hallway. 
Is there food?"

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi...?" *yawn*

[Taichi]
"Whoa, you look dead tired."

[Sakuraba]
"I stayed up all night cooking."

Taichi eyed the food on the tabletop.

[Taichi]
"Curry? Seems pretty authentic."

[Sakuraba]
"It took a whole day to cook."

[Taichi]
"It looks pretty good."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, but it's a failed batch."

[Taichi]
"Failed? Even so, it seems so delicious."

[Sakuraba]
"It doesn't taste like the cafeteria curry rolls."

[Taichi]
"That's fine. I'll eat it if it's a failure.
I'm pretty hungry."

[Sakuraba]
"Sure, I don't need it anymore."

[Taichi]
"Mmmm, thanks for the meal!"

Taichi took a bite of the curry.

[Taichi]
"This is good, you know...? No, it's really good."

[Sakuraba]
"I don't like it."

[Taichi]
"Is this naan? This is really good too!"

[Sakuraba]
"I don't want naan. I want bread."

[Taichi]
"This is more like a Michelin-star meal than a
home-cooked one. I never knew you had this 
kinda talent..."

[Tomoki]
"You two are up early today."

[Sakuraba]
"Did you find more food?"

[Tomoki]
"Only a bit. It looks like we've cleaned out
all of the nearby places."

[Sakuraba]
"Really? That's no good."

[Tomoki]
"We still have emergency provisions,
we're fine for now."

[Taichi]
"Try this curry Tomoki, it's amazing.
Sakuraba made it."

[Tomoki]
"Sakuraba did?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's a failed batch."

[Tomoki]
"Huh?!"

[Taichi]
"Try it, Sakuraba says it's a failure,
but it's just right to me."

[Tomoki]
"I see what you're saying..."

Tomoki tried the curry as well.

[Tomoki]
"Whoa... This is pretty good!"

[Taichi]
"I wanna eat some more. Can I get another plate?"

[Sakuraba]
"That was all of it."

[Taichi]
"It wasn't nearly enough. Do you have anything,
Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"Can't be helped, I guess. I'll hand out the supply
for today."

Tomoki headed to the kitchen.

[Tomoki]
"What...the hell...happened?"

Tomoki immediately came back.

[Tomoki]
"What the hell, Sakuraba!"

[Taichi]
"What's wrong, Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"The food's gone...all of it."

[Taichi]
"Say what?!"

[Tomoki]
"Who would do such a thing..."

[Sakuraba]
"I used it all."

[Tomoki]
"You somehow used it all? Everything?
Every last bite?"

[Sakuraba]
"I was trying to make curry rolls."

[Tomoki]
"You even used the cucumber and the canned mackerel?
And the instant food and the ready-made stuff?"

[Sakuraba]
"Don't treat me like I'm a thoughtless child.
I portioned it out."

[Tomoki]
"Well that's good. Where did you put the portions?"

[Sakuraba]
"I cooked them in curry portions and bread portions."

[Tomoki]
"Oh... So, you did use it all?"

[Sakuraba]
"Well, curry has many ingredients cooked together."

[Tomoki]
"So you're saying you used it all!"

[Sakuraba]
"Cooking curry in large portions
makes it more delicious."

[Taichi]
"Wait, so, that curry we just ate... All of the
ingredients were cooked together?! How the hell did
you make it so good?!"

[Tomoki]
"You're asking the wrong question, Taichi."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmph... I'm no genius chef. No matter how many
times I tried, I couldn't recreate the 
curry roll flavor."

[Tomoki]
"So you really did use all of the food supplies?"

[Sakuraba]
"I threw away the other failures."

[Taichi]
"What a waste! Your failures are masterpieces!"

[Sakuraba]
"That one was ready-made."

[Taichi]
"Come again...?"

[Sakuraba]
"When I started running out of ingredients,
I tried mixing in the ready-made stuff.
It tasted like something from a famous hotel."

[Taichi]
"A high-grade ready-made should taste that good."

[Sakuraba]
"But... It was nowhere near the taste 
I was looking for."

[Taichi]
"Give it up with the curry roll flavor!"

[Tomoki]
"You're unbelievable. I worked my ass off to collect
those foods."

[Sakuraba]
"I may have cooked it all, but it was you two who
ate it all."

[Taichi]
"Don't start blaming other people now!"

[Sakuraba]
"I got it. I'll leave..."

[Taichi]
"Don't start running away, either!"

[Tomoki]
"We'll never forgive you if you don't take
responsibility for this."

[Sakuraba]
"Understood."

[Taichi]
"So, what do we do?"

[Tomoki]
"This is bad. Everyone started depending on me after
I first distributed the food supplies. They were
relieved that we had plenty of food..."

[Sakuraba]
"I understand. I'll tell them the truth."

[Taichi]
"That could make things worse."

[Sakuraba]
"How?"

[Taichi]
"We shouldn't get everyone more worried."

[Tomoki]
"They're calm for now, but we are 
students of Gunjo."

[Taichi]
"That's right. Let's change locations. It could be
trouble if someone finds out about this."

We held our strategy meeting at Taichi's room.

[Sakuraba]
"We'll need a name for the plan first."

[Tomoki]
"'The Provision Plan' is more than fine."

[Sakuraba]
"It's so plain."

[Taichi]
"Too plain."

[Tomoki]
"It doesn't matter! Let's not waste time on such a
useless point!"

[Taichi]
"Don't get so grumpy. We'll be fine
once we collect more food, right?"

[Tomoki]
"You say that, but I've already searched
every place I can imagine."

[Taichi]
"So we need to travel further out to find more?"

[Sakuraba]
"All right, let's go on an adventure."

[Tomoki]
"That again?"

[Sakuraba]
"There are many types of food in this world
that we don't know about."

[Tomoki]
"But how do we travel in our current state?"

[Sakuraba]
"We can go to the next town over,
and take the train from there."

[Tomoki]
"The trains aren't running anymore."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Sakuraba]
"Awww, but I wanted to take a train trip..."

[Taichi]
"Never mind that. Let's gather the food from the
next town over!"

[Tomoki]
"You mean going over the mountains?"

[Taichi]
"There's a city on the other side.
It should have everything we need."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, like a giant rental shop."

[Taichi]
"Are you gonna go?"

[Tomoki]
"You wanna do it?"

[Sakuraba]
"Are you waiting for some dirty euphemism?"

[Taichi]
"Not at all!"

[Tomoki]
"Don't worry about Sakuraba, let's go!"

[Sakuraba]
"No, I'm coming too! It sounds like an adventure!"

[Taichi]
"So we're decided."

[Tomoki]
"If we're gonna cross the mountains,
we need to prepare."

[Sakuraba]
"No need, let's just go."

[Tomoki]
"Do you remember what happened the last time you
went over the mountains?"

[Sakuraba]
"No disaster happened. I only got lost and 
got rescued."

[Tomoki]
"I'd call that a disaster."

[Taichi]
"Hold on. There's a problem... Agh, I forgot."

[Tomoki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Youko told me we can't go to the power plant."

[Tomoki]
"We can't go? Because of a landslide or something?"

[Taichi]
"She didn't say. But for whatever reason, Youko
couldn't even go."

[Tomoki]
"Even for Hasekura it was impossible?"

[Taichi]
"So if we went...it'd be a rough trip."

[Tomoki]
"Definitely, not something we can handle."

[Sakuraba]
"You're wrong. This is our chance to become 
a legend."

[Tomoki]
"A legendary disaster..."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm telling you, that wasn't a disaster."

[Tomoki]
"So what should we do? Should we give up?"

[Taichi]
"I have an idea. Meet me at school 
tomorrow morning."

[Sakuraba]
"Setting out on an adventure, I'm excited!"

The morning to begin our journey had come.
Time to depart on our adventure.

[Tomoki]
"G'morning. Thanks for coming so early."

[Sakuraba]
"It's my responsibility."

[Tomoki]
"Are you talking about the food supply?
I mean, what's done is done."

[Sakuraba]
"I was so excited last night that I couldn't sleep."

[Tomoki]
"What are you a kid? Can you please feel more
responsible for this matter..."

[Sakuraba]
"I do feel responsible. That's why I was up 
all night."

[Tomoki]
"Are you okay like that? And empty-handed on 
top of that..."

[Sakuraba]
"You've got a lot of baggage, Tomoki.
Are you running away from home?"

[Tomoki]
"It's a mountain-climbing backpack. Since we're
going to gather food supply."

[Sakuraba]
"All I need are these two hands."

[Tomoki]
"It should be fine. There should be a sports shop in
the city, you can get something there."

[Taichi]
"Mornin'. You're here early."

[Tomoki]
"You too, Taichi... Do you plan to cross
the mountain in that light wear?"

[Taichi]
"Did I ever say we're going to climb the mountain?
Youko said she couldn't make it, so it's impossible
for us."

[Tomoki]
"You said you thought of something good, though."

[Taichi]
"Slow and steady wins the race. We'll take a wide
detour and cross the ridge."

[Sakuraba]
"I've challenged that route before on my new bike.
Leave it to me."

[Tomoki]
"You failed that challenge."

[Sakuraba]
"It'll be my revenge. I'll conquer the ridge 
this time."

[Tomoki]
"That doesn't sound like a very good idea."

[Taichi]
"We're not using a bike. We're going by car."

Taichi pulled a car key from his pocket
and showed it off.

[Taichi]
"You know there are cars at the staff parking lot?"

We followed Taichi to the parking lot.
There were several faculty cars lined up there.

[Taichi]
"Which one do we take? We've got a bunch to 
choose from."

[Tomoki]
"Are you gonna drive, Taichi? Do you have a license?"

[Taichi]
"How could I possibly have one?"
"I do, however, have astounding driving technique."

[Tomoki]
"And when did you learn that?"

[Taichi]
"I learned it from a video game, asshole!"

[Tomoki]
"But you're ass at racing games, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"What did you say to me, sister complex?"

[Tomoki]
"That's got nothing to do with this."

[Taichi]
"So what, you won't ride if I drive?"

[Tomoki]
"I'd rather drive myself than ride with you!"

[Sakuraba]
"There's no need to fight over this. There's more
than one car."

[Taichi]
"All right, it's a race then."

[Tomoki]
"To the next town over."

[Sakuraba]
"This took a turn for the worse..."

Within ten-odd minutes, the parking lot had turned
into a scrap yard.
Up-endings, rear-end collisions, wheels off axles,
head-on collisions, rolls... It was a museum of
auto-accidents.

[Sakuraba]
"You both still have a long way to go..."

[Taichi]
"I guess I've lost my touch..."

[Tomoki]
"I think I've got the hang of it. I'll get the next
one for sure."

[Taichi]
"There's no next for you, Tomoki. All that's left is
the principal's Ferrari. That's no car for
a beginner."

[Tomoki]
"Your accidents are just getting
worse and worse, Taichi."

[Sakuraba]
"Let's stop this. We're gonna hurt ourselves 
at this rate."
"That's not a car that can be handled by amateurs."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"What about you, Rubber?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, all you've done is complain so far,
can you drive?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's pretty easy. Too easy, actually."

[Taichi]
"All right then, show us."

[Tomoki]
"If you're telling the truth, we'll leave the
driving to you."

The Ferrari key was pushed into my hand.

[Sakuraba]
"I don't really like cars."

[Tomoki]
"But you just said it was easy!"

[Sakuraba]
"I said they're too easy, and it doesn't feel like
I'm doing anything."

[Taichi]
"C'mon, show us what you got!"

[Tomoki]
"Prove it!"

[Sakuraba]
"Hmph... I guess I've got no choice."

I got into the Ferrari.

[Tomoki]
"He started it up on the first try!"

[Taichi]
"And he didn't stall out or anything!"

It wasn't anything special to me.
I had a bunch of Ferraris at home.
And lots of space to drive them.
I've driven so many cars.

[Sakuraba]
"Punch it!"

I cranked that horse into high gear.
I casually swerved between the wrecked cars.

[Taichi]
"Whoa..."

[Tomoki]
"He actually can drive..."

I did a quick lap around the school, then pulled
back into the parking lot.
It was all too easy.

[Sakuraba]
"Something extra..."

[Taichi]
"He...he's skiing the Ferrari!"

[Tomoki]
"Amazing! He handles it so smoothly!"

[Taichi]
"He actually has astounding driving technique..."

[Tomoki]
"For real..."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmph... I'm not finished."

I drove straight towards the cars Taichi and Tomoki
had wrecked.

[Tomoki]
"Oh no! He's going to crash!"

[Sakuraba]
"Now!"

[Taichi]
"He jumped the Ferrari!"

I flew lightly through the air.
And then...

[Tomoki]
"This took a turn for the worse..."

[Taichi]
"Even Rubber's still got ways to go..."

The Ferrari was embedded in the second story wall.

[Sakuraba]
"I'm not a huge fan of cars..."

[Tomoki]
"So now what do we do?"

[Taichi]
"There are still cars we can take to the city."

[Tomoki]
"We'll rack up a body count before we ever get to
the next town over."

[Sakuraba]
"If driving's a no-go, let's travel by train."

[Tomoki]
"We already told you the trains aren't running."

[Sakuraba]
"I still have these two feet."

Spread out before the three of us
was the railroad track.
It was a single track connecting to the 
neighboring town.
The track that spread to all corners of the world.

[Taichi]
"Good idea to walk along the rail."

[Tomoki]
"It should lead to a tunnel that passes through the
mountain..."

[Sakuraba]
"I've always wanted to try walking a 
railroad track."

[Taichi]
"Like a scene from a movie."

[Tomoki]
"Wasn't there a scene like that in one of the movies
we saw yesterday?"

[Taichi]
"There was."

[Sakuraba]
"Really? I don't remember it."

[Tomoki]
"You really don't check the content do you..."

Taichi crouched down and put his ear to the rail.

[Taichi]
"This was part of that scene as well, right?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, it was."

[Taichi]
"Crap, a train's coming!"

[Tomoki]
"So, they ran...and what happened? I remember 
a bridge..."

[Taichi]
"Then..."

[Tomoki]
"Then...?"

[Taichi]
"We lose Rubber."

[Tomoki]
"Hm...?"

I ran off.
Once the train came, I'd be a rabbit in headlights.
The rails bent and turned to contour the terrain.
But I had no fear of losing my way.
It was a single track.

[Tomoki]
"Walking on the rail is harder than I thought...
the rocks make it difficult."

[Taichi]
"Walk on the railroad ties, not the rocks."

[Sakuraba]
"I like to catwalk the rail."

[Taichi]
"That's easy. Hey, check out how well I can
balance."

Taichi balanced on one foot on one of the rails.

[Sakuraba]
"Hmph... I can do something better."

I grabbed the rail, went up into a handstand,
and walked down the rail on my hands.

[Tomoki]
"What's that all about?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Well?"

[Taichi]
"I can do that one-handed!"

[Sakuraba]
"I can do it with a single hand, fingers only!"

[Taichi]
"I could make it all the way to the next town 
like that!"

[Sakuraba]
"I could make it there and back!"

[Tomoki]
"Grow up guys..."

We continued walking playfully down the rail.
We walked for hours.
The sun mercilessly beat down on us.

[Tomoki]
"It's so hot... I can't handle this sunlight..."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm solar-powered!"

[Taichi]
"Reusable source of energy... How ecologically
friendly..."

[Tomoki]
"Only someone like Sakuraba can regenerate that way."

[Taichi]
"Seriously, why are you so cheery?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because we're on an adventure!"

[Tomoki]
"But even the rails on our feet are boiling..."

[Sakuraba]
"I can convert geothermal energy too!"

[Tomoki]
"Seems like you can convert energy from anything.
It's useless energy, but still..."

I broke out ahead of the group with a rapid gait.

[Taichi]
"Rubber... Can we take a quick break?
We've been walking forever."

[Sakuraba]
"But I feel fine."

Taichi lowered his voice and spoke once more.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki's looking a little ragged..."

We stopped under some shade alongside the rail
and took a rest.

[Tomoki]
"Sorry to slow us down, guys."

[Sakuraba]
"How are your legs? Do they hurt?"

[Tomoki]
"They're not too bad. It's just unfamiliar terrain."

[Taichi]
"No need to hurry, let's pace ourselves."

[Tomoki]
"I'll be fine after we rest."

[Taichi]
"But if you become unable to walk, we're screwed."

[Tomoki]
"That's true, there are no doctors or ambulances."

[Taichi]
"Rubber, let's slow down a bit from here on, okay?"

[Sakuraba]
"Gotcha. By the way...do we have any water?"

[Taichi]
"You didn't bring a canteen?"

[Sakuraba]
"I drank the last of what we got a while back."

[Taichi]
"You're running pretty well on empty..."

[Tomoki]
"I've got plenty extra water."

Tomoki took a water bottle out of his
mountain-climbing backpack.
Two liters of natural spring water.

[Sakuraba]
"It must be pretty heavy, carrying all that stuff."

[Tomoki]
"It's heavy, but it's necessary."

[Sakuraba]
"Wait a sec, I'll lighten your load."

I gulped down the water.
My head began to spin...

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Sakuraba]
"The water's getting me drunk."

[Taichi]
"That makes no sense."

[Tomoki]
"You're sweating a lot..."

[Sakuraba]
"All of a sudden, yeah."

[Taichi]
"You were dehydrated, so you probably couldn't sweat
until now."

[Tomoki]
"And you said you didn't sleep at all, either.
And all you eat is curry rolls."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm fine."

[Taichi]
"That's what happens when you're dying. Your senses
dull. You'll run out of volts if you don't rest."

[Sakuraba]
"Oh... I see."
"So I run on batteries?"

[Tomoki]
"It was a metaphor."

[Taichi]
"Let's rest until evening. It'll be better to walk
while it's cool."

[Sakuraba]
"Is that right?"

I fell asleep in an instant.
When I came to, it was evening.
We continued walking the twilit rail.

[Taichi]
"You all right, Rubber?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm running on hydro-power now."

[Taichi]
"Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"I'm fine. I can still walk, as long as we stay at
this pace."

[Taichi]
"All right, we're back on track."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmph... Perfect condition."

[Taichi]
"Ding dong ding dong, this is the Taichi
Broadcasting Office. We have an unfortunate
announcement to make."
"Now I'm not feeling so well."

[Tomoki]
"What the hell?!"

[Taichi]
"The sunset is too red... It's like the color of
blood and its making me sick."

[Sakuraba]
"Close your eyes, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Huh?!"

[Sakuraba]
"If you don't see it, you should be fine."

[Taichi]
"Ah, right... But how the hell do I walk?!"

[Sakuraba]
"We'll guide you."

[Tomoki]
"We're right beside you."

[Taichi]
"Alien Gray?!"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, just like your hair."

[Taichi]
"It's silver."

[Sakuraba]
"The Gold-Silver Duo became the Gold-Ash Duo..."

[Taichi]
"That's a played-out duo name."

[Sakuraba]
"Add Tomoki to the mix, and it's the Gold-Ash-Brown
Duo."

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't it be a trio? Whatever, It's not like I'm
ash anyway, I'm out."

[Tomoki]
"I'll pass, too."

[Sakuraba]
"The trio fell apart already?!"

[Taichi]
"Gold stands alone."

[Sakuraba]
"What's that supposed to mean?"

[Taichi]
"It's your stage name."

[Sakuraba]
"The Golden One? Not a bad name."

[Taichi]
"Stop trying so hard to spin it into a good title.
It's a bad habit of yours."

We continued talking nonsense as we walked.
The sun fell, and it began to get dark.
And we continued walking.

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, do we wanna make a bonfire?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, it's too hot."

[Tomoki]
"Me too."

[Sakuraba]
"But night trips needs bonfires!"

[Taichi]
"Sure, if it gets cold."

[Sakuraba]
"Campfires are a summer thing, right?"

[Taichi]
"You call this camping?"

[Tomoki]
"It's finally cooled down, so let's get a move on."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay..."

I decided to walk in earnest.

[Sakuraba]
"So, that's a definite no on the bonfire...?"

[Taichi]
"Definitely not."

[Tomoki]
"Let's walk."

[Sakuraba]
"Wild animals are scared of fire."

[Taichi]
"But there are no more animals."

[Tomoki]
"So there's no reason to start a bonfire."

[Sakuraba]
"Got it. I'll get ready."

I ran off to the nearest thicket.

[Taichi]
"Heeey, Rubber!"

[Tomoki]
"Sakuraba, where'd you go?"

I heard their voices.

[Sakuraba]
"Over here!"

I shouted.

[Tomoki]
"Don't just run off like that!"

The two of them found me.

[Sakuraba]
"We are ready for the bonfire."

I showed them all the branches I had gathered.

[Taichi]
"That wood's still green."

[Tomoki]
"If you don't dry it first, the smoke will be awful."

[Sakuraba]
"No need for such extravagance. I just wanna savor 
a bonfire."

[Tomoki]
"What should we do? Maybe just for a bit?"

[Taichi]
"Who could argue against such impulsive stupidity?"

[Tomoki]
"Taichi, friendship is..."

[Taichi]
"Not asking anything in return..."

[Tomoki]
"You sound unpleasant."

[Taichi]
"This time, I want something in return."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm going to light it."

[Taichi]
"Don't be shy, go ahead."

[Sakuraba]
"Can I borrow a light, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, do you have something?"

[Tomoki]
"Nah, nothing like that."

[Sakuraba]
"No lighter, no matches? We need a light."

[Taichi]
"We don't have one."

[Tomoki]
"That's too bad..."

[Sakuraba]
"Even a magnifying glass would be fine."

[Taichi]
"And what would you do with that...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Focus the sun's energy."

[Taichi]
"It's nighttime."

[Sakuraba]
"That's true. Let's wait for morning then."

[Taichi]
"Now look. It's completely dark now, because of
fooling around so much."

Taichi took a flashlight out of his bag.

[Taichi]
"We can keep walking with this, but it would be
better if we got there in the morning."

[Tomoki]
"We wouldn't be able to find anything since 
it's so dark."

[Taichi]
"All right. Let's get moving once the sun rises."

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"What's up?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, we should eat while we wait."

[Sakuraba]
"What's that, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"A sandwich, handmade by Youko."

[Sakuraba]
"I wanna sandwich."

[Taichi]
"I've only got enough for one. I had the other 
one for lunch."

[Sakuraba]
"What're you eating, Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"A chocolate bar, left over from Tazaki Mart."

[Sakuraba]
"Give me chocolate. Give me some."

[Tomoki]
"There is no more food for today. You used all of
yours for cooking experiments, remember?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm the kind of man who doesn't look to the past."

[Tomoki]
"Well that's admirable. But still, no food for you."

[Sakuraba]
"Awww..."

I was so hungry I felt like I would die.
I stood up and headed for the mountain.

[Taichi]
"Rubber, where're you going?"

[Sakuraba]
"Hunting. I'll go find some dinner."

[Tomoki]
"I told you that's not possible."

[Sakuraba]
"I'll set a trap, it should catch a deer or hog or
something."

[Taichi]
"The animals are all gone, remember?"

[Sakuraba]
"Really? First I've heard of it."

[Taichi]
"We said so before."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm a bit deaf so I can't help it."

[Tomoki]
"Only to things you don't wanna hear."
"There are no sounds of birds or bugs, you know."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm a city boy, I don't know anything about nature."

[Tomoki]
"Right, so why would you volunteer to go hunting?"

Tomoki chased after me.

[Tomoki]
"Dammit, I'm sorry for that."

[Sakuraba]
"For what?"

[Tomoki]
"I was a bit outta line, so I'm apologizing."

Tomoki rummaged through his belongings.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

He handed me a paper bag.

[Tomoki]
"It's rations. Curry rolls."

There actually were curry rolls inside.
And it was the cafeteria curry rolls.
My favorite.

[Sakuraba]
"I thought they were all gone."

[Tomoki]
"I found them when I went gathering food.
You handed them out all over town."

[Sakuraba]
"But these were my gifts to the starving people."

[Tomoki]
"That's you right now, buddy."

[Sakuraba]
"Thanks, past me."

[Taichi]
"Thank Tomoki, not your past self!"

It's just like Taichi said.
I said it to Tomoki.

[Sakuraba]
"Friendship is..."

[Tomoki]
"Not asking anything in return."

Friendship is wonderful.
The three of us laid on the ground with our 
stomachs full.
I looked up to the sky and gazed at the stars.

[Sakuraba]
"It's like a dream come true."

[Taichi]
"What is?"

[Sakuraba]
"Going on an adventure. It's a dream come true."

[Tomoki]
"We were camping last week, you know."

[Sakuraba]
"But camping is different from an adventure."

[Taichi]
"You're rich, you must've been on a ton of trips."

[Sakuraba]
"I've never been, not even once."

[Tomoki]
"Huh? No overseas trips or anything?"

[Sakuraba]
"I went to America."

[Tomoki]
"So you have traveled! I'm so jealous."

[Sakuraba]
"That wasn't a trip. It was a homestay."

[Taichi]
"Blonde and lived abroad? If you were a pretty girl
you'd practically be an unlockable character."

[Sakuraba]
"Feel free to unlock me."

[Taichi]
"That's a big fat no."

[Tomoki]
"How many years did you stay over there?"

[Sakuraba]
"It was supposed to be for a year."

[Taichi]
"What happened with that?"

[Sakuraba]
"My parents moved in next door."

[Tomoki]
"Huh? Why...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because they love me."

[Tomoki]
"That's different from any homestay
I've ever heard of."

[Sakuraba]
"Thanks to them, I didn't feel like anything
was missing from my life there."

[Taichi]
"You can't possibly call that a homestay anymore.
Your family just resided in America."

[Sakuraba]
"But on the flip side of that, I never got to go to
summer camp."

[Tomoki]
"I'm not sure how their moving kept you from camp."

[Sakuraba]
"My old man was worried, so they didn't let me go."

[Tomoki]
"Your point is, you just wanted to travel 
on your own?"

[Sakuraba]
"I've always thought about leaving town and
traveling around the world."

[Tomoki]
"Can't really tell if this is a big or small dream..."

[Taichi]
"Well, you're about to leave town tomorrow."

[Sakuraba]
"Ahhh. It really is like a dream come true."

The sun came up.
It was Sunday morning.

[Sakuraba]
"All right, let's go! Onward, men!"

I was so excited.

[Taichi]
"Seriously, why is he so cheery?"

[Tomoki]
"You seem pretty sleepy saying that, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"I'm more nocturnal. I prefer to go back to sleep in
the morning."

[Tomoki]
"That's because you were up late talking about
perverted things."

[Taichi]
"It's not like you got much sleep either."

[Tomoki]
"I used to play sports. I had to wake up early."

[Taichi]
"You're an immoral brat, but at least you're
healthy."

[Tomoki]
"Knock it off with that immoral crap..."

I looked back to see those two sluggishly marching.

[Sakuraba]
"Hurry up, or I'm leaving you behind!"

I ran off once more.
I should...go on an adventure.
If I found some food in the next town over,
I'd head out then and there.
To somewhere far away, and then somewhere further.
We made it to the tunnel that lead to town.

[Sakuraba]
"So if we pass through this, we'll be in the next
town over."

[Tomoki]
"We'll have to keep walking once we exit the tunnel,
till we reach the center of the city."

[Sakuraba]
"Going over this mountain is my trial."

[Tomoki]
"We won't be going over it, just passing through it."

[Taichi]
"Too bad, your trial ends in failure, Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"Failure? Well then, I guess I'll just have to 
start over."

[Taichi]
"Start over from where?"

[Sakuraba]
"From when I was gonna bike across the ridge."

[Tomoki]
"From that far back?"

[Sakuraba]
"I now realize that it was an important moment."

[Taichi]
"Hold on, Rubber. There's no 'starting over' 
in life."

[Sakuraba]
"Ugh..."

[Taichi]
"Think of how carefree we'd be if we could just
start over."
"Why doesn't life have save points? I wanna quick
load to that time with that one girl..."

[Tomoki]
"That would be great."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, Tomoki. There's no secret happy ending
for you and Yuuka other than a bad one."

[Tomoki]
"Gwah, don't tear my heart outta my ass for fun!"

[Taichi]
"Rubber wants to get outta town too, so why does it
matter how he does it?"

[Tomoki]
"We're almost at the goal."

[Sakuraba]
"That's right. Anyone would be a fool to turn around
when the finishing line is right in front of them."

[Taichi]
"A complete fool."

[Tomoki]
"An absolute idiot..."

[Taichi]
"So when are you starting over, Sakuraba?"

[Tomoki]
"You did say you were gonna start over."

[Sakuraba]
"I get the feeling you two are making fun of me."

[Taichi]
"Just your imagination."

[Tomoki]
"Enough goofing around, let's go."

We entered the tunnel.
It curved gently as it stretched on, and not long
after entering we could no longer see the entrance.

[Tomoki]
"It's so cool in here!"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm cut off from my solar energy!"

The light from the tunnel entrance got dimmer as we
proceeded, and we were gradually sinking into
darkness.

[Taichi]
"Better get the light before it's pitch-black."

The light from Taichi's flashlight
reflected dimly off the rails.
It took me a moment to realize we had gone
completely silent.
The only sound that filled the tunnel
was that of our footsteps echoing.
Time continued to pass.
The light of the exit was nowhere in sight.

[Sakuraba]
"We've been walking for so long. Are we there yet?"

[Tomoki]
"It's strange. I figured we'd be near the 
exit by now."

[Taichi]
"Weird. Who knew the tunnel would be this long?"

We continued walking.
I had no idea how long we had been walking.
Or how far.

[Sakuraba]
"It's so dark and it all looks the same,
it feels like we haven't gone anywhere."

[Tomoki]
"But...haven't we walked pretty far by now?"

[Taichi]
"I've been keeping count."
"We've been walking for over two hours,
and more than 10 kilometers."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmph... That's a lot of walking. And still no exit?"

[Taichi]
"It's not right, this tunnel can't be that long."

[Sakuraba]
"Did we get lost?"

[Taichi]
"It's impossible to get lost on a one-way track,
even for you."

[Sakuraba]
"And I haven't even gotten hungry."

[Tomoki]
"Now that you mention it...
I'm not thirsty, either."

[Taichi]
"Is our sense of time getting messed up?"

[Tomoki]
"Why don't we go back? I've got a bad feeling 
about this."

[Sakuraba]
"You wanna run away?"

[Tomoki]
"Weren't you the one who wanted to 'start over'?"

[Taichi]
"Wait! I see light!"

Far ahead in the distance, there was a faint 
shimmer of light.
The further forward we went, the brighter it got.

[Taichi]
"It's the exit! Woohoo!"

Taichi broke into a full sprint ahead of us.

[Sakuraba]
"It's a race!"

I ran after him.

[Tomoki]
"Oh come on, gimme a handicap!"

Tomoki followed behind.
But no matter how much we ran, we weren't getting
any closer to the exit.

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi, what's going on?!"

[Taichi]
"You think I know?!"

We stopped running and continued walking towards
that distant light.

[Sakuraba]
"What time is it now?"

[Tomoki]
"I've got no clue."

Beyond that point of light lay the world I'd dreamed
of, and yet...
Why couldn't I get there...?
Why couldn't I get out of this tunnel?
It was like my feet were stuck, and I was struggling
to get free.
Let me go. I wanna go!
We want out.
Out of this darkness.
All of my senses had gotten strange.
I couldn't tell if I was walking, running,
or standing still.
My insides felt like they had melted
and become one with the darkness.
I could no longer see Taichi or Tomoki.
All I saw was the light of the exit.
It was no bigger than when we first found it.
We were nowhere near it.
The light was some far-off thing that we could 
never reach.

[Taichi]
"I see it! The exit!"

Taichi's voice.
The exit was getting closer.
The scenery of the neighboring town stretched out
beyond there.
I could finally leave this town.
This was the beginning of my journey.
And in an instant, the exit was soaked red
in the evening sun's light.
The town before me vanished.
I want to start my journey.
Not yet? I'll start my journey next week.
