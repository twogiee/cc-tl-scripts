[Taichi]
"Well then, I'll go too."

[Miki]
"Okay, thank you..."

I guess she was anxious going alone.
We held hands again.

[Miki]
"Why did all this happen..."

[Taichi]
"No idea..."

[Miki]
"If there are no dead bodies, did they just
disappear?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe they all went somewhere."

[Miki]
"Somewhere..."

[Taichi]
"Well, we have the power plant. Maybe they went
somewhere for evacuation."

[Miki]
"Does that mean it's dangerous here?"

[Taichi]
"I have no clue."

[Miki]
"But that doesn't explain why wireless and
telephones don't work."

[Taichi]
"You're right."

We arrived at Kiri's house.
Miki and I split and searched the house.

[Taichi]
"How was it?"

[Miki]
"No one?"

[Taichi]
"Not on this side."

Miki's shoulders slumped.

[Taichi]
"Maybe we didn't notice her or missed her. Should we
go back to school?"

[Miki]
"But we should have seen her in that road!"
"There's no way that we missed her..."

[Taichi]
"Maybe she got to school before us?"

[Miki]
"..."
"Sorry, I'll go look for her."

She ran off.

[Taichi]
"Hey, wait!"
"Ah, she took off..."

After that, Miki searched for Kiri for three days.
And after spending each day, Miki started to refuse
going out.
By the third day, she totally shut herself in the
house.
No matter how I tried to explain, there wasn't any
hint of her coming out.
Her heart must be completely out of hope.
Failure...
