[Taichi]
"We'll be together en route."

[Miki]
"Yes."

We walked.
On the way, Miki took my hand.

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

[Miki]
"I'll borrow it!"

[Taichi]
"Okay."

It was marvelous.
Miki had a slender, tiny hand.
And with that hand, among the eight mediators of the
world, had survived.
The timing of her kick when I was running.
Her moves when she helped Kiri on the rooftop.
Those were extraordinary.
The way she repelled the stiffness of the moment
when she was about to fire.
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary.
She had done all the enduring in order to survive.
I couldn't come up with other words to express my
admiration towards her.

[Taichi]
"Well, I guess this is it."

[Miki]
"..."

She didn't let go.

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"Um, well, I..."

[Taichi]
"Do you want to talk some more?"

[Miki]
"Well, honestly..."

[Taichi]
"Honestly?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, um... I wanted..."

She stopped.
I tried to help.

[Taichi]
"That reminds me."

[Miki]
"Yes?"

Her face shone.
Even if she was strong, she was innocent.

[Taichi]
"You helped Kiri on the rooftop, right?"

[Miki]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"I have a good eye so I knew..."

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Those weren't movements that were planned out."

Her eyes opened wide.

[Taichi]
"That's all I will say."

[Miki]
"..."

She stood still as if she heard a message from the
heaven.

[Taichi]
"Just live as you are now, Miki. You've done so far
to keep your current self."
"It'll be fun for my future self to have the great,
grown-up Miki teasing him."

[Miki]
"Y-yeah... I'll be a great grown-up..."

Her voice cracked.

[Taichi]
"Good, just do that."
"And here, the journal.
Make sure to put it by the shrine."

Her hands seemed so frail when she took it.

[Miki]
"Okay..."

I bent down for a final kiss.
We quickly parted.

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Well then, see you next week."

I liked that parting.
It was a cool way to say goodbye.
I turned around courteously.
And walked away like a gentleman.

[Miki]
"Taichi!"

I stopped.

[Miki]
"This week! Thank you for! Everything!"

She shouted it out like a cheerleader.

[Taichi]
"Okay..."

[Miki]
"See you next week!"

She waved at me.
Yes, just like that.
Live like you live for yourself.
Even if it's hard at times when you only had
yourself.
An extreme logic.
Because you can say self-sacrifice was all for
yourself as well.
Miki was really correct.

[Taichi]
"Okay!"

And so, we separated.
