There was no one in the classroom as I entered.
Even Touko wasn't at her usual seat.

[Taichi]
"Okay, then."

I took the script out from my bag.
I had finished it in one night.
Time to turn it in and get a quick okay.
To the roof.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She greeted me with suspicion.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Club President."
"Why do you have your arms around your chest?"

[Misato]
"Because..."

Her face turned red.

[Misato]
"Well, I can't remember what happened yesterday."

[Taichi]
"I guess you wouldn't."

[Misato]
"D-don't tell me... Don't tell me I..."

[Taichi]
"Wh-what's wrong?"

I played dumb.

[Misato]
"Hm..."

She looked down in confusion.
She didn't move her arms from her chest.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, come over here."

I grabbed her wrist and pulled.

[Misato]
"What the?!"

Misato shouted in response.

[Misato]
"Nooo!!"

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

[Misato]
"Pe..."

[Taichi]
"Pe...?"

[Misato]
"Per..."
"Percussionist!"

[Taichi]
"Percussionist?!"

In my mind, I saw Misato banging on a drum.

[Misato]
"I don't want to be a percussionist, is what I was
going to say."

[Taichi]
"I don't either, I guess."

[Misato]
"We have to be super careful."

[Taichi]
"O...kay?"
"I just didn't want you to get heat stroke, so I
moved you to the shade."

[Misato]
"Oh, is that so...? Well, then, let's go with that,
then."

I guess she was pretty sensitive about it.
Anyway, moving on...

[Taichi]
"Honestly, you had too much to drink yesterday."

[Misato]
"Oh, yeah, yeah..."
"Sorry..."

She seemed to shrink.

[Taichi]
"You caused quite a scene."

[Misato]
"Are you saying...I got so drunk I...did something
terrible?"

[Taichi]
"Well, not 'terrible.'"
"But it was a bit...indecent..."

I was at a loss for words.
I decided not to mention the incident with her bra.

[Misato]
"Wha?!"

Her eyes seemed to form a horizontal X.
I was completely speechless.

[Misato]
"Ahhh!"

[Taichi]
"But, relax. I took care of it, so no one would see
you."

[Misato]
"You did...? Well...then thank you."

She bowed, confused about what she was being
grateful for.

[Misato]
"I just wonder what disgrace I caused..."

[Taichi]
"Do you really want to know?"

[Misato]
"..."

I was lost.
I couldn't tell her, she was so worried.

[Taichi]
"Maybe you should take responsibility?"

[Misato]
"What?"

Her eyes grew wide.

[Taichi]
"I was thinking you should take responsibility..."

[Misato]
"Ugh..."
"What kind of thing did I do that I need to take
responsibility for?!"

[Taichi]
"How do I break this gently..."

[Misato]
"I-It was that bad?"

[Taichi]
"Do you really want to know?"

She just stood there thinking about it with a squint
on her face.
I didn't think that she could handle the fact
that her bra had come loose and I that I stole a
kiss from her.
Yeah... I should keep it to myself.

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"What really happened was..."

I told her a half-assed lie.

[Taichi]
"You took that antenna wire and used it for a naked
limbo dance session here."

[Misato]
"My life is over..."

She sat up, then slumped into a ball.

[Misato]
"Dear sir, in this spring of sleep, how are you
getting along?"

She recited something that sounded like it was out
of a fictitious quote.

[Taichi]
"Hey, are you gonna be okay?"

[Misato]
"I didn't think my life could get any worse!"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry, I destroyed the evidence."

[Misato]
"Oh... So that's why my bra..."

[Taichi]
"Are you saying that you didn't go home last night?"

She nodded without speaking.

[Taichi]
"So, are you... Wait, that's how you woke
up, right?"

She nodded again.

[Taichi]
"Then..."

*gulp* I swallowed hard.
That means right now...Misato is...
Below Misato's thin, transparent shirt...
I could see that she was n-naked!
Below her...shirt...naked!!
Well, all the girls in the world were naked under
their clothes.
But, this one had no bra on.
Now I understood why she was acting strange.
Her boobs were so big.
I could easily see the shape of them through her
shirt.
My heart began to race.

[Taichi]
"M-maybe you should go home, have a bath, and come
back?"

[Misato]
"Do I smell bad?"
"I was trying to wipe my body clean just using the
water here."

Ahh, I wished I had been there to see that.
Maybe if I had gotten up earlier...
How come these kinds of things don't happen to me?
I didn't have that kind of luck. I was incapable
of such eroism.
Taichi Keyword:
"Eroism"
The heroic nature of being a pervert.

[Taichi]
"Just leave it to me."

[Misato]
"Hm?"

I returned to the classroom.
I got my hand towel out from my bag.

[Taichi]
"Maybe this will do, instead??"

I gave it to her.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She was moved to tears.

[Taichi]
"Have you ever worn a halter top? If you use this
towel like that, it should cover you up."

[Misato]
"You're such a good boy."

Tears rolled down her face as she took my towel.

[Misato]
"Wait for me okay? Don't move an inch!"

[Taichi]
"All right."

She disappeared into the shadows.
I almost felt like going after her, but restrained
myself.

[Taichi]
"..."

I started to wonder what she would be like.

[Taichi]
"..."

Somehow, I couldn't imagine her.
Normally, I would have imagined her body completely.

[Taichi]
"Am I healthy now? Has the poison in my mind run its
course?"

But something still remained deep inside my heart.
I was becoming all-ages friendly.
It was the only way I could describe what was
happening to me.
Several minutes later...

[Misato]
"Hey Pekke, good morning!!"

Her face was bright when she returned.
And her boobs were still jutting out at me...

[Misato]
"It's such a beautiful summer day. It looks we're
going to have clear weather to come."

[Taichi]
"I guess so..."

[Misato]
"So what do you want to do this morning?"

[Taichi]
"I came to turn in the script you asked me for
yesterday."

[Misato]
"Script? You wrote the script for our first
transmission?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"Pekke, you're something. I underestimated you."

Her expression was filled with warmth and
admiration.

[Taichi]
"Well..."

I wriggled like a delighted little girl.

[Misato]
"Is it all right if I take a look?"

[Taichi]
"It's right here."

[Misato]
"Well, then."

I handed the paper over.
Her eyes grew serious.
She skimmed over the paper.

[Taichi]
"..."

It only took her a moment.
She lifted her head.
A smile filled her entire face. She looked
like...the Virgin Mother.
The Virgin Mother descended from Heaven.
And haloed in her holy light, she told me this...

[Misato]
"It sucks."

[Taichi]
"Yesssssorry come again?!"

My howl was loud enough to echo over the city.

[Taichi]
"I'll fix it."

[Misato]
"I'll be waiting."

I made to leave, shoulders slumped.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

But as I turned to leave, I saw the materials that
were leaning up against the wall begin to shift.

[Taichi]
"Misato...?"

[Misato]
"What?"

She just cocked her head to the side, oblivious to
the danger.
I started to move towards her.

[Taichi]
"Look out!"

[Misato]
"Wha?"

I wasn't going to make it in time.
Step-ladders, nails, tools, everything...
They all fell towards her.
It all came crashing down.

[Misato]
"Hn..."

She woke up.

[Taichi]
"You're okay... I was worried."

[Misato]
"Wasn't I just..."

[Taichi]
"I'm just glad you're okay..."

[Both]
Taichi: "...My sister."
Misato: "It's not like that..."

[Taichi]
"How heartbreaking."

I said as I returned to normal.

[Misato]
"Tell me what happened."

[Taichi]
"You were injured."
"I brought you here to get your wounds treated."
"And you just woke up."

[Misato]
"I was injured?"

[Taichi]
"A little."

[Misato]
"Hmm...?"

There were wounds all over her body.
Her arms were wrapped in bandages.
She had bandages here and there.

[Misato]
"Ow, it hurts all over..."

[Taichi]
"You were hit pretty hard..."

[Misato]
"I was careless..."

[Taichi]
"I'm glad nothing serious happened."

[Misato]
"Thanks Pekke, for taking care of me..."

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

[Misato]
"Okay, let's head back to club..."

[Taichi]
"Hey, don't move."

I stopped her.

[Misato]
"Why?"

[Taichi]
"You're more or less all right, but..."

I slowly lifted the sheet and her skirt with it.

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Look, these thick thighs of yours were hurt as
well. Why don't you take a break from the club, just
for today."

[Misato]
"Uh...uh..."

Her mouth opened and closed.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, you're bleeding."

Blood.

[Taichi]
"Do you want me to put on a new bandage on it?"

She nodded.
I got a fresh bandage and started to dress her
wound.

[Taichi]
"Now THAT..."
"Is a sexy leg..."

[Misato]
"I'll do it myself."

[Taichi]
"No, please, leave it to me."

[Misato]
"Please, let me..."

[Taichi]
"But..."

I looked at her thigh.
The blood was flowing.
It looked bad.

[Taichi]
"But..."

It was beautiful blood.
Flowing out of her.
Red blood.
Red. Red.
I felt dizzy and closed my eyes.
And opened them...
Ah...
The world was so bleary.
Everything in motion became red.
Easy, all so easy.
My senses strengthened, and the invisible
became visible.
The range of visible light widened.
My vision became hazy, and I became sensitive to
movement.
I suddenly forgot who I was.
I felt my consciousness changing.
Moving.
My body sensations became ambiguous.
I lost all sense of where I was and where I was not.
There was a red dot in the middle of my vision.
It was getting closer.
Noise.
Some kind of image was there.
I couldn't make out the details.
I lost all physical sensation.
I felt omnipotent, united with the whole world.
Noise.
What is this? What's happening?
The world was a strange place.
A red dot.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
I'd been mistaken.
I'd fooled myself into thinking the things I was
seeing were ordinary, everyday phenomena.
But that wasn't the truth.
That contradiction constricted and widened my view.
The beast within me awoke joyously; instinctually
aware its time had come.
A beast whose instincts were built on different
laws, impulses, and arrangements than those of this
world.

[Taichi]
"wwwvvww~~"

I made a sound.
Noise.
What...was that?
I focused my consciousness.
I had to hear it.
To decipher it.
To connect it.
To define it.
That's right.
I'm hearing a sound.
The waves coming from my mouth were
sound waves, too.
My senses converged. If I could figure out what the
sound was, I could translate it.
####
Mi#####
Misato#k##ke?#

[Misato]
"Pe#...k##ke?"
"Pek#ke?"
"Pekke...?"

Ah, I see.
Misato Miyasumi.
It was her.
Those were her words.
Misato's red.
"You're always alone, right?"
That's why.
"Would you like to join my club?"
I will fend off any attacks.

[Taichi]
"Get out of here!"

[Misato]
"Wha?"

My vision became clear.

[Taichi]
"Hn..."

My head hurt.

[Taichi]
"Holy hell, my head..."

The timing couldn't have been worse.
The blood and the setting sun were bad enough alone,
but together...
I was about to cry.

[Taichi]
"Man, I really screwed up..."

[Misato]
*sob sob sob*

My venus, Misato, was crying.

[Taichi]
"Who did this?! Whoever made Misato cry,
show yourself!"

I stood in a fighting stance with my palms open
forward.

[Taichi]
"I will defeat you, using my 'Karade'!"

[Misato]
*sob sob sob sob*

[Taichi]
"Misato, who did this to you?"

She pointed at me.

[Taichi]
"It's as hard to exercise self-discipline as it is
for me to spell it!"

[Misato]
"Pekke? Is that you, Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Uh...yes?"

[Misato]
"Ah the normal Pekke is back...!"

[Taichi]
"Your eternal beloved prince, Taichi."

I kneeled.

[Taichi]
"Do you require my 'Karade' skills?"

[Misato]
"I'm not sure exactly what you mean by 'Karade,' but
I don't need any martial arts help..."
"Pekke, you were like a Robodian just now, I was so
scared."

Misato Keyword:
"Robodian"
Another word for robot.

[Taichi]
"A Taichi-robot?"

[Misato]
"Something like that."

[Taichi]
"I was just confused."

[Misato]
"Are you all right now...?"

She didn't pursue the topic too much.

[Taichi]
"Yes, my dual-boot OS supports Rapid Switching
Technology..."

[Misato]
"Mr. Hashizaki has always said that your English
scores are horrible."

[Taichi]
"Well, let's just clean up that blood for now."
