She was always alone.
She never associated with relatives nor house
servants.
The Isolated Princess...
That's what I called her to myself.
We never exchanged words.
I was interested in her though.
I didn't know what kind of people maintained this
mansion nor what kind of path it took to end up like
it was.
But that place was a paradise isolated from time
itself.
The people who stayed there were the types that
fled from life.
Sometimes I would be invited by the ladies for some
sweet drinks.
I dressed up, enjoyed some tea, invited people, took
walks.
At the beginning of every month, mass amounts of
books, clothes and luxury goods were received.
The yard was spacious too.
There were gardeners who maintained it.
Even if you considered the place was isolated and
being cheap, the place was boundless.
The mansion felt like an unbounded world for a child
like me.
I actually didn't have any memories prior to living
in that mansion.
The size of the mansion and world I lived in was the
same.
From a certain time, the ladies started to have
interest in me.
They told me I had the face of a girl.
Also, my white hair and my eyes, which had a
mystical pattern when seen closely, kept them busy.
They dressed me in girls' (especially gorgeous)
dresses.
And I had tea with them.
Children didn't know the true taste of teas.
But I accompanied them anyways.
Defying them wasn't an option for me, especially
towards the people who showed sweetness.
Also, I didn't mind it...
My duty of having kids ride me like a horse and
pulling my hair as if I were toy, was now being a
cute doll for the ladies.
But she... The Isolated Princess, looked at me with
a cold stare.
No, she wasn't even looking.
She didn't have any interest, and her gazes were
always passing right through me.
Youko Hasekura.
The youngest daughter.
But, it seemed like the family didn't show love to
her so much.
Rather, she was neglected.
I could understand that she lived in a different
world than the ladies living their fantasies.
...In the world called reality.
Once, I was recruited for cleaning duty.
That was before I became a doll.
I participated with the house servants.
They didn't hire anybody from the outside so
manpower always came from servants from within the
mansion.
We cleaned the rooms one by one, with an hour 
break at 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock.
I arrived at her room in the afternoon.
That was the first time I heard her voice.
"This room is fine..."
Short and cold.
Efficient.
But alluring.
In a short glance, I could never imagine the room
belonged to a girl.
There were multiple computers.
Walls covered with bookshelves, and floors stacked
with books that didn't fit on the shelves.
Heavy-duty work table with tools that were worn out.
The room was filled with knowledge and technology
like it was a secret base.
It was like she was an outsider, living in an outside
world.
With a pretty little dress and a feminine voice, I
asked about Youko Hasekura to the ladies during tea
time.
A quiet elder lady answered.
Youko was the daughter of the youngest son.
A cheerful young lady chimed in.
Youko was not a daughter they wished for.
Then the three sisters chirped off one after
another.
They spoke of a love story between a master and his
servant, and the consequences of that love.
They spoke of the daughter who was not loved, a
tragedy waiting to happen.
The disgrace of being the bloodline of the Hasekura
but not a part of the family.
In short, an unwanted child. An accident.
No one spoke to her and she spoke to no one.
A tumor.
Her real father, the young master, took off
overseas to study abroad.
Her mother, the young servant...had passed away.
A young girl who couldn't become anybody.
A young girl who wasn't needed by anyone.
She was hurt.
No. She wasn't.
Youko Hasekura was strong.
She didn't care at all.
She probably knew.
That the world was a boxed garden.
I went to the library during my doll life.
I might have been influenced.
I learned manners and how to serve tea from the
ladies.
But, there was no knowledge, skill, or truth of the
real world there.
I frequently visited the library, which hardly
anyone used, to fill that gap.
I met Youko there often.
Still, no conversation.
I found it kind of annoying, so I didn't approach
her either.
I had interest in her but had no desire to become
friends.
My aesthetic trend seemed to be established
at that point.
How should I say it... I was attracted to things
that were independent.
Ones who lived independently and had the power to do
so.
Knowledge. Technology. Independence.
People swarmed.
They had the need to swarm.
But at the same time, they tried to hold their
personal space.
They wanted a place of their own where no one could
trespass.
But your boundaries swayed when they came in contact
with others.
Territory grew and shrank.
Discomfort.
Contradiction.
Typically, one manned hero was more valued than a
magnificent army of a thousand.
The Absolute One. A hero.
What people had desired.
It was just a desire in the form of aspiration.
Did people want to live on their own, or in a crowd?
Anyway, back on track.
I read the books she read in the library.
Out of aspiration.
Or maybe I was jealous of her perfection.
The books were so high level, I barely understood
them.
But I kept reading.
We met and passed by one another hundreds of times
in the library.
We shared the same room, but we never had
a conversation.
That era continued, for several years.
And so.
Paradises never lasted forever.
An inevitable outcome, considering that even
humanity's first paradise ended in the same way.
Destruction.
The head of the Hasekura family had a sudden
decline.
That was the start of the disaster.
The elegant people of Hasekura had left.
The servants were left behind.
An emerging individual and his relatives arrived
to replace the Hasekura family.
They were rude people.
Men and women of all ages arrived.
They all had characteristics of scavengers.
Not even three days had passed, and one of the
servants was assaulted.
An incident.
But we were in a box garden.
Closed space.
They created their own regulations.
The mansion being surrounded by massive amount of
land made it near extraterritorial.
It was surprising on what kind banquets were held
daily.
One of the rooms was originally used as a party
hall.
The Hasekura family loved having parties and often
used that room.
The rude people used it for a different "party".
There were no well-mannered conversations nor
quality meals.
It was filled with corruption and degeneration
instead.
...Several people must have become victims.
A few even went to the police.
But they never intervened.
Your only savior was your own capability.
...You had to think that way to not be angry.
Unless it caused you any harm, being upset from the
clumsiness of others or their lack of knowledge...
Meant that you have a piece of mind entrusted in
others.
But that was normal.
And being normal meant...
That you are in an area that had unfair and
incomplete rules due to the limit people had.
This wasn't an easy environment to live in...
Morals are a blur in such closed space.
Violence became more of a daily event.
One needed a firm ego to go against them.
A strong belief for yourself was needed.
Like hers...
Now then.
In this world inside the boxed garden, in this new
law, violence was tolerated.
A husband who escaped with his wife, was brought
back and murdered.
The body was buried in the yard.
The men guffawed and buried the body at the root of
the cherry blossom tree.
They were men with broken morals.
One day, a man came with his family.
A new character arrived.
He was sadistic and perverted.
To carry on the story easier, we will call him S.
S had his eyes on me.
I was forced to dress as a baby girl and take part
in their so called "parties".
But instead of a tea party, I was used to keep S
entertained.
Well, I've experienced a lot of things.
Soon after, S became more sadistic.
He brought a child.
His child.
He was the school bully at his school... Or so they
said.
It was only a moment, that he was overwhelmed with
the atmosphere. As soon as he looked at me he
sneered.
Arousal from the abnormal atmosphere.
He actively participated out of urge.
Like father like son. His talents showed.
It might also be because of his being precocious.
He became really into it.
I was everyone's laughing stock.
And for several weeks, while being laughed at...
I was attacked continuously.
*buzz*
Then there was a noise.
