[Taichi]
"Hey, gloomy lady."

[Touko]
"..."

She didn't look too good.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"What's up with you!"

She was immediately offended by me.
I seriously worried about her.

[Taichi]
"Your complexion doesn't look too good."
"Even if you don't have an appetite, you should at
least give your body some energy."
"The body gives up before the mind does."

[Touko]
"Mind your own business!"

[Taichi]
"You're good at cooking right?"

She had said so before.

[Touko]
"Just leave me alone."

She didn't even look back at me.

[Taichi]
"Oh well."
"Here, give me your hand."

[Touko]
"Hand?"

[Taichi]
"Give me your hand."

Like a detective, Touko's face filled with
suspicion.
Although real detectives wouldn't reveal their
suspicions with their expressions so easily.

[Touko]
"You're trying to slip something strange
into my hands again aren't you?"

[Taichi]
"Hah, you make it sound like I've really done
something like that before."

I spat at something imaginary (my sociality).

[Touko]
"You haven't?!"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

I spaced out.

[Touko]
"You didn't? Are you kidding? You made me hold onto
something tightly!"

[Taichi]
"Did something like that happen?"

I spoke in the tone of a dumb kid.

[Touko]
"Don't play innocent!"

[Taichi]
"I guess I don't really remember?"

[Touko]
"Liar! Your face says it all!"

[Taichi]
"My face?"

[Touko]
"I still have the feeling left in my hands!"

She trembled.

[Taichi]
"The taste of a nobleman."

[Touko]
"The taste of a sexual offender!!
A nobleman wouldn't do such a thing!!"

[Taichi]
"It's not like you're not interested in me, though."

[Touko]
"Whaaa."

Her deathly white face turned even more pale.

[Taichi]
"You were really happy."

[Touko]
"Happy?!"

*machine gun fire*

[Taichi]
"YOU WIN!"

I danced through the air.
My flight followed the curvature of a parabola,
before I collapsed.

[Taichi]
"This is my spirit's duty... Eee... Ouch..."

I got up and slowly re-arranged the scattered desk
and chairs.

[Touko]
"..."

Touko went back to being like how she was before.
Her face was like a shape memory alloy.
The blood of a nobleman, huh?

[Taichi]
"Um, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"..."

*sigh*

[Taichi]
"Okay, it's fine even if you're ignoring me."
"Here, hand."

I took her hand by force.

[Touko]
"Hey..."

*drop drop drop*

[Taichi]
"Try the taste of mom's cooking."

Three candy balls rolled around her palm.

[Touko]
"Ah!"

[Taichi]
"Relaaax. Wonderful two hundred-million-dollar life,
just relaaax."

[Touko]
"You make no sense, really."

[Taichi]
"The other day, I saw a girl whose skirt
was caught in her butt."

[Touko]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"So then, I pulled her skirt out so she could relax...
But she glared right back at me."

[Touko]
"Of course she would..."

[Taichi]
"Yup. So I shoved her skirt back in! (lol)"

[Touko]
"You pervert!"

[Taichi]
"Wha?!"

[Touko]
"In other words, you groped her!!"

[Taichi]
"Uh..."

[Touko]
"So how does that have anything to do with being
wonderful?"

[Taichi]
"I didn't have any bad intentions, so calm down."

[Touko]
"How can I?!"

[Taichi]
"Nothing posionous or malicous. What I'm trying to
say is, I'm perfectly safe."

[Touko]
"I don't trust you."

[Taichi]
"Honestly, those are really just plain candy balls."

[Touko]
"Why wouldn't they be."

Touko held the candy balls.
Tightly.

[Taichi]
"Your body should be content with the sugar content
for the time being."

I also thought that those puns were forgivable.

[Taichi]
"Even if you have no appetite, just keep practicing
putting stuff in your mouth."

Touko stared at her fist.

[Touko]
"You're always like that."
"You act friendly, stupid, cold and scary, all at
once."
"I don't get it."

She hid her face.

[Touko]
"Just leave me alone. Please."

[Taichi]
"All right..."

She really was pretty angry.
