[Taichi]
"But first..."

I stared at the script.
I wasn't sure how to continue with it. I was totally
stuck.
My hand wouldn't move.
The pen wouldn't write.
Writer's block.

[Taichi]
"Hmmmmmm..."

Of course.
I decided to change into something a little more
comfortable.

[Taichi]
"For literary inspiration..."

Because how you felt was important.
And so, in my new mindset...

[Tomoki]
"Heeey!"

A voice rang out from the entryway.

[Taichi]
"What's with the yelling?"

[Tomoki]
"Whoa... Taichi?"

Tomoki was put off at suddenly seeing me in my
kimono.

[Tomoki]
"That face..."

[Taichi]
"Knock it off."

[Tomoki]
"No, not the face. That outfit..."

[Taichi]
"Is it really so weird?"

[Tomoki]
"It's a Japanese kimono."

[Taichi]
"It's my Japanese Soseki."

[Tomoki]
"Soseki, huh?... Wow."
"Do you always dress like that?"

[Taichi]
"..."
"Of course."

[Tomoki]
"That's cool, I guess."

Tomoki was being much more respectful
than I expected.
It was only my second time wearing the kimono,
but still...

[Taichi]
"So, why are you here so late?"

[Tomoki]
"No real reason, just trying to get this junk off my
hands."

He was holding a cardboard box.
I took it from him.

[Taichi]
"It's pretty heavy."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, it's packed full."

[Taichi]
"It's too dark, I can't tell what's inside."

[Tomoki]
"Just some leftovers from club. It's summertime, so
it'll go bad if we keep it too long."

[Taichi]
"There's snacks in here?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"Sorry for the trouble."

[Tomoki]
"It's all good. Like they say..."
"Friendship is..."

[Taichi]
"Not asking anything in return."

*thumbs-up*
We shared a big laugh, then gave each other a
thumbs-up.

[Taichi]
"You may be an innocent lad, but I'll be looking out
for you."

[Tomoki]
"Thanks."
"Oh, that reminds me..."

His face tightened.

[Tomoki]
"Kirihara is out."

[Taichi]
"Say what...?!"

[Tomoki]
"To put it more accurately, she's been knocked out."

[Taichi]
"The Harakiri Fist Master doesn't go down easy,
not even to my Karade."

[Tomoki]
"No Dummy! She just fainted...and I have no idea
what Karade is..."
"Anyhow, Sakuraba's taking care of her right now,
but of course he's not very helpful... Maybe
Hasekura can look after her."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that makes sense."

[Tomoki]
"Can you get her now?"

[Taichi]
"Sure, I'll be right back."

I put on sandals and went to Hasekura's house.
When I returned, Tomoki was still there.

[Taichi]
"Okay, Hasekura is heading their way now."

[Tomoki]
"That was fast..."
"She listens to you pretty well, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Well if she doesn't, all sorts of problems start
popping up for her."

[Tomoki]
"Sorry?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind that, wanna come up and play
some PC-98?"

Not that I had anything like that...

[Taichi]
"I'll even let you change the disks!"

[Tomoki]
"What's a PC-98?"

[Taichi]
"Tell me that's a joke, mi amigo."

[Tomoki]
"No comprende..."

Tomoki's gags always played out like this.

[Taichi]
"You really don't know what a PC-98 is?"

I played the part of a hardcore computer nerd.

[Tomoki]
"I'm not sure I've even heard of it..."

[Taichi]
"So that's the kind of person I'm talking to?
Man, kids these days..."
"The PC old guard swear by this illustrious machine,
and you're just spitting in their face!"

[Tomoki]
"Nah... I mean, you know those kinda guys..."

[Taichi]
"?!"

I broke into a cold sweat.

[Taichi]
"Don't say those kinds of things!!"

[Tomoki]
"Why not?"

Tomoki had little understanding of the frightening
things in this world.

[Taichi]
"A-are you too young to understand? Are you?
Oh, the horror that is the recklessness of your
youth, Tomoki!"

[Tomoki]
"Come on, it's not like those old guys know
everything about PCs anyway."

[Taichi]
"Gwaaaaaah?!"

I could feel my lifespan shortening with Tomoki's
every word.
And then I remembered something.
It had been aroud this time last year.
The time when Yusa had came to hang out with me. The
first time I had worn traditional Japanese clothes.
