I was having a nightmare.
Yeah...a terrible dream.
I kept having this nightmare.
A never-ending, eternal nightmare.
That's why I had to wake up.

[Touko]
"..."
"It wasn't a dream."

My stomach growled.
Even in this world, you got hungry.
I opened the door and called out.

[Touko]
"Anyone? Anyone out there? Still no breakfast?"

No answer.
A hateful silence returned to the large house.
I looked around the mansion, but no one was there.
Everyone was gone.
Maids, cooks, drivers, even family...
It wasn't a dream. No one here. No one inside.

[Touko]
"..."
"I'm...going out!"

No reply...

[Touko]
"Jeez...I know already..."

I headed off to school.
A road filled with hills... What was its name?
I couldn't recall.
A long time ago, Taichi said something about them, 
I think.

[Touko]
"All those...whatever..."

There really was one else on the road to school...
Even though today was the beginning of the semester.

[Touko]
"Even so...the weather's so nice
it makes me mad."

I just kept walking.

[Touko]
"Why do I have to walk myself to school...?"

Going to school was fine. But on the way home,
I had to climb up this hill.
On top of that, yesterday I tripped and dropped 
my bottle...
It doesn't make sense to have a house
on top of a hill like that!

[Touko]
"I...want to go home."

A town with no one.
I walked along an empty street, through a shopping
street with no one, and past stores manned by
no one.
This place had always been pretty quiet anyway.
Quiet like a town at midnight. No sounds of a
typical morning. No voices, cars, birds, nothing.
Like a TV with the sound muted...sort of scary.

[Touko]
"So what? Who cares? It doesn't matter to me."

I spoke aloud purposefully.
But after I said it, I looked around fretfully.
If someone saw me just now...
But no one was there.
Good.
So I arrived at an empty school.
Today was the first day of the semester.
But with everyone gone like this, it made me look
like I mistakenly went to school on Sunday!
I guess everyone else really was gone.
Yeah, it was the same as usual...nothing changed.
It would be the same even if they were here.
Students, townspeople, helpers, family... Even if
they were here, it would feel like they're not.
Things just became a little more inconvenient...
Yeah, that's all.
I arrived at a classroom with no one there.
A distant, formal classroom with no other students.
Why am I here though?
I didn't meet anyone on the way here.
The meddlesome helpers, gone. Annoying parents,
gone. Pitiful people around town, gone... Everyone
gone!
Swaths of annoying people, all disappeared.
Erased like the drawings of a chalkboard
during recess, instantly.

[Touko]
"Why isn't anyone coming to school?!"

Until we'd get back from boarding camp, the world
seemed so severe and full of scary people.
Filled. Overflowing. Over-full.
Now, everything's disappeared.
It can't be... That's impossible.

[Touko]
"This is a dream."

All that was left was that group... The one I never
wanted to be a part of.

[Touko]
"This is the worst... I can't believe it."

If there were at least people just at the mansion,
maybe my suffering would go away.
Maybe...just maybe... If I was alone with the one I
liked...

[Touko]
"It might become a little romantic."

No one came to the classroom.
Maybe...someone from the broadcasting club would...

[Touko]
"It can't be!"

Or maybe it could be.
Even if everyone disappeared from the world,
and we were left, I wouldn't be surprised
if we disappeared any second too.
Did...everyone disappear?
Well, then so be it.
I'd disappear too. Because even if I lived alone...
This isn't reality. No way.
Just the fact that I was here is a nightmare.
My everyday...reality...my world...
It disappeared a long time ago.
No one came to the classroom.

[Touko]
"Is everyone really gone? Disappeared? Where did
they go?"

No one answered.
There's no way.
Someone, come. Come and sit next to me...
Protect me.
Don't leave me alone.

[Taichi]
"Welly well!"

Out of nowhere, Taichi arrived!
Taichi's here! Taichi's here! Taichi's here!
Was he ready to make a joke? Was this a ruse...or
kindness? He was looking at me with a big goofy
smile on his face...
It was embarrassing.
What kind of face was I even making...

[Touko]
"..."

I said nothing and just looked at him.

[Taichi]
"You grace us with your presence early today."

He started to talk to me.
Those were the first words I heard this morning.
Taichi didn't disappear. He wasn't gone.
He spoke just as if he was concerned for me.
How should I respond?
I couldn't reply, and stayed silent.
So Taichi came and sat next to me.
Don't come closer. If you come any closer now,
I might jump onto you.
I still expected something from Taichi.
But, when I did, he always betrayed me.

[Taichi]
"I can see your ass and raggedy panties."

I rushed to stand up, and held my behind with both
hands.
It wasn't messed up! Just a stupid joke!
Stupid! Stupid, stupid!
He always fooled around, but was sometimes kind.
He was always toying with me!
Taichi told me that he was going to the rooftop.
He left me alone.
As he left he said he loved me, mocking me.
Rooftop...club...broadcasting...Miyasumi.
How irritating.

[Touko]
"Everyone should have been gone though."

I had nothing to do so I left the room.
The hallway was completely empty.
I felt that no matter where I went,
no one would be there.
Even Taichi's appearance felt like an illusion now.
Maybe it was produced by my solitary heart,
a cruel illusion.

[???]
"Kirihara!"

[Touko]
"Aiee...!"

The one who called out to me was Miki Yamanobe.

[Miki]
"You going home early?"

[Touko]
"No, there's just nothing to do here."

[Miki]
"Is that so? I'm going to clean up... Want to join?"

She was so frightened just yesterday. What was she
thinking?

[Touko]
"You seem happy..."

[Miki]
"Yeah, I guess I am."

Her smile just then was too carefree.
She seemed a lot stronger now.
Maybe she really was a strong girl?
No, she's not. Because she's a student of Gunjo.
Maybe she grew up a little due to the shock of
it all.

[Miki]
"If you work a little bit, you'll calm down."

[Touko]
"I don't really feel like it."

I turned and walked away.

[Miki]
"Please wait, Princess!"

[Touko]
"Ahh!"

Miki reached out and quickly patted my butt.

[Touko]
"Why did you do that all of a sudden?"

[Miki]
"You still have work to do, Kirihara!"

[Touko]
"Why do you look like you've won or something?"

[Miki]
"You will never be able to evade Taichi's attacks!"

[Touko]
"Why are you talking about Taichi now?"

Oh yeah... She's one of the Flowers. Taichi's
always playing around with those two.

[Touko]
"Somehow, you're a lot like Taichi now."

[Miki]
"Wha? Pshh, you're making me embarrassed!"

[Touko]
"I wasn't trying to compliment you at all."

[Miki]
"Well, Taichi is kind of my master in a way."

[Touko]
"Female Taichi."

[Miki]
"Yes, I aim to be like him! Then surpass him!
Surpass the master!"

[Touko]
"No point in talking to you. I'm going home."

[Miki]
"Kirihara..."

I spun on my heel as she shouted at my back.

[Miki]
"Cheer up, girl!"

She was as annoying as him...
I couldn't take it anymore.
I didn't want to go back there after that.
A school I had no intention of going to.
A friend I didn't intend to make.
And...Taichi Kurosu.
All the messing around, him being kind
and me being happy, then him betraying me,
making me sad...I hate it.
I didn't want to see anyone. I didn't want anyone
worrying about me.
I just hated it all.
I wanted to go home, now.
Go home...go home.
But even if I went home, there was nothing to do.
I tried going to the kitchen, but I didn't know
where the food was.
I checked the pantries, but it was all utensils and
seasonings.
Luckily, I found some metal tubes with pictures of
food drawn on them, but I didn't know what to do
with them at all.
The only jars I understood were caviar. But because
it wasn't refrigerated, it wasn't fresh.

[Touko]
"Ugh! What's wrong with the food in this house!"

If I searched some more, I might find something.
But even then, I wouldn't know how to cook it.
For me, food was always served to me
in the dining room. It was something
the maids brought in.
So, even if I found something, it was meaningless.
It was the same as not having any food...
I went back to my room and got in my bed.
My throat was dry, my stomach was throbbing.
But if I endured, it would go away.
My body was getting weak and my joints hurt...
At least that's how I felt.

[Touko]
"I wonder if I'll die like this or even disappear...
I guess that's okay."

My consciousness seemed to go far away... I couldn't
think, and I felt like I was fading into nothing...

[Touko]
"Hurry... I want to hurry home."

I teared up a little.
And I noticed it was night.
Maybe I slept through my hazy consciousness.
Was this still a nightmare? Or maybe...
My body seemed to give the answer.

[Touko]
"No...strength..."

After a while, I was able to get up.
I turned on a light.
It wouldn't turn on. There was no power.
I knew that from last night. But I still had a small
lingering expectation.
My eyes got used to the darkness.
The contours of the room began to float
before my eyes.
When my vision and consciousness became sharp,
I felt the waves of discomfort hit me.

[Touko]
"What...should I do...now?"
"I wonder what everyone else is doing..."

I didn't want to see them because I couldn't stand
them and avoided them, but being alone was far too
lonely.
Taichi's okay. He's an idiot. He'd survive anywhere.
He can adapt to anyone, anywhere,
and he's fine alone.
In a world like this, he must be having a great time.
He can be friendly, fight, then be friendly again.
I'm different.
And those two, I couldn't rely on them, but they
were acting normal on the path to the mountains.
Were they trying too hard? Bluffing? Maybe, but...
Maybe Taichi will do something. I'm sure he had
something up his sleeve. But maybe...
My mood took a nosedive.
I shook my head to try to shake those thoughts away.
Youko...no reason to worry about her.
She's very strong. I don't know why
she ever came to Gunjo.
Beautiful, intelligent, super-athletic, calm
and mature. No one anyone can match. No way.
She's from another world...no way to win.
I felt depressed again.
Then, there's Miyasumi... I don't get her. Club
activities? Now? I didn't understand. Even if she
fixed the antenna, who would she broadcast to?
Even if the broadcast reached someone... Would they
come to help? Would they rescue us?
Well, maybe the others will get rescued. Not me... I
won't be.
School sucked...and I had no friends... I couldn't
get along with anyone...
No matter who reached out, I couldn't grab their
hand...because I...
Can't be saved.
What I want...is to wake up from this dream and just
go home. Next time I wake up, this nightmare will be
over.
I believed that...and slept.
Then I woke up from the shallow sleep.
My senses told me that this nightmare would continue.
I screamed as loud as I could.

[Touko]
"Someone! Is someone there?"

No answer.
My home was completely silent.
I was the only one making a sound. My stomached
panged with pain. There was no other sound.
Even in the trees and nearby mountains,
no birds sang.
That's why I sensed that today was the continuation
of yesterday...
It was still too early...
But I couldn't help but wake up this early.
Life was strict even during long vacations.
That was the Kirihara family.
Those that woke me and scolded me...
They were all gone.

[Touko]
"What am I doing here?"

Even if schools changed, the environment didn't.
Even with new friends, lovers...I never changed.
Couldn't change. Wouldn't change.
Even if the whole world changed like this,
I could never change.
That's why I...
I started making my way to school.
To prevent change, I went back to how it used to be.
In this very different world, the one thing
that didn't change was that school.
Gunjo Gakuin. The school for weirdos.
And within that school there was the broadcast club.
The weirdos among the weirdos.
That was the only thing that never changed in this
world... How ironic.
I stopped and stood around the stores near the
school.
This would be the place to find food and drinks.
I was at my limit for hunger and thirst.
Against my will, Tazaki Mart pulled my hungry
body in.
Wait, Touko!
I listened to reason and stopped.
I stopped myself from being carried away
by desire for food.
What was I trying to do at the store.
Write a stupid note like I did yesterday?
-Sep. 6 Bottled Water x 3: 420 yen,
Kirihara
The note's still probably stuck in the store.

[Touko]
"That was because it was an emergency.
I wasn't stealing. Okay?"

I whispered to myself.
I wasn't stealing, right? There was no one to pay in
the store.
If the owner reappeared someday, I'd repay him.
But that expectation was...dim.
If so, it was the same as stealing from a burned
down house.
When this all first happened, I thought maybe
everyone had evacuated due to some disaster.
But now it was different. I knew now that the people
that disappeared weren't coming back.
So I had no pride, same as a thief. 
I couldn't stand that.
But I couldn't stand an empty stomach either.
I tried to be reasonable, but my body rebelled.
I needed water and nutrients, which my body was
silently fighting for.

[Touko]
"Yeah, I'll just put up a note. Someday I'll pay it
all off...so...so..."

The desire for food moved my body.
Just an excuse. How shameful... Writing a note
as a tab was so embarrassing I wanted to hide.
If that idiot Taichi found it, he'd jump with joy.
Then he'd keep on mocking me.

[Touko]
"..."
"...I don't want to imagine it."

[Taichi]
"Wha? Hey, hey, hey! The empress took three water
bottles!"
"Shaaaameful! So saaaad! Whoa! Not just drinks!
She's taking food too! Whoa! Strange! Wild! Weird!"

[Touko]
"Wh-what? It's fine! Everyone else is doing it!"

[Taichi]
"Yup, in this state, you have to."

[Touko]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"But still! Tight-tummy Touko... Heh, that's what
I'm calling you from now on."

[Touko]
"I'll slash you!"

[Taichi]
"With your special Tight-tummy sword?"

[Touko]
"No! It's the special Harakiri Maru!"
"It's my beloved sword, Imakotetsu."
"You insulted my family honor! If you want to dirty
my family treasure, my beloved sword, a part of my
soul...then take this!"

*slash*
I cut Taichi in half with a single stroke.
As I returned the blade, my empty stomach began to
cramp.

[Touko]
"I...won't lose!"

I hazily walked to the classroom again.
I climbed the stairs and walked the hallway...
And it hurt.
I gathered my strength and sat in my seat.
My consciousness fled as I weakened
almost to disappearance.
The feeling in my body fled, and my heart fell into
darkness.
Will I disappear? Yes, who cares though.
That's what I thought.
The classroom floated in my vision.
My senses were strange. My body seemed to float.
All of this seemed so unreal.
What was this? Am I disappearing?
Or dying? Or in a dream?
All these thoughts floated across my mind
and disappeared.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Touko, are you okay?"

I saw the boy's face who called my name.
It was Taichi kindly protecting me, worrying... No!
He looked cool and shimmering... This wasn't like
him at all!

[Taichi]
"Touko?"

He looked like he was worried about my face color.
I guess this was a dream. Not reality.
Taichi's never this kind to me...
But, why was Taichi's face that close to mine?!
He reached out and held my body...
He was carrying me like some kind of princess?
I couldn't fight him off.

[Touko]
"Hey...ah... What?!"

[Taichi]
"I'm taking you to the nurse's office."

He held me effortlessly in his arms, and walked.
Reliable...strong...Taichi... No way this was him.
He put me softly on the bed and spoke.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating well?"

None of your business... I tried to say.
But...why did he look so worried?

[Taichi]
"Here, sand and witch."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

He smiled kindly and softly.

[Touko]
"Sandwich...?"

He was messing with me as usual.
But he was whispering to me with such an earnest
expression on his face.

[Taichi]
"I have water ready. Go ahead and eat the sandwich."

[Touko]
"Don't have the appetite."

This kind Taichi was fake! Had to be!
Taichi's never this kind!
My stomach growled.
Shame! A lifelong shame!
I wanted to hurry up and die on this empty stomach.
But Taichi wasn't laughing. And he wasn't mocking
me. He looked serious.

[Taichi]
"You have to eat."

I ate the sandwich and drank the water he offered.
Delicious. A moment of supreme bliss.

[Taichi]
"It was handmade."

[Touko]
"Hmph, who made it?"

[Taichi]
"I did. For you, Touko."

No way... This is a dream...a bad one.

[Taichi]
"I'm worried about you, Touko."

If it wasn't a dream, he'd be mocking me.
For sure...

[Taichi]
"I can't leave you alone. Touko, let's live
together."

Ah hah! So this was all a setup. Obviously he was
planning on pulling some stupid prank later to laugh
at me. That's why he was being so nice...
But even if this was a dream, or a lie...it felt
good to get swept away by such kindness. If this was
a dream...let me wake up to the same scene.
I fell flat on the desk and woke up.

[Touko]
"It was a dream..."

I knew it...and I was fine with it.
There was a piece of candy left on top of the desk.

[Touko]
"Why is this here?"

Only Taichi would come to this classroom...
Did he leave it?
It smelled like sweet milk...
*gulp*
I swallowed my saliva.

[Touko]
"Who do you think I am!"

I threw the candy across the room.
It was pitiful that I momentarily felt thankful for
that candy.
For a retched and pitiful girl...for me to be happy,
that Taichi blessed me with something.
And then to compare this to what the Taichi in my
dream did, it was all too embarrassing. I mean, that
Taichi brought me a handmade sandwich...
I'm not a dog! I wasn't going to wag my tail
because he gave me something!
I decisively stood and walked right out of the room.
Miki was in the hallway.

[Miki]
"Ah, Kirihara..."

It was like she'd been there waiting for me.

[Touko]
"What is it? Waiting for me?"

[Miki]
"No, not that...oh yes...Touko...I owe you. 
Would you like candy?"

She dug around in her pocket.

[Touko]
"No, I'm fine. I don't want it now."

I wanted it so bad and I was so tempted to grab it.
But I'm no dog, so I decided not to. The timing
couldn't have been worse.

[Kiri]
"Thanks for waiting."

Next, Yamanobe's classmate Kiri Sakura appeared.

[Miki]
"Kiri, you're late!"

They were supposed to meet here... Or maybe Kiri
used the bathroom.
Before coming here. I would go with friends too.
During school to the bathroom, clubs, and home.

[Kiri]
"Thanks..."

Kiri bowed a bit.
The Flowers. Two flowers, always together. Always a
couple, innocently trusting one another. But one
day, one would have to split from the other.

[Touko]
"I'm going home..."

I wasn't a flower. I couldn't connect like that just
because someone gave me candy.

[Kiri]
"Wait."

[Touko]
"What?"

[Kiri]
"Be careful with Kurosu, okay?"

[Touko]
"What do you mean?"

[Miki]
"Kiri, what are you saying?"

[Kiri]
"You can't be careless around Kurosu. I always worry
about whether you're being fooled by him or not. Or
you're being seduced by his sweet words."

[Touko]
"I realized that without you ever telling me!"

I shouted in a voice that even surprised myself.

[Miki]
"Ah, sorry, Kirihara. Kiri's just overprotective."
"She also says cruel things about Taichi."

[Touko]
"I don't have any...relationship with him."

I made that statement, and left the two.
Those flowers were looking at me like I was naive! I
was just like that since my stomach's empty! If I
was full I wouldn't be tempted.
I followed my instincts and walked to the cafeteria.
Why hadn't I noticed? Schools had cafeterias.
School cafeteria...or "schoocaf," as Taichi had
taught me once before.
There's got to be food here.
I looked around.
Seriously nothing? How?!

[Tomoki]
"What, Kirihara? Are you hungry?"

[Touko]
"Wh-what do you mean?"

Why was he here?

[Tomoki]
"There's only seasonings here. There was bread but
Sakuraba-"

[Touko]
"Whatever. I'm just passing through."

[Tomoki]
"If you are looking for food, I did find some. 
Do you want me to get it for you?"

[Touko]
"I told you I don't want any! Stop messing with me."

[Tomoki]
"Ah...Touko..."

I left the cafeteria.
Everyone's all about food. Can't tempt me though.
Tying people down with food... I won't throw away my
pride.

[Sakuraba]
"You running away now?"

Another idiot suddenly appeared.

[Touko]
"Move it. Or I'll get rid of you myself."

[Sakuraba]
"Wait...first give me candy."

[Touko]
"Wha? What are you saying?"

[Sakuraba]
"You smell like candy. Don't you get it?"

[Touko]
"Candy? I threw it away."

[Sakuraba]
"Do I sense negotiation in the air? Fine. I have
curry rolls ready."

[Touko]
"Listen to me for once."

[Sakuraba]
"You can't increase what you get. Candy prices
are stable. I'll only trade a curry roll for it.
The reason why is I threw all the other bread away."

[Touko]
"I threw the candy away in the classroom.
If you want it, go find it."

[Sakuraba]
"Heh, is that so. I'm going to get it. You'll be too
late, so don't even try getting it first."

[Touko]
"I told you, I don't want it!"

In the same way he appeared, he was suddenly gone.

[Sakuraba]
"No, I'm still here. I came back."

[Touko]
"Why are you back here...?"

[Sakuraba]
"I forgot to give you a curry roll."

A curry roll... I've never eaten one, but it's
basically curry-flavored bread, right?

[Sakuraba]
"No need for thanks. Just take it."

The idiot gave me a bag with a curry roll label
on it.

[Touko]
"I can see there's nothing inside!"

[Sakuraba]
"You noticed? Good job. Someone ate it already."
"Don't be like that. I thought you'd be happy with a
bag. Just take it."

[Touko]
"As if! Don't give me garbage!"

[Sakuraba]
"There's still the smell of curry rolls inside.
Man, I could eat five of those things."

He kept trying to push the garbage on me,
and then left, as did I.
Disgusting. I guess I can't understand others.
Or they can't understand me.
The way home was over a steep hill. I had trouble
breathing and fell down over and over again. I was
going to give up, but kept going.
I'd rather die like a dog than give up my pride.
When I felt my consciousness going, I imagined the
faces of those who mocked me. I used that angst as
energy to keep walking.
When I arrived at home, the sun had gone down a bit.
The Kirihara House. My grandfather made my father
leave the house and because we couldn't go back, I
had to go to Gunjo.
Everyone in my family showed sour faces always...
Because it was hard. Was it my fault?
I never wanted this either.
Now, no one was here. Not even bed bugs. I was alone.
I looked down on the town from above. An inconvenient
mansion. But it was the only home I could return to.
It being filled with extravagance, filled with art
and strange objects from around the world was
meaningless. None of it was useful to me now.
I went back to my room and watched the sun set.
My room, everything here was mine. It was proof that
I was living. It was my everything.
I couldn't connect with anyone. Family, friends at
my old school...nor those at Gunjo.
Taichi became my lover, and I thought I connected
with him. But I was wrong.
No one connected to my heart. No one at all.

[Touko]
"Ugh... Wait...there is someone."

Imakotetsu...my beloved sword.
The famous sword my sword-drawing expert
of a grandfather had crafted himself.
Indeed...Imakotetsu chose me.
When I put it in my hands, my sword-drawing becomes
masterful.
Even more than when my grandfather wielded it...
In my hands, Imakotetsu's sharpness glimmered.
So my grandfather gave it to me...
He basically threw the sword away.
He had never seen such sword-drawing discipline. 
I wondered if Imakotetsu and I cut through
my grandfather's heart.
Taichi tried to mock it by calling it the bewitched
Harakiri Maru or something.
It really made me angry. It wasn't funny at all.
Our family had an actual legend about Harakiri Maru,
after all.
The Kirihara clan had become extremely rich during
the years between the Warring States and end of Edo.
Both in martial arts.
Those who succeeded in war became famous, then fell
into madness and ended their own life...
All by the power of the bewitched Harakiri Maru.
My grandfather told me there really was one
buried deep in the storage room.
The make was Kotetsu...of course, all a sham.
But, it was able to cut cleanly in ways one couldn't
imagine.
So that strange legend had indeed fueled my
grandfather's interest in sword-drawing.
And the fake Kotetsu was made into this sword,
Harakiri Maru. No idea if that's true.
However, when you held it, everything was clear.
The heart became transparent.
My soul and the sword were one. A cold connection.
If anyone wanted to call it the bewitched Harakiri
Maru, they could go ahead.
It was my soul.
It cut all around me, and if I wanted to destroy
myself...
It wouldn't be Imakotetsu's fault.
It was my soul. My heart cut all around me, leading
to me getting cut right back.
And so...
I could abandon my fate to it.
This world where people crawled for food like dogs...
No pride, just living...
I'd rather become one with Imakotetsu, and decide...
Now, I felt no hunger. No thirst.
The sword would become a part of me,
and I would become part of the sword.
My soul would be whet, and could cut anything.
I got my sword, and went to the garden.
As I looked up, the sky was covered with stars.
A world with no sound...no insects crying.
No living things...this world.

[Touko]
"Impossible."

I took out Imakotetsu. It was time to let the last
light of life burn.
My body was unbelievably light, and the sword cut
masterfully.
I slashed away this reality.
I was forced to quit school, lose friends, my family
distant... Not to mention forced to go to Gunjo...I
won't accept it.

[Touko]
"No way. This is a dream."

I cut away the impossible past.
I cut away this nightmarish life.
Everything was gone.
I couldn't handle the solitude of Gunjo... Making
friends and lovers, then getting betrayed...no way!

[Touko]
"There's no way..."

I cut away the starry sky with Gunjo's colors.
I cut away the universe.
Finally...it was all over. I had cut it all away.
No thoughts remained.
I was having a nightmare.
Yeah...a terrible dream.
I cut away all of the nightmare and I felt safe.
Then I fell onto the bed.
Next time I open my eyes...I'll be in the real
world. A world not without people.
A world where I'm not a student of Gunjo. My old
school...old friends...the old world. A world I
wanted to return to.
A world where I'd never meet that idiot Taichi
again... No more mocking, insults, him being kind,
then disposing of me. A world without Taichi.
My consciousness fled from me...
Far...far...far away.
A world without Taichi?
No...I didn't want that either.
I didn't want to cut off the world nor get cut off
by it. It's not that I didn't want to accept Gunjo,
I wanted to get accepted by Gunjo.
I wanted to...connect with Taichi... Connect with
Taichi and to the world.
Now, I finally understood...I couldn't go back...
I wanted to see Taichi...one more time...
Then I entered into an eternal sleep.
