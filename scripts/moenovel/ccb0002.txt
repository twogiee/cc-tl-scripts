[Taichi]
"Okay! Okay!"

I rushed out of the house.
Putting everything on standby, preserving power
would no doubt be the right thing.

[Taichi]
"Why thank you!"

I'd normally be shy in this situation.
An office worker on his way to work.
A well-dressed student.
Groups of super young girls on their way to school.
Normally, I would be surrounded by the warm presence
of other people, but...
No one was around.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

So it wasn't a dream after all.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

No.
You haven't decided yet.
Have you?

[Taichi]
"Heheh."

I covered my mouth.
The destruction of humanity!

[Taichi]
"Heheheheh. Heheh!"

I laughed so hard.
You aren't really talking about the destruction
of humanity now, are you?
You know this is the 21st century, right?
It's passed the point of cliche.
Even if Japan fell, its islands would remain.

[Taichi]
"All right, then..."

I had laughed for a while longer and then quickly
collected myself.
I thought it'd be pointless to make such a racket
with no one around.

[Taichi]
"Ah, yeah. I think I'll pay Yusa a visit."

Couldn't begin the day without a glimpse of one of
the neighborhood's prettiest girls.
I stopped by the Doujima household. It was close.

[Taichi]
"Hey! Yusa!"

I knocked, but there was no response.

[Taichi]
"Are you there?!"

Oh yeah, the intercom.
They had a security intercom with video.
I pushed the button.
No sound.

[Taichi]
"Oh, right."

The power was out.
No TV.
No phone.
No vacuum. No fridge.
Nothing.
I knocked on the door.

[Taichi]
"Mother-in-law?"
"Yusa! Yusa!"
"I came to see you!"
"Matron..."
"Yu...sa..."

My fists fell limp.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

I headed to Yoshida's house.

[Taichi]
"Ugh!"

I was sure that savage mutt would be there.
However...

[Taichi]
"..."

The dog house was empty.

[Taichi]
"Even the dog is gone?"

Come to think of it, I hadn't seen any cats either.

[Taichi]
"Hmm. Hmm."
"This dream is strangely consistent."

I didn't care if it was a dream or not.

[Taichi]
"Guess I'll head to school."

It was my first time back in a month and a half.
The weather sure was nice.
A good day to walk to school.
A pleasant day to commute to work.
My white bangs filtered the sunlight on its way
to my eyes.

[Taichi]
"I really should have cut it..."

Oh, bother.
I wasn't a big fan of my hair, partly because of the
color.

[Taichi]
"Urgg..."

I fumbled with my hair as I traversed the hilly
commute affectionately known as The Bumpy Road.
One foot in front of the other.
And then...

[Scream]
"Aaahhhhhh?!"

What was going on?!
*KABOOM*

[Nanaca]
"Eeeeep!"

[Taichi]
"Huuuh?!"

I twisted into the shape of a ninja's shuriken and
tumbled down.

[Nanaca]
"Stop! Stop!"

[Taichi]
"Vroooooom!"

Just like that, I turned into a propeller and was
thrown onto the ground.

[Taichi]
"Nggggghhh..."

[Nanaca]
"Ohhh. I'm so sorry!"

[Taichi]
"Ooofff."

Comical Force?!
Taichi Keyword:
"Comical Force"
The first theory of ultra-science used in ascension
devices like SCARA EM and aether. Anything physical
which mitigates acceleration.
As a result, a metaphysical, comic-esque outcome
occurs. Statistically more prominent in spirited
childhood friends, it's used to maintain character.

[Taichi]
"You trying to kill me?!"

[Nanaca]
"Sorry!"

She put her hands together.

[Taichi]
"Stupid girl."

I spit the words out.

[Nanaca]
"Heh."

[Taichi]
"You seriously think you get how enthusiastic people
were about the Messerschmitt?"

[Nanaca]
"Who cares if I don't?"

[Taichi]
"Well, you seem to have a thing for making people
spin like propellers."

I swallowed my pride and headed to school.

[Nanaca]
"Hey, wait."

She came after me.
Once at my side, she hopped on her bike.

[Nanaca]
"Whoops!"

We slowly traveled side by side.
But this girl...

[Nanaca]
"Yeah. I'm okay this time. Everything's fine."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaca]
"You're really something, you know."

[Taichi]
"What?"

Was she dangerous?
Dangerous?
Well I am, too.
Maybe we all are.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Nanaca]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Jeez."

Not funny.
But who the heck was she?
By the looks of it...

[Nanaca]
"Whoops!"

She pulled a little wheelie.

[Taichi]
"Oh?!"

Panties?!
I lost my train of thought.
Unexpected eroticism was a weakness of mine.
And just like that, I completely forgot what I was
thinking about.
Stupid brain.
Whatever.

[Nanaca]
"Boy, it sure is hot today."

[Taichi]
"Well, it is summer."

[Nanaca]
"The new semester starts Monday. New hellos and
goodbyes."
"And a shrine."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

A shrine?

[Nanaca]
"Just making it so that visiting a shrine is one of
the options when this scene ends."

[Taichi]
"Nonsense. Why would that be an option?"

[Nanaca]
"You're no fun."

She looked like she was on the verge of tears.

[Taichi]
"Why do we have to go all the way to that damn
mountain? We've got school today."

[Nanaca]
"School? But nobody's there."

[Taichi]
"That's not true."

I spoke calmly.

[Taichi]
"This is a dream, so if I go to school, everybody
will be there."

[Nanaca]
"Nope. Humanity's been destroyed."

[Taichi]
"LIES!!"

[Nanaca]
"Nah, it's true."

[Taichi]
"I can't hear you! I refuse to listen to this
third-rate sci-fi drivel."

[Nanaca]
"Sci-fi drivel, huh."

[Taichi]
"That's right! And that's all I have to say about
this!"

[Nanaca]
"Your mentality is different every time I see you."

[Taichi]
"Every time you see me?"

The girl took a deep breath.

[Nanaca]
"As oddly calm as you seem to be, you're in denial
about reality."
"But not obsessing over the way things are might
prove to be your strength..."

I was grabbed by the collar. (While she was still
riding her bike.) (Skills.)

[Nanaca]
"And that's why I struggle each and every time!"

*clatter clatter*

[Taichi]
"Oww! Oww! Oww!"

[Nanaca]
"Visit the shrine! Do it for me!"

[Taichi]
"Stop! Stop the violence!"

[Nanaca]
"So the shrine then?"

[Taichi]
"I'll go! I'll go!"

Ugh... This was killing me.

[Nanaca]
"You promise?"

I nodded enthusiastically.

[Nanaca]
"Good."

She released me.

[Taichi]
*wheeze wheeze*

Probably best to go along with her.

[Taichi]
"But why the shrine?"

[Nanaca]
"It's just, there's a god there."

We briefly made eye contact.
And then, at the same time...

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahahah!"

[Nanaca]
"Ahahahahah!"

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahahahah!"

[Nanaca]
"Ahahahahahahahah!"
"Oh man, it's just soaking in god's grace!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I'll try to stop laughing."

[Nanaca]
"No, no, it's totally normal to laugh. If someone
said that to me with a straight face I'd laugh,
too."

[Taichi]
"I thought you were trying to make me laugh, saying
it like that."

[Nanaca]
"Well, maybe a little... But I'm serious, though."

[Taichi]
"About the god?"

[Nanaca]
"Yeah."
"It's important."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Nanaca]
"It just is!"

She insisted.
I didn't get this at all.

[Taichi]
"I've got you figured out."

[Nanaca]
"Is that so?"

[Taichi]
"You think I don't know who you are?"

I pushed my bangs from my eyes.

[Taichi]
"You think I can't see right through you?!"

[Nanaca]
"Uhhh..."

[Taichi]
"If you want to deceive the discerning eyes of young
cadet Taichi Kurosu, you do it with a clever but
alluring little girl!"

I triumphantly pointed my finger at her
as I announced that.

[Nanaca]
"Whoosh."

I caught a glimpse of her panties.

[Taichi]
"Whoa-whoa!"
"Whoooaaa!!"
"You're one hot bambola!!"

My nose started to bleed as I collapsed.

[Nanaca]
"Oh my."

[Taichi]
"Ahhhhh."

I was taken by surprise.

[Nanaca]
"A bloody nose? Is this some 80s romantic comedy
or something?"

[Taichi]
"Cowardly tease."

[Nanaca]
"It's because you were carelessly trying to pry."

[Taichi]
"Who wouldn't?"
"Especially when spoken to so casually by a girl
they've never met."

I stood up.

[Nanaca]
"It's not true that we've never met."

[Taichi]
"I refuse to believe that."

[Nanaca]
"*&@! stubborn."

[Taichi]
"So when did we meet then?"

[Nanaca]
"Now that's a difficult question."

The girl looked into the distance.

[Nanaca]
"I can't say for sure."

[Taichi]
"Something's been bothering me for a while now."

[Nanaca]
"Oh yeah?"

"Oh yeah?" That was her response?
She was a force to be reckoned with.

[Taichi]
"You're not an Earthling, are you?"

[Nanaca]
"Say what now?"

[Taichi]
"You're from some other planet."

[Nanaca]
"I'm from Earth."

[Taichi]
"Liar. There aren't any Earthlings like you!"
"Why are you so nonchalant?! It's not natural!"

[Nanaca]
"Nonchalant?"

[Taichi]
"It's... I don't know if it's your sudden outbursts
or your elusiveness or what! I can't explain it!
Something's not right!"
"Huh?! Just when I've finally fallen victim to your
siren song, you're going to forbid me from partaking
of its fruit?!"
"Are you a siren? You're a siren, aren't you?!"

I curled up in fear like a newborn kitten.

[Nanaca]
"Relax."

[Taichi]
"Hmm?"

She hugged me.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaca]
"You're getting a bit nervous, I see. That's good."

It was a tight hug.
The pressure turned into softness as my face sunk
into her.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh..."
"These are the mother of all hills. These hills would
form the foundation of the Roman(tic) Empire."

"Word of them spreading far and wide!"

[Nanaca]
"Stop groping me."

[Taichi]
"But it's been so long..."

[Nanaca]
"No means no."

Her knee hit me square in the stomach.
I went flying into the air.

[Taichi]
"Unngh."

Then fell to the ground.
That was incredibly awkward.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaca]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

I tried opening and closing the hand I just used to
grope her.

[Taichi]
"Something feels off. Or does it? What can I say...
Hmm..."

I could no longer understand it.
The burning sensations that came with a girl's touch
faded away.
I felt emasculated.

[Nanaca]
"Are you hurt?"

[Taichi]
"No."

Don't worry yourself to death over it.
I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Nah. You've really got the goods."

I composed myself and started fresh.

[Nanaca]
"Umm, what? No different from any other lady."

[Taichi]
"Let's just say that you have an elegance and grace
that's rare in this day and age."

There was a touch of criticism there.

[Nanaca]
"You're too kind."

[Taichi]
"And just when things started to settle down..."
"Tell me your name."

[Nanaca]
"Didn't I tell you?"

[Taichi]
"You just said you were a random passerby."

[Nanaca]
"I'm pretty sure I'd never call myself that."
"My name is Nanaca."

[Taichi]
"I'm Taichi."

[Nanaca]
"I know."

[Taichi]
"How do you know my name?"

[Nanaca]
"Heeheeheeh! That's a secret!"

This got stranger by the second.

[Nanaca]
"Well, let's leave it at that, huh."

[Taichi]
"But the question remains... What do you-"

[Nanaca]
"Bye bye!"

[Taichi]
"Wait!"

I called to her departing back.

[Nanaca]
"Say what?"

Ugh. There's something grating about the way
she talks.
She might as well be from Irkutsk, Russia with her
way with words.

[Taichi]
"I'm willing to overlook your pathetic way of
speaking, but at least admit that you came from
another planet!"

[Nanaca]
"But I told you I'm from Earth."

[Taichi]
"You lie! There's nothing Earthlingy about you!"

I went into my special Karade stance.
Karade was the ultimate fighting style.

[Nanaca]
"Heh, heh, heh."

She pointed a finger at me.

[Taichi]
"Hmm?"

No, it's something behind me.
I turned around, and stared at the school for a few
seconds.
Nothing was said.
I turned back towards Nanaca.
But she was gone.
Along with her bike.
Guess I'd just have to live without an answer to my
question.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

The new school term was quiet, with not even a
cicada singing.
