Just like usual, Mutsumi wasn't around.
Guess it made sense.
She was dead, after all.
Or was she?
It was still possible that this was just one
worldwide game of hide-and-seek.
It was a stupid theory that begged the question,
"Are you out of your frickin' mind?" But I haven't
been able to rule it out as of yet.
Abandoning production, energy, and information to
play hide-and-seek would be pretty crazy in itself.
I kept saying they've been destroyed, but it was
more like they disappeared.
Guess that explained why sweet ole Mutsumi hadn't
shown up.
The house didn't have the sense of a family at all.
It was faintly there before, but now it was
completely gone.
I took a peek at the sink.
Three tomatoes floated in a washbowl.

"Tomatoes..."

What I saw took me by surprise.
I didn't put them there.
I wasted no time eating them.
They were fresh.
The juice from the tomato spread throughout my
mouth.
They were so good I couldn't stop smiling.
Anyway, there was no food in this house.
Mutsumi always bought us ready-made food on her way
home from work.
It was rare that she had time to cook, so she rarely
kept ingredients on hand.
Come to think of it, potatoes were the only thing
I ever remembered seeing...
I saw a note on top of the desk.
"-You will need to go out for dinner."
It must be Youko.
She was trying to bait me with food.
Clearly...
Like that would ever work on me.

"Off I go."

I had to leave.
I lit a candle.
I wrote in my diary.
I wrote in detail.
For next week...
