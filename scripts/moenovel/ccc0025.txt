I often met up with Yusa on this street.
I'd become quite fond of her.
She had such a pleasant aura.
I went through a lot to become who I was today.
And Yusa's existence had healed me several times.
But she was no longer around.

[Sakuraba]
"Hey."

It was Sakuraba.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"Have you not eaten?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm prepping for first period."

[Taichi]
"Eating curry rolls is what you call a class?"

[Sakuraba]
"It sure is...until all the curry rolls are gone."

Said Sakuraba, looking cool.

[Taichi]
"Just eat some ready-made curry."

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."

[Taichi]
"..."

This guy was just really weird...
Why did he even bother coming?
It wasn't like he got knocked out of the
adaptability exam.
So maybe he used his parent's assets...

[Taichi]
"That's pointless."

[Sakuraba]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Just understanding the meaninglessness
of your existence."

[Sakuraba]
"What? Pops said that I was the world itself to him."

[Taichi]
"Well, your pop is too tepid!"

[Sakuraba]
"That's a strange way of being told that..."

[Taichi]
"I'm mourning the loss of Combat."

[Sakuraba]
"Heh... Thanks to that I'm commuting
to school at ease."

[Taichi]
"You should go through more hardship. Buy some
hardship with that money of yours. And take some
damage from those hardships too."

[Sakuraba]
"That's a complicated request."

I walked to school with Sakuraba.
Then.

[Sakuraba]
"Hexshoo!"

[Taichi]
"Hexagonal sneeze?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Summer cold, I guess." *sniff*

Not controversial, just a sneeze.

[Sakuraba]
"Mrrr."

It was a small surprise from something passing into
Sakuraba's vision.
Sakuraba and I had a bridge between us.
One side was connected to my uniform,
just around my chest.
The other side was on Rubber's nose.
In other words...

[Sakuraba]
"Heh..."

He laughed fearlessly.
A bridge of snot.
A long strand of liquid...
Hung...
And created a bridge between us.
I had a working theory about what had happened:
When he sneezed, a volley of snot shot out
faster than a bullet train and hit my uniform.
The snot stuck strongly, and formed a bridge
between me and his nostril, and though
something like it would normally break, it didn't.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

It looked like he was able to read the air.
His face seemed refreshed.
No one moved.
His thought, probably, was that he let all the
snot out and his nose is completely clean...
I could bet on it.

[Taichi]
"Hey... Snotface."

Gave him a title that a grade schooler
would've come up with.

[Sakuraba]
"Ahhh... Huh?"

Maximum relaxation.
Sakuraba was air-headed.
This bastard!
I decided to add some trauma to this little brat.
I should have forced him to be a little more like
a Gunjo kid.
The blood of the Atlantis Empire started to boil.
Before Sakuraba could react, I calmly pulled
out a handkerchief.
And first, I wrapped it around Sakuraba's nose.

[Sakuraba]
"Hrn?"

He let out a disgustingly cute voice.
After wiping the top, I then wiped under the nose
several times.
I wiped up the rest of the snot bridge, and then
wiped my own uniform.
Then put the handkerchief back into my pocket...
Nope, shoved it on Sakuraba's face.

[Sakuraba]
"Arrrrrrgggggggg?!"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Sakuraba]
"Isn't...that...a little...dirty?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

I smiled brightly.

[Taichi]
"You are too."

I drilled it to his face.

[Sakuraba]
"Arrgarrgarrgarrgh."

I shoved it in his face again and again.

[Sakuraba]
"Arrgarrgarrgarrgh."

It was a scene from hell.

[Taichi]
"It's not a kind of handkerchief that leaves me
crying my precious self to sleep."

I spoke with a very dark voice.

[Sakuraba]
"Hngh!"

Sakuraba's body shook.
His mind must have shorted out due to the
mucus sensation.
I let him fall to the ground with the handkerchief
still on his face.

[Taichi]
"You can sneeze hexagonally or however you want,
Sakuraba, but be careful of summer colds."

Stepped on his head and started walking.

[Taichi]
"Ugh, seriously..."

[Sakuraba]
"We just made another memory together."

He walked next to me as if everything was cool.

[Taichi]
"You should take a little damage at least!!"

One handkerchief just gained me Sakuraba's
friendship.
