And just like that it was noon.
Not a lot of encounters with just the eight of us.
Youko's sandwiches.
There was a bit too much.

[Taichi]
"Can't be helped, I guess I'll eat them myself."

"I should be able to eat them all, I'm still in my
growth period."
I suddenly got goosebumps on my back.
It felt like a soldier with a machine gun was aiming
at me from behind.

[Taichi]
"Y-Youko..."

[Youko]
"..."

She stood.
She only stood there.
Her usual approach.
Being sharp on presence might just be an attribute,
but it was hard to get used to it.

[Taichi]
"Abrupt as usual."

[Youko]
"..."

I pinched her nose shut.

[Taichi]
"Speak."

[Youko]
"I thought you needed me (muffled)."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

I thought about it.

[Taichi]
"Not really."

[Youko]
"..."

As soon as I let go, she leapt back about two meters.
Tsk.

[Taichi]
"It's not like I can eat enough for two by myself."

I opened the paper bag and took a bite out of one
of the sandwiches.

[Youko]
"..."

I wondered what kind of things were going on behind
that mask of hers.
But then, her shoulders drooped.
And then looked downhearted.

[Youko]
"I decided to leave my apartment..."

[Taichi]
"Huh, why?"

[Youko]
"I'm going home."

[Taichi]
"My house?"

She nodded.

[Taichi]
"No..."

I called her out.

[Youko]
"...Why not?"

[Taichi]
"I don't feel comfortable."

[Youko]
"Since no one is here anymore...I thought I could go
back to the way it was..."

[Taichi]
"I think we should just live amongst ourselves."

Our views split.
She gave a sour face (Youko version, almost
expressionless).

[Youko]
"...You're always so unkind to me"

[Taichi]
"You're just too overprotective."

[Youko]
"I'm just doing what's normal."

I understand, but...

[Taichi]
"No. I'm going to fully enjoy living alone."

[Youko]
"Is that so..."

Again, downhearted.
I continued eating my sandwich, with the downhearted
girl next to me.

[Youko]
"..."

She stared at me.

[Youko]
"..."

Continued to stare.

[Youko]
"..."

Her stare pierced me.
Then her stomach growled.

[Taichi]
"...Did you have lunch?"

[Youko]
"No."

[Taichi]
"That's too bad."

[Youko]
"I thought you said it can't be helped to eat all of
it by yourself."

[Taichi]
"I did."

*munch munch munch*

[Taichi]
"Just what I'm doing now."

[Youko]
"But there are two people here."

[Taichi]
"What's that? I couldn't hear you very well."

[Youko]
"You're always so mean to me..."

[Taichi]
"Wow, this is good."

*munch munch munch*

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It's really good."

*munch munch munch*

[Youko]
"..."

Two of us in an unpopulated hallway. My chewing,
Youko's stomach growling, and the paper bag, 
chorded in perfect harmony.
An unexplainable tension swelled in the area.
