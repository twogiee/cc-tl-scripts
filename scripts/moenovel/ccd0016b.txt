[Taichi]
"I must thank you, Miki."

[Miki]
"No, no, it was nothing..."

Despite her words, she fidgeted with anticipation.
A shy heart coated in lust.
To some extent, with me being also filled with lust,
I could live without giving in to pressures.
I took Miki's hand in mine.

[Taichi]
"Je t'aime..."

I kissed the back of her hand.

[Miki]
"Waaah..."

She demurely accepted my affection.
Miki was weak to being treated like a princess.
I kissed her hand once more.

[Miki]
"No, please..."

It seemed like she was enjoying it despite her
words.

[Kiri]
"..."

The pressure I felt from Kiri was staggering.
I showered Miki with kisses.

[Miki]
"What a wonderful treat!"

I then wrapped my arms around her shoulders.

[Miki]
"Hwuh?"

I took her hair in my hand, and drew her lips closer
to mine.

[Miki]
"This is like something out of a movie...
Or a romantic cruise..."

[Taichi]
"Love to the third power."

[Miki]
"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but our
synergy blends so well."

I turned her to hold her from behind,
and rubbed my cheek against hers.

[Miki]
"Hyah?"

Even still, Miki put up no resistance.

[Kiri]
"Nnng..."

Kiri's aura was now turning into a physical presence.

[Taichi]
"I'm afraid I've fallen for your charms, Miki."

[Miki]
"Ah, r-really?"

[Taichi]
"You have something in your eyelashes.
Close your eyes real quick."

[Miki]
"Yeah..."
"My heart's racing..."

Ah, I could easily steal a kiss.
I changed my plans.

[Taichi]
*smooch*

[Kiri]
"I won't let you!!"

Kiri leapt at me.

[Taichi]
"Wh-wha?!"

[Miki]
"Aiiieeee?!"

[Kiri]
"You pervert!!"

[Taichi]
"Gwaaah!"

And so I failed to steal Miki from Kiri.
