I continued working.
Miki and Kiri hadn't shown up.
I guess that was to be expected.
In some ways, I was the weird one for still coming
to school.
But what about Misato?
It would be lunchtime soon.
I had raided Tomoki's stash for some cup noodles.
I boiled water on the roof while munching
on a cucumber.
This wasn't how I imagined club would be...
I had almost forgot.
That mankind was no more.
A world with only eight people. Well, seven now.
A precarious state of affairs.
I poured hot water into the cup noodles.
I ate.

[Misato]
"Oh, it's you, Pekke."

She was finally here.

[Taichi]
"Good morning. You're late."

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

She seemed down.
Her glasses drooped downward.

[Taichi]
"Something bad happened, didn't it?"

[Misato]
"Yeah...real bad..."

I sat near here and stared up at the sky.

[Taichi]
"It might help to talk about it."

[Misato]
"Tomoki and I had a fight."

[Taichi]
"Ah, Tomoki, huh. I fight with him, too."

She let off a tired smile.

[Misato]
"This fight was a little different."

[Taichi]
"Tough home life, huh?"

She shook her head meekly.

[Misato]
"It's a sibling rivalry sort of thing...
We just can't get along."

[Taichi]
"He's also more stubborn than he looks."

[Misato]
"That might be my fault..."

My silence urged her on.

[Misato]
"I nag him too much."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Misato]
"It's all my fault..."

She played with her bangs in self-deprecation.

[Taichi]
"Same as me, then."

[Misato]
"Really...?"

[Taichi]
"I'm bad, too. Why else would I be here?"

[Misato]
"Heheh. We should both be suspended."

[Taichi]
"Fine as long as I'm with you."

[Misato]
"So should we both get suspended
and do something wicked?"

She smiled like an innocent little girl.

[Taichi]
"Wicked? Yeah, that..."

The metal door opened with a shriek.

[Kiri]
"Get away from him!!"

Kiri came armed.
And it was definitely not a water gun.

[Misato]
"Huh...?"

[Kiri]
"Please get away from him, Misato!"

[Misato]
"Huh? From Pekke? Don't talk to your seniors
like that. Maybe you need some time off."

[Kiri]
"He's dangerous! Hurry!"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"That water gun... Is it some kind of water bowgun?"

[Taichi]
"That's the real thing."

[Misato]
*gasp*

She fainted.

[Taichi]
"That was quick."
"It's all your fault."

[Kiri]
"Taichi Kurosu..."

Kiri aimed the crossbow at me.

[Taichi]
"Angry again, huh. So what are you gonna do?"

[Kiri]
"You killed Kirihara, too!"

[Taichi]
"?!"

Touko...

[Taichi]
"Hey, wait..."

[Kiri]
"I went to see her, and she was dead...
It had to be you!"

[Taichi]
"What?! You're serious? Touko is really dead?"

[Kiri]
"First Hasegawa, now Kirihara... Who's next?"

[Taichi]
"How did she die?"

[Kiri]
"You already know."

[Taichi]
"Was she wounded? Where did it happen?"

[Kiri]
"Touko's house. Her own room."
"A single stab wound to the chest."
"You did it. I know you did."

She was jumping to conclusions.
My existence and Youko's death confused Kiri.
It also excited her.
No point in trying to persuade her.
I wasn't too afraid of her crossbow.
Because she couldn't fire it rapidly.
Miss once, and it would be game over.
And it'd be very hard to hit a running target.
I'd easily subdue her.

[Taichi]
"You give me no choice."

Such a regrettable way to die.
Trying to get her to misfire, I focused all my
energy into my legs, and moved as fast as I could.

[Miki]
"Don't do it, Kiri!"

Miki grabbed Kiri from behind.

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

The arrow flew.

[Taichi]
"Hn?!"

It narrowly missed me as it flew past.
The arrow quivered as it struck the wall of the tool
shed.

[Miki]
"Don't do it."

[Kiri]
"But-!"

[Taichi]
"I appreciate the help, Miki.
But please be careful..."

[Miki]
"Ah yeah, sorry."

[Kiri]
"Don't come any closer!"

I closed the distance between us and grabbed Kiri.

[Taichi]
"I'm not even going to do anything to you."
"...Though I'd love to send you flying."

I let her go.
Kiri fell down on her butt.

[Kiri]
"Murderer...!"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Miki]
"Stop it, you two. You're gonna make me laugh."

[Kiri]
"Murderer! Who are you gonna murder next?!"

[Taichi]
"You're not making sense right now. I didn't even
know about Touko, but you automatically assume it
was me."

[Kiri]
"Who else could it be...?!"

[Taichi]
"You maybe? You found her..."

Kiri's eyebrows bristled.

[Kiri]
"I'd never do such a thing.
You're the only one who could!"
"Die! Die! If you're gonna kill, kill yourself!
Go to hell! There's only eight of us...
What are we doing here?!"
"Die! Die, you murderer! You brute!"

Her voice was grating to hear.
It left me feeling dejected.

[Taichi]
"You're not very pretty right now..."

It was like the rusty knife version of her.
She was clumsy at the moment.
Not the least bit of precision.
No delicacy.
When did she become so hopeless?

[Taichi]
"..."

You're losing interest, aren't you?

[Kiri]
"Those eyes... They aren't human..."

She brought up my eyes.
Was she attacking me?
She was, wasn't she?
Maybe it was time to flip the switch.
It was as good a time as any.
If she was the enemy...
I looked at Kiri.
Maybe I should take her out?

[Kiri]
"Eek..."

She seemed to "understand" me. She had a good eye.
She momentarily turned pale.
Humans died easily.
No need to stab them.
Even easier with that slender neck of hers.

[Miki]
"Enough already! Enough!"

Miki pulled Kiri's skirt up.

[Kiri]
"Ahhhhhh!!"

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

It whetted my appetite.

[Taichi]
"They're striped!"

I had the sudden urge to yell out like a umpire.

[Taichi]
"STRIKE OUT!"
"Aww man, I had a feeling they'd be striped."

My first decent panties in a while.

[Miki]
"Back to normal, then? Hurrah!"

[Kiri]
"What... What the hell are you doing?"

[Miki]
"He was angry, and you were acting oddly."
"I was just trying to stop you two, that's all."

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'm leaving. I need to see Touko for myself."

[Miki]
"Okay. Leave little miss striped panties to me."

[Taichi]
"She's all yours."

I left the rooftop.
