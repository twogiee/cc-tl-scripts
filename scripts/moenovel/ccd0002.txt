It was a bolt out of the blue.
I was in my first year of high school when I met
Sakuraba again.

[Sakuraba]
"Do you remember me?"

[Taichi]
"...Huh?"

[Sakuraba]
"From the play during the school festival?"

[Taichi]
"You..."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm Hiroshi Sakuraba."
"I don't like being called by my family name, so
call me Hiro instead."

His face did seem familiar.
And it left me with some bad memories.
...

[Taichi]
"Don't touch me."

[Sakuraba]
"...Does it bother you?"

[Taichi]
"Of course it does."

[Sakuraba]
"Sorry."

[Taichi]
"No need to apologize. Just don't come any closer."

[Sakuraba]
"Forgive me."

[Taichi]
"As if. Don't talk to me again."

[Sakuraba]
"Anyway, on the internet yesterday..."

[Taichi]
"..."

He doesn't leave. He doesn't learn.
He doesn't back off.
That was the kind of guy Sakuraba was.
...

[Sakuraba]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"I told you not to talk to me."

[Sakuraba]
"Did you finish your assignment?"

[Taichi]
"Can you not hear out of your ears?"

[Sakuraba]
"Actually, I can't. From one side."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Sakuraba]
"That was a pretty good whack you gave me."

I did remember hitting him.
But, that was to protect my virginity.

[Taichi]
"And? It was self-defense."

[Sakuraba]
"True. You weren't in the wrong."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"I was just being immature back then."
"Come to think of it...I was really moved."
"You were so beautiful on the stage."

[Taichi]
"Ah, is that so? Thanks. Even though it doesn't make
me feel better at all."

[Sakuraba]
"Relax. There's not a single corrupt bone in this
body."

[Taichi]
"...If you say so."

[Sakuraba]
"Seriously there isn't. I was just feeling some kind
of way back then."
"It seems like that controllable feeling that I had
at time just disappeared."

[Taichi]
"That just means you're impotent."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, you're right."

He laughed about it.
...

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"You again?"
"I was feeling relieved that you had left for a
while."

[Sakuraba]
"I was away digging up fossils."

[Taichi]
"Say what?"

It was indecipherable.

[Sakuraba]
"I was thinking I'd found an ammonite, but it turned
out to be beetle larva."

[Taichi]
"You're an idiot."

...
It was a day I missed out on lunch.
All the lunch tickets and bread were sold out.

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, need company?"

[Taichi]
"..."

*plunk*

[Taichi]
"What are you doing?"

A mountain of the school bread was now before me.

[Sakuraba]
"I bought all the types."
"Let's find the best tasting one."

[Taichi]
"...Do it yourself."

[Sakuraba]
"You can eat too."

[Taichi]
"Nah."

[Sakuraba]
"I can't eat all these myself."
"Hey. These curry rolls are unbelievably good!"

[Taichi]
"..."

I gave in.

[Taichi]
"Bleeeh! Gross, man!"

It was disgusting.

[Taichi]
"Stop messing with me!"

[Sakuraba]
"Well this pork cutlet sandwich sucks. Here."

I gave in.

[Taichi]
"This one...tastes good?"

[Sakuraba]
"Really? Your taste buds are weird."

You mean YOURS are.
...
School days at Gunjo were long.
Even when classes finish, the main gate
stays closed for 30 minutes.
The 30 minute wait in front of it was always
so boring.

[Sakuraba]
"Going home?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

Sakuraba walked up next to me.

[Sakuraba]
"Birds are nice. Next time I'm reborn, I'll be a
bird."

He confessed out of nowhere.

[Taichi]
"Well, your mind is already sky high with the
birds."

[Sakuraba]
"Hahahah!"

[Taichi]
"Don't you get that I'm just being sarcastic?"

...
I became a member of the broadcast club.
It was the first day I showed up in the club room.

[Taichi]
"And...so you're here."

[Sakuraba]
"We can hang out now."

[Taichi]
"I really don't want to."

Anyway, Tomoki came a little late.
Misato was a recruiter, it seemed.

[Tomoki]
"I'm Tomoki Shima...nice to meet you."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm Hiroshi Sakuraba. I don't like being called by
my family name. Call me Hiro instead."

[Tomoki]
"Well...maybe one day."

He made him timid quickly.
...
We spent the specified amount of time in the club
room.
That was the rule.

[Tomoki]
"No, it's not that... Why do you make mistakes on
purpose?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because it makes things interesting."

[Tomoki]
"Chess is about winning or losing though."

[Sakuraba]
"I play how I want to."
"Hey, Taichi...you want to play?"

[Taichi]
"...Nah."

I shrugged my shoulders.

[Tomoki]
"...I think Kurosu's too weird."

[Sakuraba]
"Really? I like him."

I could hear them whispering.
And I wish they'd stop.
I wanted to scream.
...

[Tomoki]
"It was your job!"

[Taichi]
"It's like I'm obligated to do it."

[Tomoki]
"Of course you are. You're a club member."

[Taichi]
"Let me go, you sister-complex having loser!"

As soon as I insulted him, Tomoki Shima
became enraged.

[Tomoki]
"You...!"

We got into a fight.
I mounted him.
What an amateur...!
I then started punching him.
I went easy on him.
I punched him so he wouldn't get hurt but could
still feel the pain.
As I punched, I got bored.
I was getting tired of playing around.
Just then, I felt someone looking at me.

[Taichi]
"What are you looking at?"

[Sakuraba]
"Oh, nothing in particular."

[Taichi]
"You see something funny?"

[Sakuraba]
"Just something normal you'd expect to see at a
school."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"What's wrong? Fight all you want if it makes you
feel better."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

I stood up.

[Taichi]
"I'm done. This is stupid."

[Tomoki]
"Hey, get to work!"

So annoying...

[Taichi]
"Okay, okay, I will."

[Tomoki]
"Good...that's all I wanted from the beginning."

[Taichi]
"I don't know what to do. How should I even know?"

[Tomoki]
"It's not that hard to just ask."

He said it like it was obvious.
He was bleeding from his lips.
I can see in his face that he was in pain, but
Tomoki didn't complain about it.

[Sakuraba]
"HEY!"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Sakuraba]
"...Are you feeling better?"

[Taichi]
"..."
"Get to work."

...
If I help, it's all the same.

[Sakuraba]
"Yo."

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Sakuraba]
"What a shock."

[Taichi]
"What's up? Were you on the front page of the school
newspaper again?"

[Sakuraba]
"There was a dead cat."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Sakuraba]
"A car ran over it. Not good, man, not good
at all."

[Taichi]
"Ran over...? Hey...why are you crying?"

[Sakuraba]
"I don't know...maybe because of the cat..."

[Taichi]
"What the..."

[Sakuraba]
"I can't stop."
"...I really can't stop."

Surprisingly, he was naive.
Only under his standards though.
...
Then, after a while...

[Sakuraba]
"Wow, what a shock."

[Taichi]
"What is it this time?"

[Sakuraba]
"It seems like I'm the laughing stock
of the whole school."

[Taichi]
"You just now noticed?"

I went in on him again...

[Taichi]
"You should have known."

[Sakuraba]
"Am I that absurd?"

He might just be slow in noticing the ill will of
people.
Wow.
I was afraid he would get crushed by it someday.
Or so I thought, at one time.
It was actually the complete opposite.
Even if he got mentally beaten up, he stayed tough
and came back to life.
When he got beaten to a certain point, he'd
do anything to heal himself.
Traveling, dancing, performing.
And after a week, he'd usually come back around.
...
That's how the both of us started to hang out.
The sacred oath between us would be decided
soon after...
