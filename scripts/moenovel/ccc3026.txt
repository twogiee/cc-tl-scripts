[Taichi]
"And that son was Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri couldn't respond.
Her hands had stopped trembling.
But...that didn't mean she had calmed down.
She was looking at me with an astonished expression.
She didn't even realize that the arrowhead was no
longer pointing at me.

[Taichi]
"You may have caught it, but the 'S' stands for
Shinkawa."

[Kiri]
"Wh-what are you saying...?"

She could only half-contain a smile.
She couldn't even keep her emotions in check.

[Taichi]
"He was taught such things as a child. I knew he
wouldn't lead a normal life."

[Kiri]
"You're lying!!"

Her voice was shrill.

[Kiri]
"You're lying, lying lying lying!! Don't you dare
say that to me! Such nonsense..."

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."

Her hands began to tremble again.

[Kiri]
"That never happened! Yutaka would never do such a
thing!"

[Taichi]
"It did happen and Yutaka did do such a thing."
"He was the most enthusiastic."

I laughed.

[Taichi]
"Well, since he was a child, it was probably
difficult for him to have a fully-grown woman as a
companion. That's why..."

[Kiri]
"Shut up!!"

Her voice began to crack.

[Kiri]
"He never once spoke about that! Even after all the
time we spent living together. It's not possible. I
can't even imagine..."

[Taichi]
"The memory loss."

Those words immediately shut Kiri's mouth tight.
I felt like a great detective, giving her such a
revelation.

[Taichi]
"The whole mystery has been solved, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"But that...having no memories..."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, I also know why his legs are injured."

[Kiri]
"Huh..?"

[Taichi]
"It's because I was there."

[Kiri]
"So... Taichi...you knew about him...?"

[Taichi]
"Not at all."
"I didn't think Yutaka even survived... Also, I
didn't even remember his name."
"It was coincidence that I met him..."
"I was forced into a girl's outfit as well... He
didn't seem to realize."

Nevertheless, Yutaka survived.

[Taichi]
"Then things happened, I was released...
After some twists and turns I ended coming here."
"But if you think about it, it's quite obvious."
"For Yutaka and I, there's no way such a thing would
mess us up."
"It was inevitable that we met."

[Kiri]
"Yutaka... He would never do such a cruel thing... I
can't believe it."

[Taichi]
"I had only realized it after he and I had become
close."

[Kiri]
"So that's why...you killed him?"

Yeah, I couldn't lie to her any further.
It made me want to spill it all out.

[Taichi]
"I wasn't filled with such intent immediately."
"It was something that happened in the past."

[Kiri]
"If that's so, then...!"

The tides began to turn.
A wave of emotion struck her, and it washed back
over me.
Kiri.
You're the one who attacked me first.

[Taichi]
"If he was regretting what he did, I thought of
letting him go."
"But he seemed so happy when we were hanging out."

[Kiri]
"...!!"
"That day...when you asked me that question...
If he was happy...?"

[Taichi]
"You remember well."
"That's right. That's exactly what it meant."

And so now the question was raised again.

[Taichi]
"Hey Kiri... Do you think Yutaka was happy?"

A common question.
However...
This time it had an opposite meaning.

[Kiri]
"He was going through hard times!!"
"His family was cold-hearted... He was in a bad
place..."

[Taichi]
"Did he really always have a hard time?"
"Were there no moments of happiness?"

[Kiri]
"That's..."

[Taichi]
"There were. Right?"

Kiri wouldn't reply. She just hung her head.
Her weapon had lowered as well.
Her animosity and bloodlust were spent.
She was like a withered flower.
Her slight form was filled with poisonous doubts.

[Taichi]
"That's the way it goes. If you forget about the
past, your heart would be clean. Nothing can get in
the way of your happiness then!"
"That's why I made him remember."

[Kiri]
"Stop it..."

Kiri tried covering her ears.

[Taichi]
"Don't shut me out!"

Her hands stopped.

[Taichi]
"It was a beautiful day."
"As you saw, on the rooftop we were talking it out."

[Kiri]
"Ugh."

[Taichi]
"At that time, he asked me, 'What can I do to make
you forgive me?'"
"It's not about forgiveness. A sin is something that
can never be undone. It's untouchable and
unalterable. I had no will to condemn him."
"I just had one question for him..."
"And so I asked him."
"Hey, one question...why don't you die now?"
"That's what I said to him..."

[Kiri]
"No..."

[Taichi]
"Then... Yutaka actually committed suicide."

Kiri collapsed.
I squatted down beside her.
A pitying smile was etched on my face.

[Taichi]
"In the end, there's one thing we can be sure about."

Just a bit more, and she would be broken.
I knew this, and still...
I whispered in her ear.
To give her the critical blow with my deadly weapon.

[Taichi]
"Your brother was a filthy piece of shit."

[Kiri]
"..."

*snap*
I knew that something within Kiri had broken.
And it could never be fixed.
