Well then.
I went to the rooftop and adjusted Tomoki's corpse.
I tried pulling out the antenna but the corpse
already was stiff.

[Taichi]
"Stubborn crap."

Just as I said.
I tried to sit him in a chair, but then again, the
corpse already was stiff.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

I had no choice so I grabbed his ankles, stepped on
his shoulders and pulled him out flat.
His corpse made a cracking sound.
Sorry, Tomoki's corpse.
Or maybe "no-soul-Tomoki."
I took the flattened Tomoki and put him up on the
fence.

[Taichi]
"Okay, Tomoki! We're club buddies now!
We can do this together!"

[Tomoki]
"..."

No response. Like a corpse.
Well...he was a corpse.
The antenna was broken.
Yeah, now I get it.
Tomoki went to destroy the antenna.
He... He had a grudge towards his sister, Misato.
He disturbed her.
Then the broken antenna fell...on Tomoki.
She went to the rooftop and found her brother's dead
body.
Then...she fell.
Tomoki was accidentally killed.

[Taichi]
"It's all because of you this antenna is short now."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Really? You're just going to shut up?"

Well then.
I had fun talking to Tomoki's corpse and decided to
actually work on the club.
I adjusted the mic's height.
Power on.
The frequency... I guess it's fine as is.
Yup, as is.
Just do this...and this...and there.
I began broadcasting.

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm..."
"Hmm, I wonder what I should say."

I reflected on it.
I didn't really have an advocacy or else.
Mm...
Okay!

[Taichi]
"Hello, this is... Gunjo Gakuin... Broadcasting
Club... Red Scorpion. I'm thinking of stinging you
many times over."
"Today we're on our way to hell and our guest is the
dead Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"He's a cool, shy boy."
"Well..."
"Anyway, is there anyone...alive?"
"If you are, well, keep living."
"Keep living until you die."
"After all, all our sense of values are established
while you are alive, right, Dead Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"He's a super reticent guy."
"Well, it's okay to die..."
"Human relationships I guess is more important than
I thought it is."
"Like their influences is what creates you."
"That's what I feel personally, what about you?"
"It's fine if you can live alone. That means you are
strong enough."
"But most people are weak, including me."
"If you're really alone, I think it will definitely
destroy you."
"It's a world full of evil, after all."
"Well mostly evil, I mean."
"Even so...someone's there."
"Someone other than you."
"That's-"

[Miki]
"People only care about themselves, Taichi."

I stopped.
I looked.
It was Miki.

[Taichi]
"Miki...?"

[Miki]
"I placed your notebook on the shrine."

[Taichi]
"And?"
"Is your time okay?"

[Miki]
"Just a bit more, I think."

[Taichi]
"This is bad. You should go back."

She was covered in sweat.
Did she run all the way here?
But for what.

[Miki]
"Ah, do you think I can make it in time if I go back
now?"

[Taichi]
"What are you doing? Hurry and go!"

[Miki]
"When I'm done with my errand, I'll go. Because I'm
someone with a lot of beautiful attributes."

[Taichi]
"Errand?"

I tightened up.

[Miki]
"Taichi, this world...is not the world we were in."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Miki]
"Read this. It's the easiest to understand."

She took out a thick journal.

[Miki]
"From page 52."

I read it.
Day __ Month __
It's been a month since we confirmed this
large-scale disappearance had begun.
In an instant, everyone disappeared.
When did they all disappear?
How did they all disappear?
No one saw the moment of their disappearance.
Nobody has had the time to clarify why.
The population of Kamisaka City was now less than
half.
The school population dropped.
But this student, Kurosu, was the same as usual.
Even in this critical situation, he's living and
going nuts as usual.
He had a serious disease, but he looked very healthy.
Will it be ironic if I disappeared?
Day __ Month __
Studies have become optional.
It was hopeless since only one tenth of the school
population remained.
In my home, I played around with my figurines.
But there was no one to see, no one to love.
It was merely just to satisfy myself.
I'm glad my family was gone.
But because of their disappearance, I'm unlikely to
endure all these alone.
The power plants stopped making power. Of course.
Day __ Month __
I got rid of my figurines.
For my hobbies to be gone too because of people's
disappearance.
I didn't felt like something was to happen.
The world was stable.
That was connected to my happiness towards my
hobbies.
I used to hate people, but now I'm connected to the
world.
I guess I'll try to live normally.
I'll be able to find food too as everyone
disappeared.
Bartering had increased.
I wanted to eat a huge load of steak.
Day __ Month __
I barely saw people even when I went out to the
town.
I wondered if there was anyone left.
I began wandering around.
Television didn't work anymore.
Radios were all static, nothing to listen to.
Silence. It drove you crazy.
Day __ Month __
I didn't see anyone today.
Day __ Month __
A supply truck came.
But the driver wasn't there.
I looked for someone, but there was no one.
There was only a truck with its engine running.
Scared. I'm scared.
Day __ Month __
I took the goods from the truck.
It was all bread.
But I didn't need the curry rolls.
I took what I wanted to my house.
I took the curry rolls to the school.
If someone's left, they can eat it.
Day __ Month __
I didn't see anyone today.
Day __ Month __
Is no one here?
Day __ Month __
I met Miki Yamanobe.
I was so relieved.
But she drew back. She wouldn't talk to me.
She was talking about Kurosu.
Kurosu is dangerous?
I didn't understand.
She ran away.
I looked for her until night, but couldn't find her.
Day __ Month __
Miki Yamanobe was dead.
She was killed, by someone.
Kurosu?
Maybe that was what she meant by him being
dangerous.
He definitely has severe problems with adapting.
I wonder what the cause is.
I want to meet someone.
I'm thinking of looking for Kurosu tomorrow.
Anyone is fine.
The writing stopped.

[Taichi]
"Is this...Sakakibara's journal?"

[Miki]
"I found it a while ago...when I was looking around."
"This is a different world."
"The same one, but different."
"A world in which no one lives...an empty one."
"We were sent here. Maybe, on our way back from
training camp."

My heart skipped a beat.
Way home from training camp.
Well, then...
That meant...

[Taichi]
"Where did you find it?"

[Miki]
"There were several diaries on each houses, but this
is the easiest to understand."
"Means the world's were in is different from
Sakakibara's."
"And, I think that Sakakibara was killed as well."
"There was blood all over the hallway of the school."

[Taichi]
"So it was me...then."

[Miki]
"You, from this world."

[Taichi]
"I did..."

[Miki]
"You from this world, though!"

[Taichi]
"But it's me."

I dropped the journal.

[Taichi]
"Jeez...this sucks."

[Miki]
"I'm fine with it."

She embraced me.

[Miki]
"So, relax."

I hugged her back.
That little Miki made me feel a great sense of
relief.

[Taichi]
"So the worlds are mixing."

And the intersection was this world's week.
How preposterous...like science fiction.
But.

[Taichi]
"You came back just to tell me this?"

[Miki]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"It's pointless, though."

[Miki]
"Yes, I just noticed."

[Taichi]
"You're lying..."

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Stupid."

[Miki]
"Because..."
"I'm in love with you."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"I fell in love..."
"With the current Taichi!"

She embraced me again. Tightly.

[Miki]
"Taichi from this world..."
"I didn't know how it felt to fall in love with
others..."
"And I never thought it would be this painful!"
"My heart keeps...throbbing."
"The tears well up."
"My nose drips."
"My face gets all messed up, and I can't control my
heart."
"I don't know any explanation..."
"But it's warm..."

[Taichi]
"I'm thankful...but don't you love Kiri?"

[Miki]
"I think I do..."
"But now, she's broken."
"I've killed Kiri...many times."
"In order for me to survive...I used Kiri. She was
the only one who could take up your consciousness
when you're going nuts."

In order to break through my defenses.

[Miki]
"I had to desperately survive from the monsters, You
and Youko."

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

[Miki]
"I'm tired..."
"I don't...want to kill anymore."
"It's hard...doing that."
"Every time I kill Kiri...I know that my heart's
quietly slipping away."
"And to live with the memories piled up...I'd have
to endure... It's..."

She spat the words.

[Miki]
"It's hell."
"That's why...I...decided."
"I'll forget...everything."

It sounded dignified.
She nobly stated her decision.

[Taichi]
"You're a good girl, Miki..."

[Miki]
"I'm broken though... I didn't even thought of
others as people..."

[Taichi]
"But you're better than I am."
"Compared to a pitiless beast like me, you're worth
something."

[Miki]
"..."

With words.
I tried to knock on Miki's heart.
As if my words had fists.
Quietly.

[Taichi]
"You don't have any talent."

[Miki]
"Ahaha, hahah..."
"Hahah, you think? Hahah..."

She laughed weepingly.

[Taichi]
"Our three person date, it was fun."

[Miki]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"You got lonely living alone, right?"

[Miki]
"No, that's not it. I take care of myself first."

[Taichi]
"That's also not true."
"I've figured you out at last..."

But it will all become pointless.
I would have sacrificed anything and everything in
order to become my priceless self.
Miki just did what she had to do.
I suddenly wanted Miki to continue being here.

[Taichi]
"Let's go to the shrine. If we use a car..."

[Miki]
"It's too late."

It was that time, suddenly.
The sky darkened.

[Taichi]
"?!"

[Miki]
"It's begun."

The Miki I tried to save...
The Miki I built up...
She'd be reset.
Really.
The whole world would reset.
That was...the cut of the subjective time with Miki.
In a way, an extinction.
Miki was shaking.
Fear.
Yes.
Her fear must be much stronger than mine.
Of course she was afraid.
She pushed her face into my chest.

[Miki]
"I'm scared...could you keep holding me?"

[Taichi]
"Don't be. I'm pretty scared too."

[Miki]
"Our conversations and memories will all disappear."

She pounded on my back with her hand as she held me.

[Taichi]
"Don't think about it too much."

[Miki]
"Agggh..."

[Taichi]
"I wonder how we'll disappear."

[Miki]
"I'll be inexperienced again..."

[Taichi]
"Well yeah."

[Miki]
"What do you think Sakuraba's doing?"

[Taichi]
"He's dead already. At least, inside of me."

[Miki]
"You really say things with no love."

[Taichi]
"Don't you tell me that!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahah!"

We talked just like our everyday conversation.

[Taichi]
"Jeez, do the reset instantly, stupid world!"

[Miki]
"Hey, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"What is it, my love?"

[Miki]
"I love you."

Those were the last words I heard.
