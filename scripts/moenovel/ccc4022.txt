[Taichi]
"Owww..."

The throbbing woke me up.

[Taichi]
"What, why am I in my secret room?"

And I wasn't wearing my uniform anymore.
My wounds were cared for. And whoever did it, did
well.
Ah, Youko...she was dead...

[Miki]
"Oh, good morning!"

Miki entered the room.

[Taichi]
"You're Micchi!!"

[Miki]
"Sure, I'm Micchi. If you say so."
"Your house doesn't have any food that I had to
stole rice and miso from the neighborhood."

[Taichi]
"Ah, Mutsumi doesn't have the time to cook..."

She would only buy the necessary amount.

[Miki]
"Does it hurt?"

[Taichi]
"It does!"

I cried.

[Miki]
"Oh, don't cry, here's some medicine I use for my
cramps."

[Taichi]
"I don't need that!"

I tossed it away.

[Miki]
"No, this is a painkiller."

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're right, sorry."

[Miki]
"I cooked for you."

[Taichi]
"What is this huge star-looking thing?"

It looked kind of warped. But still looked really
beautiful in a way.

[Miki]
"It's a rice ball."

[Taichi]
"You're so untalented you somehow look like a
genius."

[Miki]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"How did your rice ball end up looking like this?"

[Miki]
"I made it like how you're supposed to make it."

[Taichi]
"This is a mysterious ball of rice."

I ate it.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, this is good."

[Miki]
"Lots of roe in it."

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

But it was really salty.
It would spread quick through an anemic body.
I quickly gobbled down three of them.
I drank the miso soup at once.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

[Miki]
"Glad you enjoyed it."

[Taichi]
"The wounds hurt, but I can do sex, Miki."

[Miki]
"At least have a little doubt."

[Taichi]
"Then..."

[Miki]
"You're going that way, huh..."

[Taichi]
"Why do you keep me alive?"

[Miki]
"Hm...it seems like you're not as crazy as before,
and..."
"I wanted to talk to you since you knew everything."

[Taichi]
"Um, before you made me blackout..."

[Miki]
"Whoa, not that!"

She shook her hands.

[Miki]
"That's because I really was going to kill you!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, but I heard it already."

[Miki]
"Uh, ughh..."

Her face blushed.

[Taichi]
"You look ashamed."

[Miki]
"Well, I do have emotions."
"I'm just apathetic towards others, hmph!"

She said 'hmph' to herself, as she turned away.

[Taichi]
"I think you're just playing with me."

[Miki]
"That's true too..."

Really.

[Taichi]
"Hey... Do you think we're the only ones left in
this world?"

[Miki]
"Sakuraba..."

[Taichi]
"He'll die out in a field, maybe he's already dead.
He'll fall over and his luggage will hit his head...
Or something."

[Miki]
"Sounds possible..."

[Taichi]
"A lot less people around."

[Miki]
"But they'll all come back next week."

[Taichi]
"If I go to the shrine, will I be able to keep my
current self?"

[Miki]
"Yes, you will. Do you want to live on as you
current self?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."
"This week's memories are really tough."
"Like, everyone's dead but we're so calm."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"My heart won't cry anymore."
"I at least hope that I could forget about that
part."

[Miki]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"If the world repeated...and I keep going crazy, I
might keep hurting people, right?"
"Friends, family, people I know and like."
"Kill them over and over, and then to live with all
those memories..."
"It would shatter my heart."
"Well, it already is, it would just be worse."
"My heart would die."

I said enough, and noticed that I was hinting
something to Miki.

[Taichi]
"Oh...sorry."

[Miki]
"It's fine."
"What you said is true."
"There were even times where I made everyone else a
sacrifice in order to escape from you going crazy."

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry about that. That was my lack of morals."
"Well, you're just taking care of your precious
self. I don't think there's anything wrong with
that."

[Miki]
"But..."

[Taichi]
"I mean, self-sacrificing is good, but something
that beautiful shouldn't always happen."
"It was a world that used to force beauty in
everything."
"For me in order to get accepted by the world, I
tried to be friendly as much as possible, but
nothing's changed after so many years."

[Miki]
"I see..."

[Taichi]
"Honestly, I feel so thankful whenever there's
someone who actually likes that part of me."

[Miki]
"Augh..."

[Taichi]
"Do you remember Yusa?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Why do you think she's gone?"

I changed the situation a bit and asked her the
question.

[Miki]
"Maybe because you did something horrible to her?"

[Taichi]
"True."
"After all, I only showed her the surface that I
made-up."
"I bet she was shocked."

[Miki]
"Seven times."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Miki]
"I've been taking advantage of Kiri, and that's how
many times she figured that out."

[Taichi]
"That's a lot."

[Miki]
"I've made lots of mistakes, that's why."

[Taichi]
"By the way, that kick you gave on Monday was
something."

[Miki]
"Eheheh!"

[Taichi]
"You get better at using your body when you keep on
doing survival alone, eh?"

[Miki]
"Yeah. And eventually, you get drunk by your own
hidden talents."

[Taichi]
"So, how was Kiri that time?"

[Miki]
"Well..."

She smirked.

[Miki]
"At first she was dumbfounded. Then..."

Her mood darkened as she spoke.

[Miki]
"Well, we get what we deserve."

[Taichi]
"Do you feel stressed by it?"

[Miki]
"Stressed...might be what I'm feeling right now."
"And at the same time, I don't really care."
"But it became a habit. Since we were working as a
pair until now, I've felt that we'd always be a
pair."
"I also thought that we'd always have the same
feelings..."

[Taichi]
"I guess we're both the same."

[Miki]
"Well, living is..."

[Taichi]
"It's hard..."

[Miki]
"Yeah..."

We both felt sad.

[Taichi]
"So what now? What do we do?"

[Miki]
"Oh, you're right."
"Either way, we'll both be at the shrine tomorrow
afternoon."

[Taichi]
"I think I want to experience and see the world
reset again."

[Miki]
"Alright. Then I will..."

She hesitated for a bit, and then got closer.
I avoided her.

[Miki]
"Ughf."

She fell flat on the bed.

[Miki]
"Hey...you!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I thought you'd eat me up!"

[Miki]
"What a mess..."
"I'm going home."

[Taichi]
"Wait, wait..."

I grabbed her wrist.

[Miki]
"Huh?"

I had her in my arms quickly.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, a bit too strong."

[Miki]
"This isn't romantic at all..."

[Taichi]
"Wild is better."

[Miki]
"It's not wild, you liar. It's false advertising."

[Taichi]
"Don't say that."

[Miki]
"Who cares about romance anyway?"

[Taichi]
"It's the way the world is."

Miki took a step towards adulthood.

[Taichi]
"Are you okay in the dark?"

[Miki]
"Of course I prefer it dark..."

It didn't matter to me either way.

[Taichi]
"I want to kiss you..."

[Miki]
"Whoaa."

[Taichi]
"Miffie, I want to kiss you."

[Miki]
"Sure, I'm Miffie, if you say so... But..."

I kissed her.
When our lips parted, Miki's lips seemed to move
into an X mark.

[Taichi]
"What's with that X mark mouth of yours?"

[Miki]
"I don't know."

[Taichi]
"Why are you so cute, you woman!"

[Miki]
"I don't know..."

[Taichi]
"Mpphm..."

Squeeze.

[Miki]
"Mpphahh!"

Petite girls were irresistible in a way.

[Taichi]
"Let me mess around with you!"

[Miki]
"You already are..."

[Taichi]
"It's okay even if you're a murderer!"

[Miki]
"I don't want to hear that from you."

Then, Miki and I messed around.
I finished up the procedure quite quickly.

[Miki]
"Y-you were so fast and skilled I almost want to
cry..."

[Taichi]
"I'm used to it."

[Miki]
"You're the worst..."

And the night passed softly.
