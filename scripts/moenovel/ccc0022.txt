I pushed the door.
There was resistance.
It was being held from the other side.
I pushed it harder.
Minor turbulence dispersed from the other side of
the door.
It was the wind.
The antenna.
It had somewhat made its form.
It looked like directivity and wavelength still
needed some adjustments.
But, I didn't have knowledge about that.
Misato didn't know specifics either, but she studied
it.
But that Misato was...not present.
All there was were tools.
Stepladder.
Books.
Sweet-roll packages flew around in the wind.
There were only traces of work left.
Did she work for 24 hours straight?
I looked up at the antenna.
A tall tower with empty surroundings.
An ideal environment to send radio waves.
There was a local radio broadcast called
community FM.
It wasn't such a low threshold that would be
done as a school activity.
But.
It was intended for good intentions by the local
volunteers when the area and Gunjo Gakuin was
coming around.
Which was related to this story.
The preparations were moving forward but became
hazy when a certain unavoidable incident occurred.
And the antenna brought in was neglected for a year.
That was the back story.
What people expected were lovely contents from
the boys and girls of Gunjo FM about hopes and
dreams.
But sorry, no such things were at Gunjo.
But it all worked out in the end.
Misato had set up SOS plans.
That was what she said one Sunday night.
After we split up to make sure if mankind had really
vanished.
The antenna was really high up but completing
and sending transmission still seemed far from
reality.
Honestly, I thought Misato got frayed.
Escaping gradually made people weaker.
And Misato was already weak to begin with.

[Misato]
"Pekke?"

I heard a voice from behind.
I turned around.

[Taichi]
"Hello, Misato."

[Misato]
"Hi there... Uhm, is anything wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Just came to see how it was going."

Misato softly smiled.

[Misato]
"Is that so."

[Taichi]
"I haven't been here for a while, but you've made
a lot of progress."

[Misato]
"I've been working on it for a while now, so..."

That's right.
Ever since Broadcasting Club collapsed.
Misato had been doing this all by herself.
Lunchtime DJ.
Announcement broadcast.
Everything.
Everyone stopped helping.
Kiri began to see me as an enemy...
Tomoki started to avoid his sister...
Miki nervously smiled at me...
Touko started to ignore me...
Boom, collapse.
Sakuraba was the only one who didn't change.
He still skipped classes, like usual.
I still hang around Misato, but...
She was the one who declined help.

[Taichi]
"That's right."

[Misato]
"At any rate, what a surprise."

[Taichi]
"Really is."

[Misato]
"People just vanished all at once."

[Taichi]
"It's quiet."

[Misato]
"Very, very quiet."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, where have you been?"

[Misato]
"I got a little hungry."

[Taichi]
"It's lunchtime. Were you able to find any food?"

[Misato]
"Ah, I went back home. I still have stocks of food
there."

[Taichi]
"Oh, you skipped school. The club president skipped
school."

[Misato]
"N-no, this doesn't count as skipping."

She stumbled.
She was the type to follow regulations.

[Taichi]
"Suspended, you're gonna get suspended."

[Misato]
"I don't wanna be suspended, it'll show up
in my career history!"

[Taichi]
"Suspended! Suspended!"

[Misato]
"No suspension please!"

We frolicked together.
For now, that was the closest we'd be.
