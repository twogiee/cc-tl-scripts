I crashed into a girl on a hill.

[Nanaca]
"Aah...oww... Watch where you're going, idiot!"

[Taichi]
"What are you talking about!
You were the one not looking!"

[Nanaca]
"I've loved you since I first crashed into you!"

She wrapped her arms around me.

[Taichi]
"Whoa! This is developing too fast!"

What a stereotypical cliche.

[Taichi]
"So, who are you?"

[Nanaca]
"Nanaca."

[Taichi]
"Nanaca...nice name."

[Nanaca]
"Thanks."
"But to find out who I am...well, you'll just have
to wait until next time."

[Taichi]
"So you're not a ghost?"

[Nanaca]
"Nope, don't think so."

[Taichi]
"But you look so ghostic."
*Ghostic = ghost-like.

[Nanaca]
"And why would you think that? I have legs
and everything."

[Taichi]
"Well, I mean...it's not like ghosts can't have
legs, right?"

[Nanaca]
"Like I said, you will just have to wait until next
time!"

She said it again.

[Taichi]
"...Fine then."

[Nanaca]
"Oh, here. This is my business card."

I took it from her.

[Taichi]
"..."

Where did she even come from?

[Nanaca]
"Heheh heh heeeeeh."

Nanaca laughed proudly, then said:
"It's okay for you to love me."
As she glanced flirtatiously at me, Marilyn Monroe
style.

[Taichi]
"Nanaca...is that really how you spell your name?"

[Nanaca]
"It's spelled like that on purpose!"

She suddenly got serious. Or angry.

[Taichi]
"..."

Err...was I in trouble?
I had a lot of skill with the ladies, I could pick
up the most subtle of clues.
And right now I felt something.
This girl was trouble.
No need to poke at her anymore.

[Taichi]
"You're super cute, by the way... Any reason you
crashed into me?"

[Nanaca]
"No real reason, really. It was exhilarating just to
hit you."

A smile quickly returned to her face.
Only someone dangerous would react like that.

[Nanaca]
"So, you really made that girl suffer just now!"

She laughed again.

[Taichi]
"You saw that?"

[Nanaca]
"A bit."
"I feel great now!"

[Taichi]
"You must really hate Youko, huh?"

[Nanaca]
"What a tramp. Yuck! Bleh."

[Taichi]
"I don't know how you two are related."

[Nanaca]
"We're not. I've never met her. Still don't like
her, though."
"That's why I'm happy this morning."

[Taichi]
"I see..."

[Nanaca]
"And that's why I didn't run you over this week!"

Run me over?
What was she talking about?

[Nanaca]
"She's a bad one, that girl."

[Taichi]
"Well, you've certainly made it clear that you
don't like her."

[Nanaca]
"Don't like her...? You're not wrong there."

[Taichi]
"Right..."

How did Nanaca know Youko anyway?

[Nanaca]
"The fact that she was your first...I..."

A cloud came over me.

[Taichi]
"First?"

[Nanaca]
"Whoops, don't want to bring up any bad memories.
Bleh, forget it."

[Taichi]
"Umm..."

[Nanaca]
"Time to refresh."

*smooch*

[Taichi]
"...!!"
"Whaa....why?!"

[Nanaca]
"What? It's no big deal."

[Taichi]
"Wow, and I thought that I was the skillful one."

[Nanaca]
"Anyway, that girl is nothing."
"Taichi...you won't be seduced by her again, right?"

[Taichi]
"I-I don't think I will..."

Really, who was this girl?
I felt no life force from her at all.
It was undetectable.

[Nanaca]
"Anyway, today I have something serious to say."

[Taichi]
*sigh*

[Nanaca]
"I want you to come to the shrine with me now."

[Taichi]
"Why? Is it a popular kidnapping site now?"

[Nanaca]
"As if!"
"No, honestly. You know the shrine, right?"

[Taichi]
"Well, yeah."

I didn't really feel like going there.
After all, that place...

[Nanaca]
"I know it's a bit scary, but I want you to come
with me."
"Because, Taichi, you don't KNOW anything,
compared to that girl."

[Taichi]
"You mean Youko?!"

[Nanaca]
"It makes me mad, but she is on point."

[Taichi]
"Well, her thought process is different from ours."
"You shouldn't give it any more thought."

[Nanaca]
"Yep, no need to."
"Anyway, please? You're gonna come to the shrine
with me, right?"

She grabbed my hands.
