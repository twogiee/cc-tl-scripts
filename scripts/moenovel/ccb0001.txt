It was the day of the broadcast club camping trip.
We first-years would move up,
and the happy third-years would move on.
New first-years would be coming in.
New faces joined to fill up the seven.
But actually, there was eight of us.
Seven or eight, either way was fine.
If I called her out... She would come.
Whenever the seven would gather...
The price paid was a steep one.
It really caused a ruckus.
For one thing, there weren't any faculty members.
This was a private club event.
A little bit of fun to keep secret from the school.
If word had got out, it would have caused quite the
scene.
But I didn't think that would be a problem.
...
Then the campout ended.
The seven of us hit the road home.
The sun went down as we walked back.
It felt like we were walking for a terribly long
time.
For hours and hours.
It was a walk that usually didn't even take an hour.
Perhaps we were just tired.
No one said anything.
The only sound was seven sets of footsteps.
The trail was oddly quiet.
Not even the sound of insects reached us.
Even the air felt oddly cold...
Although it was still summer.
Although it was dark, I could still see.
I could see the road.
I always had excellent night vision.
Just when I thought we'd taken the wrong path,
we reached the city.
Humanity had ceased to exist.
