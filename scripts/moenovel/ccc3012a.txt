I decided to chase her.
I had a bad feeling about it though.
A really bad feeling.
This way.
That feeling before...
I knew.
I knew all about it.
I found a bicycle.
No lock on it.
I borrowed it.
I went to yesterday's place.
I came to a field.
Kiri...wasn't there.
I thought she came here.
I searched around where Kiri was standing yesterday.
I found some luggage. She was here.
Guess she went somewhere.

[Taichi]
"..."

I breathed deeply.
I closed my eyes, and my eyelids pressed in on my
eyeballs.
Inside my eyes, an image floated
as if turned on by a switch.
It was no surprise.
Whenever the light suddenly changed, your eyes
automatically and slowly adapt to the darkness.
I opened them.
The night was brighter.
I could clearly see the movements in the field with
my eyes now.
Cat's eyes...
My consciousness became clearer.

[Taichi]
"I hate this... Geez."

I felt like I had become something else.
All right then.
Into the forest.
And then I felt a slight presence.

[Kiri]
"Hyaaa!"

I heard a scream.

[Taichi]
"Huh?!"

I ran.
Light filled my vision.
Memory and fear both hit me simultaneously.
Damn!
Youko's eyes showed her seriousness this time.

[Taichi]
"Stop it!"

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

She didn't look surprised.
Maybe they noticed me drawing near.

[Kiri]
"Grrr..."

Kiri moved the moment she saw an opportunity.
But Youko didn't let Kiri get out of her sight.
She spun her wrist and started spinning a belt with
a rock.
One spin.
When Youko released the other side of the belt, the
force from spinning sent the rock flying.

[Kiri]
"Ahh!"

There was nothing I could do.
When something happens so sudden, you won't
be able to cope with it even when you're conscious
about it.
The rock hit Kiri in the calf.

[Kiri]
"Ah!"

Kiri fell hard into a cowering position.
She held her leg and clenched her teeth.
It must have hurt badly.
I felt a chill on my spine.
Youko had slung a stone at her.
It was a technique shepherds used to fend away
animals.
It was a much more primitive weapon than the
crossbow in Kiri's hands.
You could say she wasn't even armed.
She wasn't armed but her power was...tremendous.
She threw a stone that was wedged inside a strap.
That was it.
Without using compressed air, explosives, or gas.
The only thing that sent the stone flying was a
spinning strap.
Like a bullet that defied air friction.
Gun barrels existed in extremes of delicate numbers.
You could trust their reliability for long, adverse
conditions.
A continued research you could use for killing over
and over.
Of course, that didn't extend to all firearms.
But what Youko used was...different.
This girl was born blessed with excellent genetics,
and the undetectable muscle strength she possessed
was more than a grown man's.
It wasn't just simple strength.
It was agility, movement, and mobility.
And in those fields, she had no handicap.
Youko Hasekura could always move quickly and quietly.
It was difficult to master the use of a sling
as an extension of the limbs.
There was no bolt set in Kiri's crossbow.
It fell off after she was hit.
The crossbow was another fearsome weapon.
But it didn't serve as a shield for Kiri.
She didn't even had the time to set the bolt before
the sling hit her.
But...
She did well to survive.
Even though it was an unexpected shot from Youko,
Kiri did well in protecting her life.

[Youko]
"..."

"Youko tucked a second stone into the belt in
her hand."
She started to swing the belt in a circle, and the
makeshift sling became a blur of motion.

[Kiri]
"W-wait..."

Kiri's face was pale.

[Kiri]
"Wh-what are you...doing?"

[Youko]
"You were going to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"?!"

[Youko]
"You were practicing how you'd kill him."

[Kiri]
"I-is that why...you're trying to kill me?"

[Youko]
"..."

She wouldn't respond to any conversation.
The look in her eyes, I had seen it before.
"What are you scared of? Do you want me to 'handle'
it for you?"
She always "handled" the things I didn't like. 
She always did.
She completely wiped it away from this world.
It wasn't just her dedication.
She favored me to the point of selfishness.

[Kiri]
"Aagghh..."

The sling continued to spin in Youko's hand.
Its sharp whistling sound cut the air.
Seeing and hearing the destructive force before her,
Kiri was frozen in fear.
This would be the instrument of her death.
Kiri looked as if she couldn't believe it.
The stone inside the sling had enough energy.
With her skill, she could release it at any spin.
But the speed seemed to fade a bit.
That meant that Kiri's leg remained without a
serious wound.
But if Youko hit her head, Kiri would die.
Was Youko certain of killing Kiri?
She kept spinning the rock in the air.
So that by the time it hits, it wouldn't just hurt.

[Kiri]
"S-stop..."

Kiri held her crossbow in front of her face
defensively, and began to weep.
Kiri was at her limit.

[Taichi]
"No more."

I stood in front of Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

The sling's spinning slowed.

[Youko]
"If I let her live, you're putting yourself in more
danger, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"That's fine with me."
"We'll all be reset anyway."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Let her do what she wants."

[Youko]
"I can't..."

[Taichi]
"Youko."

I called her name strongly.
But she showed no signs of relenting.

[Youko]
"I'll remove her."

[Taichi]
"You don't have to."

[Youko]
"Move."

[Taichi]
"I won't move."

Behind me, Kiri was catching her breath
and watching intently.
She was torn between relief at her salvation
and that salvation being by my hands.

[Youko]
"But..."

She looked completely at a loss.

[Taichi]
"I won't have you killing anyone for my sake."
"If you want to kill someone, find your own reason."

She flinched at the remark.

[Youko]
"But...I did this...for you...Taichi..."

For me.
She'd use my name to kill Kiri.
She did it without thinking that would hurt me.

[Taichi]
"You always say that. Don't use my feelings 
as an excuse."
"Even if there's trouble..."

Youko's wrist suddenly turned.

[Taichi]
"Oh!!"

Kiri's head was peeking out from behind me,
listening to the conversation.
I thrust my palm in front of her face.
In the next instant, it was hit painfully
by the stone.

[Kiri]
"Aaah?!"

[Taichi]
"Owwww..."

Youko's face was the one to turn pale this time.

[Youko]
"Ah... I'm sorry... Forgive me..."

[Taichi]
"You betrayed me."

[Youko]
"But...I... Because..."

[Taichi]
"You tried to hit her while we were talking."

I was discomforted.
She tried to hit her for real.

[Taichi]
"Again..."

Her shoulders seemed to shudder.

[Taichi]
"You say I'm important. That you love me.
That you want what's best."
"But now you've betrayed me..."
"Again."

[Youko]
"No, I wanted to...make sure you're safe..."

She looked flustered.

[Taichi]
"Stop with all that!"

Youko recoiled in fear, like a little girl
being bullied.

[Youko]
"I'm...sorry..."

Her voice seemed to disappear.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, don't kill Kiri."

[Youko]
"..."
"But, I can't let her kill you..."
"I won't let that happen."

[Taichi]
"She won't kill me without a fight."
"Kiri and I are made from different stuff."

[Youko]
"But sometimes...Taichi...you..."

[Taichi]
"Sometimes...what?"

[Youko]
"You forget to resist death."

[Taichi]
"Well, with a situation like this, yeah."

It was true, I did that sometimes.
I wasn't proud of it, but my emotions were unstable.

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'll promise you this. This week, I'll avoid
death."
"I'll protect myself. And in exchange, don't touch
Kiri."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"If you can't understand that, I don't want to see
you again."

[Youko]
"No...I don't...want that..."

She replied immediately.

[Youko]
"Okay... I won't kill..."
"But I will be watching."

[Taichi]
"Go ahead."

[Youko]
"Give me Kiri's weapon."

[Taichi]
"Do it. Hand it over."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"You got a crossbow and knives, right?"
"Hand them over. If you don't, you'll get killed."

[Kiri]
"..."

Without talking, she threw them out in front of her.
Youko picked them up.

[Youko]
"No more weapons. If you have them I'll consider
you hostile."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri didn't move away from behind my back.

[Taichi]
"And, next week too, please act peacefully."

[Youko]
"Ugh."

She sounded like she was faking it.

[Taichi]
"Please, okay?"

[Youko]
"Yeah, okay, got it."

Too lax...
Then she disappeared into the shadows.
Her presence vanished.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

[Kiri]
"..."

The tension in the air seemed to relax.
But it wasn't gone.

[Taichi]
"..."

From behind me, I could practically feel the
air of tension...
And I noticed it slowly charging with rage...

[Taichi]
"How's your leg?"

[Kiri]
"Why do you care?"

Kiri was confused and angry as to why I saved her.
Her emotions were mixed, and she was holding back
her urge to lash out.
Her stifled voice told the tale.

[Kiri]
"Why...did you...help me?"

[Taichi]
"I...don't really know why..."
"I just wanted to help, so I did... Not much of a
reason, I suppose..."

[Kiri]
"Stop screwing around."

[Taichi]
"I'm not screwing around..."
"I see. You can't stand it."
"To be saved by someone you hate..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Were you really planning to kill me?"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Yowch... Okay then."

[Kiri]
"You're too dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Dangerous?"

[Kiri]
"You toy with others for your own amusement."
"You'll never change, if we let you be like this."

Her voice began to rise suddenly.
But just as quickly, her tone dropped.

[Kiri]
"I thought it might be fun, killing someone."

The air was still around us.
That stillness was filled with hatred.
The hatred that Kiri was spewing out.

[Taichi]
"Really, you see well."

I sighed.

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"You really have the eyes to see other people."

[Kiri]
"What does that mean?"

[Taichi]
"You think I'm the most dangerous?"

[Kiri]
"Yes...but...you're not the only danger."

[Taichi]
"You mean Youko."

[Kiri]
"I didn't do anything, and she was going to kill me."
"You both are the same, that's why you both..."

We weren't the same.
I wanted to deny it, but Kiri wouldn't understand.
So I stayed quiet.

[Kiri]
"Why did you save me?"

She asked again.

[Kiri]
"You should have let me die."
"You know that I see you as the enemy.
You know that..."
"You profit nothing from helping me."

[Taichi]
"Well, that's how you form friendships
in comic books."

She got angrier.

[Kiri]
"I'm not going to be your friend!"

If you get emotional, you lose.
Even though she kept that rule, she couldn't hold
back her rage.

[Taichi]
"If I ever get in trouble..."

[Kiri]
"I'm not going to come running!"

[Taichi]
"Good answer."

[Kiri]
"Oooh..."

She bit her lip.

[Taichi]
"I remembered the reason I saved you."

[Kiri]
"What is it then?"

She asked as if she didn't care.

[Taichi]
"Because if you died, Miki would be sad."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri started weeping.

[Taichi]
"Well, maybe I should leave you here."

[Kiri]
"Stop mocking me! You always do."

[Taichi]
"It's my identity. I can't do it any other way."
"So, Kiri."

Anyway.

[Taichi]
"Would you take care of my wound?"

[Kiri]
"Why do I have to do that?"

[Taichi]
"I'm bleeding, right?"

I felt the blood dripping down my fingers.

[Taichi]
"I don't like blood."
"And this cut, came from me helping you."

[Kiri]
"Well, you were the one who decided to..."

[Taichi]
"I saved your life, so at least take care of this."

I said it clearly.

[Kiri]
"Okay..."

She said it honestly.

[Kiri]
"I don't want to owe you anything."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Kiri]
"But, I really don't have anything to help..."

She took out a handkerchief, and wiped the wound.

[Taichi]
"Owww...that hurts."

[Kiri]
"Oh...sorry."

Kiri apologized by instinct.

[Kiri]
"But...it's not..."

[Taichi]
"Owww... It's throbbing. I've lost a lot of blood."

[Kiri]
"Um...well."

[Taichi]
"Heal me tenderly."

[Kiri]
"Wh-what?!"

Square one.

[Taichi]
"If you were Miki, you'd be healing it
by licking the wound."

[Kiri]
"Lick...?"

[Taichi]
"The cut hurts... Oww... This is gonna be hard."

[Kiri]
"I...don't want...to do this..."

[Taichi]
"Hurry up, okay?"

[Kiri]
"I will..."
"Because I don't want to owe you anything."

The tip of her tongue nervously ran over the wound.

[Taichi]
"..."

It felt hot.
And slightly painful.
There was a slight tingle on the outside
of the wound.
I was standing.
And Kiri was kneeling, sucking my finger.
That Kiri was.
Water seemed to fill me.
A dark, seething water.
It was bad.
Her timid tongue seemed to turn feverish.
I felt like I was in danger.
I slid my finger into her mouth.

[Kiri]
"Mmmmnn?"

[Taichi]
"..."

Deep in.

[Kiri]
"Nnn!" *cough*

I pulled it out.

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry."

When her coughing stopped, Kiri looked down and
opened her mouth.

[Kiri]
"It's done..."

[Taichi]
"Thanks."

The blood was gone.

[Taichi]
"What Youko said...I think she really would do it."

[Kiri]
"Hm?"

She wiped her mouth as a frown came over it.

[Taichi]
"No more weapons. It's better if we don't carry them
around."
"If you do, I'm sure she really will try to kill
you."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri's shoulders trembled...
From fear.

[Taichi]
"I'm not thinking of what to do with others."
"Just as you said, I'm practically worthless, but I
don't want anyone hurt."

[Kiri]
"Are you, being honest?"

[Taichi]
"Of course."
"And besides, we have to build the antenna for
Misato because she's injured."

[Kiri]
"The antenna...for the club."

[Taichi]
"We have to send an SOS. You know, right?"

[Kiri]
"But there's nobody left..."
"There's no TV. No radio. No internet. No phones."
"Nothing goes through... Who do you think is out
there for the signal?"

It's not just that.
Even the world's prevented from moving forward.
An endless one week.
It sounded lovely to me.

[Taichi]
"Training...was boring..."
"Forcing a convenient scenario, getting all seven
members together, coaxing and lying to everyone..."
"And then before I knew it, I stopped putting in the
effort."

I couldn't help but laugh.
Kiri cast her gaze at me, with a look in her eyes
as if she were seeing something new and different.

[Taichi]
"I must have been in a really bad mood
to withdraw so suddenly."

[Kiri]
"You planned the whole camping thing out, didn't
you?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I did."

[Kiri]
"To try and hurt everyone more?"

[Taichi]
"No."
"I just wanted to reconcile with everyone."
"I want to go back to the old days."

[Kiri]
"You're lying."

[Taichi]
"No...for real."

[Kiri]
"To make everyone reconcile, you gathered them at
that training camp?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

She blinked.
Her eyes seemed to well up.

[Kiri]
"I don't want to believe you...at all."

[Taichi]
"Okay then."
"As I said, it's for the better that we unite."
"In any and every possible way. The club, the
training."
"We need to put up the antenna and try calling for
help."
"It's not bad to keep our hopes up, right?"

[Kiri]
"You...you're not a person to do great things,
though."

[Taichi]
"Yes, you are right."
"But that is that, and this is this."

It's weird to use sloppy idiomatic expressions in
which you use four pronouns to say something
profound, but oh well...

[Taichi]
"I'm not great, but it is beautiful to have good
friends."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Oh, I forgot but, how is your injury?"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I'm fine... Don't touch it!"

[Taichi]
"We won't know for sure unless I do though."

Her calf.
It was swollen.

[Taichi]
"Internal bleeding. Youko knew what she was doing."
"It'll hurt to walk, but it shouldn't be a problem."
"What else?"

[Kiri]
"My shoulders..."

[Taichi]
"Show me."

[Kiri]
"?!"
"Y-you really are a monster..."

She hugged her shoulders and backed away.

[Taichi]
"Hey, I was joking! Don't actually do it."

[Kiri]
"You always do this when...you sexually harass Miki
and the others."

[Taichi]
"Do you think that Miki really means it when she
says no?"
"She says 'no,' but then laughs and hits me, right?"

[Kiri]
"Miki does that?"

[Taichi]
"And I don't try to force it either."
"We adjust our boundaries as we connect.
That's how humans interact, am I wrong?"

[Kiri]
"You really have a funny way of describing sexual
harassment."

[Taichi]
"You just take it all so seriously."
"I'm going to touch your shoulders."

[Kiri]
"Eh? Ah!"

Even rubbing them lightly, she was in pain.

[Taichi]
"It seems I hit a sore spot..."
"How much does it hurt?"

[Kiri]
"I can't really...move my arm..."

[Taichi]
"Lift it up to your head."

She abided.

[Taichi]
"Your bones seem fine."

[Kiri]
"You're putting too much pressure on them."

[Taichi]
"No, I'm not."

[Kiri]
"Guys always say they're not strong... But even
scrawny Shima could lift a TV."

[Taichi]
"He used to be in the basketball club... Even though
he can't run, he still kept the muscles."

Ah, so she couldn't lift a CRT monitor by herself.
She was really weak.
Though the one in the club room was definitely a
large sized one.
When I touched her shoulder, she jumped.
They seemed like thin plates that could easily break.
If you arm wrestled her, she'd be last place.

[Taichi]
"Wow..."

She was like a little girl.

[Taichi]
"Be sure to put a hot pad on them."

[Kiri]
"I will, even if you didn't tell me."

I wasn't perving out.

[Taichi]
"So, shall we head back?"

I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Come on, let's go."

She reluctantly followed me.

[Kiri]
"Ow!"

[Taichi]
"So it does hurt. You want to ride piggyback?"

I made sure my 10 fingers wiggled lecherously.

[Kiri]
"Stop, go away."

She was really scared.

[Taichi]
"I was just joking."

[Kiri]
"I can go home alone."

[Taichi]
"If you do you might get attacked by Youko."

[Kiri]
"..."

She went silent.

[Taichi]
"Let's go."

Light footsteps behind.
I ignored the bicycle, and walked home.

[Taichi]
"What a nice night."

But she never spoke.
