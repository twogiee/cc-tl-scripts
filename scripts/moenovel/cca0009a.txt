[Taichi]
"Do you need any help cleaning?"

[Miki]
"You're in nice mode right now."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Miki]
"You possess two modes. Nice mode and sexual
harassment mode. Heheh."

She said, with her flat chest out. A push-up bra
couldn't save that chest.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

[Miki]
"Ah, you're blushing."

[Taichi]
"No, I'm not!"

[Miki]
"You're even irritated by it."

[Taichi]
"I've downgraded my sexual harassment mode
and added a safety mode instead."

[Miki]
"Safety?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it. We need to clean.
Hurry, we have no time!"

[Miki]
"All right."

I picked up the rag I'd tossed and approached
the dirty spot.
Blood.

[Taichi]
"Whoaaa?!"

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"B-blood!"

I couldn't see straight.
I hid my face with the rag.

[Taichi]
"H-hurry up and wipe that up!"

[Miki]
"Okay okay, just wait."

She quickly cleaned it up.

[Miki]
"There, all done."

[Taichi]
"All clean?"

[Miki]
"It's all right now."

I took the rag away from my face.

[Taichi]
"Ugh, I can't stand blood."

[Miki]
"I didn't know you could be cute like that."

[Taichi]
"Honestly, it makes me squeamish."

It made me feel sick just glancing at it.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, guess I'm dead weight to you."
"Call me a pig..."

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Just say it."

[Miki]
"Okay..."
"Don't pigs belong in the pig barn?"

[Taichi]
"Gah."

Not only did she modify it, but it hurt more
that it was in question form.

[Miki]
"Don't you think you should go to the infirmary
instead of the pig barn?"

[Taichi]
"No, I think I'm fine."

[Miki]
"Hmm."

[Taichi]
"Really, I'm fine."

[Miki]
"Let's take a nap together afterwards."

[Taichi]
"Gah..."

That suggestion was really tempting.

[Miki]
"There're two beds available too."

[Taichi]
"See you later, then."

[Miki]
"Huh?"
