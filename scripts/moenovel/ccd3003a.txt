I opened my eyes.
The sun pierced through the window.
It seemed like I had a sound sleep.
I couldn't recall a single dream.
It was seven o'clock.
Time for school.
Kiri was standing in the hallway.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Kiri]
"Taichi..."

She was on guard.
That was what Tuesdays were like.
Her eyes were full of hostility.
I looked away from her.
I wasn't going to say anything provocative.
Miki came out.

[Miki]
"Hey Taichi."
"Thanks for the meal yesterday."
"Come on, Kiri. You too."

[Kiri]
"I..."

[Miki]
"You ate too, didn't you?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah but... Yeah but..."

Discord.
Caused by pride.

[Taichi]
"It's okay. I didn't make it anyway."

[Miki]
"You didn't?"

[Taichi]
"Youko did."

[Miki]
"Oh, you're a very special person, aren't you?"

She said teasingly.

[Taichi]
"She's actually my maid."

[Miki]
"Really...?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

Well, it does fit her in a way...
Anyway, back on track.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, here, have some breakfast."

[Miki]
"Oh... Is it okay?"

[Taichi]
"Of course. I don't really like sandwiches anyway."

[Miki]
"Thanks."

[Taichi]
"It's gotta be hard only eating snacks."

[Miki]
"Yeah..."

Kiri butted in our conversation.
She expressed herself defiantly.

[Kiri]
"What's your end game, doing all this?"

[Taichi]
"My end game?"

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"I just want to talk with you..."

[Kiri]
"With me?"

[Taichi]
"There is a more suitable day to talk. I'm just
trying to get your attention for now."

[Miki]
"A suitable day?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, kind of."

I turned my back on them.

[Kiri]
"Oh..."

[Miki]
"Thanks for the food, Taichi!"

I waved my hand to the girls behind me and
walked off.
I killed time until noon.
I didn't want to make any unnecessary contact, 
so I wouldn't encounter any unknown tragedy.
After gaining this knowledge and experience, I
couldn't let myself die.
By noon, I was back at school.
The two of them should be eating lunch here...
they should be.
If they weren't I'd try again. Next week.
I will repeat it over and over again if I must.
And...

[Taichi]
"Is there any food...?"

[Miki]
"There is some..."

[Taichi]
"What about that lunch box?"

[Miki]
"Kiri made it."

[Taichi]
"Wow, I'm jealous."

[Kiri]
"There's none for you."

Straight to the point.

[Taichi]
"There seems to be a lot."

[Miki]
"Isn't there?"

Obviously, it was enough for three people.

[Kiri]
"But for some reason, there's not enough for you."

[Taichi]
"Hmph..."
"Then let's trade."

[Miki]
"Trade?"

[Taichi]
"Candy and gummy bears. Handmade."

Their attitudes suddenly changed.

[Miki]
"Handmade?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. By Youko."
"Reduced sugar, good for health and beauty.
These gummy bears are organic. No calories."

[Both]
"No calories?!"

...

[Taichi]
"Yay!"

Trade established.

[Miki]
"It tastes like what mommy makes..."

[Kiri]
"It sure does."

[Miki]
"It's milk."

[Kiri]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"It's actually a stalker's taste."

[Miki]
"Wow, this is really good."

[Kiri]
"Mmm..."

[Taichi]
"It's good... Kiri has cooking skills."

[Kiri]
"Side dishes are ready-made..."

[Taichi]
"But it's good."

[Kiri]
"And if I don't, Miki will just eat snacks."

[Miki]
"Come on..."

[Taichi]
"We're all going through rough times with food."

[Miki]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"Let's get married, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"That's impossible."

[Miki]
"Wow, not a no but she said impossible..."

[Taichi]
"I'm burning up for that challenge."

[Kiri]
"You want me to dump water on you?"

[Taichi]
"I'd rather you not."

[Miki]
"Are there any more snacks?"

[Taichi]
"There are. Biscuits and shortbread. Youko's very
good at making snacks."

[Miki]
"That's unexpected..."

[Taichi]
"It seems like they are good for rations."

[Kiri]
"You two are dating, right?"

[Taichi]
"No, we just lived together, that's it."

[Miki]
"Cohabitation."

[Kiri]
"Cohabitation."

They harmonized.

[Taichi]
"No. It's nothing like that."
"Since we both had no parents, we were taken in by
the same household and grew up together."

An efficient explanation.

[Miki]
"Is that so?"

[Kiri]
"I could've sworn it was more suspicious..."

[Miki]
"Hasekura is full of mystery."

[Taichi]
Tell me about it.
"Now, here, take this candy. Let's get in a festive
mood now."

[Miki]
"Yay! Candy!"

It put a smile on Miki's face.
Without delay Kiri took it away.

[Miki]
"Hey! Give it back!"

[Kiri]
"You can't just have snacks."

[Miki]
"You were eating them too!"

[Kiri]
"You still have to eat real food. We have to
maintain our health on our own now."

[Miki]
"Okaaay..."

[Kiri]
"What is it? Don't give me that lewd look..."

[Taichi]
"I just thought you two work well together."

[Miki]
"Since we are the Flowers."

[Taichi]
"It makes me want to release you as a duet."

[Miki]
"Not much of a chance now..."

Miki was being timid.

[Kiri]
"Eight CD sales at the most."

[Miki]
"Going platinum is a dream of dreams."

[Kiri]
"Then I'll buy two of them."

[Miki]
"I'll buy two as well."

[Kiri]
"Then ten."

[Miki]
"Yup, ten. Double digits."

They giggled.
Happily.
I was a little enriched by that.
Yutaka Shinkawa was gazing at the grove.
I approached and spoke out to him.

[Taichi]
"Something wrong?"

Shinkawa was sweating.
It wasn't a sweat from the summer heat.
He fell back.
Then a car came.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa!"

I got a hold of him before he was on the road.
I heard the car passing by right behind us.
I tried talking to Shinkawa, but he showed no
reaction.
He was shaking.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa?"

[Shinkawa]
"Um...sorry."

He came back to his senses.

[Shinkawa]
"Looking at the grove...you know...makes me feel
horribly sick... It's always been like this, but I
don't know why..."

He covered his face and seemed dizzy.
He looked up at the blue sky and gasped.
What Shinkawa saw in the grove.
That must be...
Wednesday.
At school.
A gate to prevent escape.
Instead of protecting the students, it was more like
keeping us away from the outside world.
That was the impression it gave me.
I dropped by the classroom on a whim.
As expected, Touko wasn't there.

[Taichi]
"Mm-hm..."

My heart was empty.
I pressed on the corner of my eyes.
My ears started to ring.
I shouldn't have come.
I wondered when my heart would burst.
If I failed now, it would be a battle with
probability again.
In order to come back where I was, it would probably
take more than a thousand weeks.
I probably wouldn't remember anything but...I
couldn't take the risk.
I left the classroom.
I got Touko out of my thoughts.
This was just another "ordinary" third day.
It made me feel so empty.
The pool.

[Taichi]
"..."

Good.
Just as the journals recorded.
As long as neither Kiri or Miki were deviated,
they moved as expected.
Unless, someone like Miki who lived in a set time
appeared.

[Miki]
"Hey!"

[Kiri]
"Oh no! Stop!"

[Miki]
"Ahahah! Kiri, you're going to get wet!"

[Kiri]
"We're in the water! Wait, please, my hair is going
to get wet!"

[Miki]
"Of course! We're in the pool!"

[Kiri]
"I know, but still!"

[Miki]
"Here we go!"

[Kiri]
"Waaah. My hair..."
"Revenge!"

[Miki]
"Noooo!"

What a sight.

[Kiri]
"Hey!"

[Miki]
"Whoaaa!"

[Kiri]
"Take this!"

[Miki]
"Not a chance!"

[Kiri]
"Hey! You can't use a kickboard!"

[Miki]
"It's a shield!"

[Kiri]
"That's not fair!"

[Miki]
"It is! My hair is longer so I'm allowed to use it!"

[Kiri]
"But you can't attack as well with only one hand!"

[Miki]
"Huh?!"

[Kiri]
"Time to hunt!"

[Miki]
"Oh no?!"

They sloshed around and splashed each other.
It all seemed so innocent.
My heart fluttered.

[Taichi]
"...!"

My heart skipped a beat.
The innocence moved my heart.
I felt my heart warm and open up.
I don't just mean my physical heart.
But my emotional state as well.
It made me happy.
I genuinely thought it was "heartwarming."

[Kiri]
"Waah!"

[Miki]
"Hahahahaha! You fell!"

[Kiri]
"I'm drenched..."

[Miki]
"It's a pool so you have to get wet."

[Kiri]
"So you say..."

[Miki]
"Wh-what?"

[Kiri]
"I can swim, now that I'm wet."

[Miki]
"Hey! Hey! Hey! No close combat!"

[Kiri]
"You're not swimming fast enough!"

[Miki]
"Faster. Faster."

[Kiri]
"I'm gonna dunk you!"

[Miki]
"No! My hair turns into seaweed when it's wet!"

[Kiri]
"Then I hope you like seaweed!"

[Miki]
"Wait! Wait! Hold on!"

[Kiri]
"Here we go!"

[Miki]
"Eeeek!!"

The sound of water splashing.
Endless laughter.
It was a tender reminder of the good times.
A glimpse of the gentle side of the world.
I carved it into my heart.
So it wouldn't be forgotten.
So I could remember it in detail.
Watching those two play, made time fly.
The first time I met Kiri was before Yutaka
introduced me to her.
I had heard Yutaka had a niece, but I hadn't thought
that it was Kiri.
An awkward greeting.
The denouncement from Kiri, who couldn't get used to
Gunjo.
An uncomfortable atmosphere.
I told Kiri about the students who had couldn't
adapt to society.
I told her how I felt about being treated as a
normal person.
I had talked about Kiri, and her sense of justice.
I had asked her a single question.

[Taichi]
"It's hard to make friends. But we can't live
without making any. Do you know why?"
"They're necessary, to maintain our hearts."

That didn't apply to everyone.
But to me there was nothing more genuine.
Later, Kiri became friends with Miki and the two of
them joined the broadcast club.
My mind flew again, and I remembered that time in
detail.

[Taichi]
"Oh...you came."

[Miki]
"Heeeey!"

[Kiri]
"Hey there."

The two were like flowers planted in the same bed.
The welcoming of the two is one of my happiest
memories.
We played around and fooled around.

[Misato]
"So this is our group."

That was how we were introduced.

[Miki]
"I think I get the picture."

[Kiri]
"..."

She gave me that look.

[Taichi]
"Member Miki Yamamba!"

[Miki]
"Sir, it's Yamanobe, sir!"

The first object was an autograph plate.

[Taichi]
"To you, I give you the autograph of that big star
and plastic-surgery pro, boy-loving smooth criminal
Michael--"

[Miki]
"A-an autograph plate?!"

[Taichi]
"Fan and worshiper, The Love Aristocrat Taichi
Kurosu's autograph!"

[Miki]
"Oh."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah!"
"Now, Member Kiri Sakura!"

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"To you, I give the unforgettable
Big Man of baseball, Babe Ruth..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Taichi doll!"

[Misato]
"There was no connection at all there."
"Not at all. Not in the slightest."

[Shinkawa]
"Hey guys! Did Kiri come?"

Yutaka came with a smile.

[Touko]
"Taichi! I asked you to wait! Why'd you leave me
behind?"

Touko...
There was trouble and more trouble...
Double visitors!

[Touko]
"Grrrrrah!"

[Kiri]
"It's fine, just hurry up and go home! You're
embarrassing me!"

[Shinkawa]
"I'm just worried about you! You're so helpless!"

[Kiri]
"I'm going to do just fine! Go home, I'm okay!"

[Sakuraba]
"Man, it sure is lively today."

Sakuraba muttered, standing by himself.
Smiles were everywhere...
It was like having a celebration for something.
That's how memories should be.
I was always able to clearly remember my memories.
My memory was etched with picture-like precision.
This was the only time I was grateful
for my specialty.
At any length they were great memories.
I would never want to forget it.
No...
I will never forget it.
That night.
I could hear something from outside.
I put out the candle.
And I went to the window.
I looked outside.
Kiri was walking along the road in front of my house.
I chased her.
...
A crossbow...
And clearly no toy.
It was the strongest weapon you could get in this
country.
The rate of fire was slow, but...
It was an exceedingly powerful weapon. And almost
silent as well.
Kiri pulled the trigger.
She put a bolt into a dead tree.
I only heard the sound of the wind.
Kiri took out another arrow.
She cocked and loaded the crossbow.
She took aim.

[Kiri]
"..."

Her line of fire was slanted.
Either by accident or by design.
She fired.

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri sighed and scratched her head.
She looked irritated.
She went to the tree she was aiming at.
Collected her arrow.
Then left.
I went over to the tree.

[Taichi]
"..."

Was I doing something devious?
Kiri thinks I am a monster.
A monster that devoured people's hearts.
Perhaps now, I truly was.
