The antenna was in front of me.
Mimi wasn't around though.
Maybe because of her injury.
I guess she was off club activities for the time
being.
Parts and tools were scattered around
the base of the antenna.
There was a note.
I took a look at it.

[Taichi]
"..."

Of course.
She had worked hard on this.
Build an antenna.
Send an SOS.
It was so like her. What a wonderful plan.
But, it would take forever for her to do this alone.
A red line was drawn on the diagram.
"It won't reach!"
Hahah. She was right.
Oh well.
I put up the stepladder and climbed up.

[Taichi]
"What about here?"

I guess I would see what I could do.

[Taichi]
"This should do it."
"Next up..."

I looked down at the diagram.
"I don't get this part..."
"Let's leave it for now..."
"That's not right..."
*cry*
"That doesn't seem right, I'll have to check it
later."
"The wire snapped. We'll have to find something else
to use."
*weep*
*howl*
*wail*
She cried the whole time.

[Taichi]
"Mimi..."

I looked up at the antenna.
A broadcasting station, huh?
We were yet to see if it would be effective.
The idea of everyone broadcasting together caused my
heart to race.
I guess it was just too damn wholesome.
It was so unlike us. Could this really be the thing
that brings us together? That will give us hope?
And like that...
I started club activities.
