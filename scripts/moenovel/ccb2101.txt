[Taichi]
"Yawn..."

I got up.

[Touko]
*zzz*

Touko was sleeping beside me.
Peaceful breathing.
She was sound asleep.

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

She must have snuck in during the night.
What a sinful woman.
Sexual harassment was necessary, as per the pledge.

[Taichi]
"Hm, what shall I do? Muahaha."

Since it was morning, my desires were already
sitting on medium.
It could potentially easily flare up.

[Taichi]
"Something masculine that'll stop people from
thinking I'm a virgin..."

Then, I calmed down.

[Taichi]
"..."

She looked so happy asleep.
This girl.
Touko Kirihara.
She knew that if she didn't get the attention she
wanted, she would act out...
So she protected herself with thorns.
Like a cactus.
For Touko, being alone was her way of protecting
herself, even though it was painful at the same time.
And only I could free her from that.
Giving her the chance to sleep in peace was the
least I could do for her, as she spent each day in
distress.
Just like "that time."
Familiar with those small subtleties...
I still prioritized my own selfish desires.

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry."

Instead of doing anything lewd, I stroked her head.
I couldn't do stuff like that when she was awake.
I'd get excited too easily.

[Taichi]
"We're unlucky."

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Karma pays off."

I knew I would get eventually what I deserved.
