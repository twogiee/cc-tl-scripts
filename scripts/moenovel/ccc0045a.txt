On my way home.

[Nanaca]
"Hey!"

Nanaca was at my side.
As if she suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

[Taichi]
"Oh, it's you, Nanaca..."

[Nanaca]
"How are you?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind that. The shrine..."

She hugged me.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, as long as you are having fun, it's fine."

[Taichi]
"Well, I didn't say I was."

Not that there was any context to begin with.
What was with this abrupt display of affection?
But then again...
There was a vague sense of tenderness in my heart.
Nanaca's scent.
Strangely enough, none of this excited me like
it would have had it been another girl.
The feeling of her embrace was different from
that of Youko's.

[Nanaca]
"I'm happy to hear you say those things.
Very happy."

[Taichi]
"But I didn't say anything..."

[Nanaca]
"It's not like you have to get stronger to have the
right to live."

[Taichi]
"You're not listening."

[Nanaca]
"And if you're still weak, that's fine."

[Taichi]
"Listen to me!"

I had no idea what she was talking about.

[Taichi]
"I love how your chest felt."

[Nanaca]
"You're too honest..."

[Taichi]
"I just had no idea what was going on."

[Nanaca]
"Sorry. My mistake."

[Taichi]
"How so?"

Nanaca scratched her head.

[Nanaca]
"It's something else."

[Taichi]
"Explain it in a way that I can understand."

[Nanaca]
"You worked on the antenna. How did it go?"

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Nanaca]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Where do I start? Let's start...from the
beginning."

[Nanaca]
"The beginning?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. There seems to be more to this than I
thought."

[Nanaca]
"Okay, I'll answer one question and one question
only. Any question you want."

[Taichi]
"W-what color are your panties?"

[Nanaca]
"White today. A bit cutesy. They match my bra."

[Taichi]
"Pure white, huh."

I started daydreaming about her panties.

[Nanaca]
"That's all for questions then."

[Taichi]
"Ugh, damn it all! The mystery of the world!"

That first question was out of reflex!

[Taichi]
"I'm so stupid!"

[Nanaca]
"And a creep."

[Taichi]
"Can I ask for a redo...?"

[Nanaca]
"No."

She marked a demerit on my arm.

[Nanaca]
"Next time."

[Taichi]
"Next time? I've already forgotten this conversation
by then!"

[Nanaca]
"Oh, so you noticed it already."

[Taichi]
"I did. I just noticed. I still don't know how all
this happened, or what happened to mankind."

[Nanaca]
"How all this happened, is something I can't fathom
either."

[Taichi]
"A-are you serious...?"

I tilted my head and asked sweetly.

[Nanaca]
"Serious as I can be."

She tilted her head and answered sweetly.

[Nanaca]
"Well... I can only tell you what I think."
"No matter how hard I try to figure out why,
absolutely nothing comes to mind."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Nanaca]
"What do you expect from a blossoming little flower
like me?"

[Taichi]
"This doesn't make any sense!"

[Nanaca]
"What doesn't?"

[Taichi]
"Normally, your part would be played by an
eccentric but obedient girl!"

[Nanaca]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"You're like a determined, girl-next-door type so
mold yourself into what this story demands, live
next to me, and come wake me every morning!"

I thrust my finger out at her.

[Nanaca]
"You're a fool..."

[Taichi]
"You're a miscast!"
"Not that I think it'd change anything if the shoe
was on another foot."
"I'm just saying what's on my mind."
"If you want to do something out there, then do it!
Do something no one else has every done before!"

[Nanaca]
"You can have all of those words back."

[Taichi]
"I'm a low-minded dolt who falls slave to the
antithesis of what we see on the surface!!"

I broke down and cried.

[Nanaca]
"There there, little boy. Don't cry."

[Taichi]
"Well, I'll just pray for you to tell me the same
things again next time."

[Nanaca]
"This isn't what I expected."

[Taichi]
"Oh? Really?"

[Nanaca]
"Other people consistently have the same feelings on
Sunday evenings and they typically engage in similar
actions."
"But you're pretty much different every time."
"Perhaps it's because you don't take things
seriously."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

She was probably right.
And I think I was better off with less people in my
life.
That was why I didn't really mind the current
circumstances.
Though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't the least bit
uneasy.

[Taichi]
"I don't know."

[Nanaca]
"Figures."

That was that.
I watched Nanaca try to do a wheelie on her bike.
Her memory wasn't reset...

[Taichi]
"Umm..."

[Nanaca]
"No questions."

[Taichi]
"Ngh."

[Nanaca]
"I'm keeping my word."
"Though it's not like I'm hiding anything."
"It's a bit scary..."

[Taichi]
"Scary?"

[Nanaca]
"To tell you everything."
"I feel like you'd think you've been driven into a
corner."

My cheerful expression turned fearful.

[Taichi]
"Okay..."

A promise was a promise.

[Nanaca]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

Things went south pretty quick.
I decided to lighten the mood a bit.

[Taichi]
"Umm... It's not a question, but about your
underwear..."

[Nanaca]
"Hmm? What is it?"

[Taichi]
"I wish that bra was hooked from the front."

Her eyebrows twisted in confusion.

[Nanaca]
"Really? A front hook on a little blossom like me?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Nanaca]
"May I ask why...?"

[Taichi]
"The bra would be coming off the first night,
wouldn't it?"
*First night means Taichi's first time.
"With a front hook, I can snap my finger out of your
cleavage and let those beauties burst forth into my
world."
"..."
"Though burst is a relative term here."

[Nanaca]
"Never say that again."
"It wasn't as funny as you think it was."

[Taichi]
"It's...it's only that I appreciate their hypnotic
sway!"

[Nanaca]
"Denied."

While we talked about stupid stuff...
We arrived in front of my house.

[Taichi]
"You coming...?"

[Nanaca]
"No, I'm going home."

I had a sudden thought.
Where was Nanaca's home anyway?

[Taichi]
"Okay, later."

[Nanaca]
"Taichi!"

She called out to me.
I only turned my head and kept my back
in her line of sight.
She was on top of the hill.
Very far away.
Just as if she teleported.

[Nanaca]
"Taichi!"

Though she was far, I could clearly hear her voice.

[Taichi]
"Huh? What is it?"

I lost my cool.
Nanaca, without a doubt...
She stood off the side of her bike, raised one hand
high to prop up the heavens, and smiled.

[Nanaca]
"See you next week."

She waved at me.

[Taichi]
"Uh, yeah."

I waved back.

[Taichi]
"See ya next week."

She rode her bicycle.
As she rode, she slid down the slope
and disappeared from sight.
I waited a while but never saw her
ride up the opposite slope.
