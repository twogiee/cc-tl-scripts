I found Kiri in the hallway.
Just as always.
I had better proceed efficiently.

[Taichi]
"Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Hm!"

She glared at me.

[Taichi]
"Hm!"

I glared back.
Our glares sparked the air between us!
My nipples began to itch from the tension, but I
endured.

[Miki]
"Phew, I feel so refreshed!"

It wasn't too long before Miki came out from the
restroom.

[Miki]
"Hwuhhhh?!"

Miki's scream, considering what greeted her, sharply
struck my ears.
I inched forward cautiously.

[Taichi]
"Did you think I came here unprepared?"

I reached for my shirt pocket...
To grab my secret weapon! But nah...that was just
a bluff.
I was actually scratching my itchy nipple.
I was relieving tensions in both my body and in the
room. Killed two birds with one stone.
Kiri reached for something on her back.
She somehow got hold of a crossbow and aimed
right at me.

[Taichi]
"Wh-whoa now!"

An appropriate response to such a threat.
But I mustn't be nervous...
Although it wouldn't have been a problem even if she
shot me dead...
Hmmm.
What would be the best thing to do?
