I thought Tomoki would be there, but no one was.
He must be putting energy into his "club."
If that was the case, he's probably in town.
According to the notes, this world only lasted

But I couldn't get myself to tell him that.
Because I didn't think Tomoki and Mimi's
clubs had different purposes.
