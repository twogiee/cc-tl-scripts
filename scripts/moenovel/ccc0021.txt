In the end, coming to school didn't mean there was
anything to do.
Maybe I should just go home.
But...was it okay to be this easy-going?
Past Sunday, the world would repeat itself.

[Taichi]
"..."

What was I supposed to do?
What could I have done?
I wondered what Youko thought when she first
found out.
How had she felt, leaving that note behind?
Ah, such a downer.
No matter how much you lived in this world without
people existing...
It would be redoing all over again.
Even if you worked hard, get supplies, or flee.
After a week...
You'd have to do it again.
Was there any point...
...In living so desperately?
I thought to myself.
I collapsed in the hallway.

[Taichi]
"..."

Maybe this world was my utopia.
A world where any fatal wounds weren't fatal.
Everything was reset in a week.
Even if you hurt or shared a moment with anyone.
Reset.
Got along with Touko, then with Mimi the next.
Then with Kiri.
With Miki.
And Youko if I felt like it.
And Sakuraba...
Never.
My eyes were getting numb.
I had an eye disorder.
It had no effect on my daily life, but sometimes, I
saw the world a little strange.

[Taichi]
"I wonder...why I'm not by myself."

I couldn't move for a while, my heart was exhausted.
