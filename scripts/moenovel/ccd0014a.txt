[Taichi]
"Hey, you made it!"

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I then tried poking Touko's chest.
*thump*

[Touko]
"Are you...looking for a quick death?"

[Taichi]
"I-I'm already dying..."

She swung, and before I realized it I was kissing
the ground.

[Taichi]
"I got you a present, so don't be so angry."

[Touko]
"I don't need it."

[Taichi]
"C'mon, at least look at it before you respond."
"I think you'll really like it."

[Touko]
"I told you I don't need it."

[Taichi]
"I figured I should apologize for being so 
mean to you."

[Touko]
"All you do is lie."

[Taichi]
"I need you in my life, Touko."

[Touko]
"Nothing but lies..."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I placed a ring box on her desk.

[Touko]
"...!"
"What's this?"

[Taichi]
"My feelings for you."

She looked away in apparent shyness.

[Taichi]
"I figured considering the times we live in..."

I scratched the bottom of my nose.

[Taichi]
"Won't you accept my broken heart?"

[Touko]
"But I...!"

[Taichi]
"It's all right, no need to speak. Sometimes, our
feelings can't be expressed through words."

[Touko]
"Taichi... Is this for real?"

I nodded silently.

[Touko]
"Then maybe... I should accept it..."

She gently picked up the ring box.

[Touko]
"Can I open it?"

[Taichi]
"Sure. I'll put it on you."

[Touko]
"No way, smug-ass."

[Taichi]
"Hahah."

[Touko]
"Heheh."

Then Touko slowly opened the ring box.

[Touko]
"..."
"Why is there underwear in this ring box?!"

[Taichi]
"Auuuughhh!"

Touko threw a mean punch.

[Touko]
"Aaaggghhh, you bastard!! Arrrrrghhhh!!"

She scratched her head violently.

[Taichi]
"Wait, Touko."

[Touko]
"WHAT?!"

[Taichi]
"These aren't just any ordinary undies."

I picked up the underwear.
I poked my finger through the nether region of the
panties and showed her.
There was a slit in the area that allowed for
easy access.

[Taichi]
"They're a gag gift, see?"

I bent my finger inside the slit suggestively.

[Touko]
"Heheh..."

Uh-oh.

[Touko]
"Rest in peace, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Agghh!"

She chased me around the whole school.
