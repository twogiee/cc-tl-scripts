Sakuraba was there.
Lying on the bed.
Sound asleep with his stomach out.

[Sakuraba]
*snore*

Snoring.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba?"

[Sakuraba]
"What?"

He responded normally.

[Taichi]
"Not feeling well?"

[Sakuraba]
"I ate too many curry rolls."

He was awake.
But his eyes were closed.

[Sakuraba]
"I ate four class periods worth of curry rolls."

[Taichi]
"Are you stupid?"

[Sakuraba]
"I must've gathered a lot of class credits from it."

[Taichi]
"You know there are no class credits here...don't
you?"

[Sakuraba]
"No big deal. Not worried about it."

[Taichi]
"You should."

[Sakuraba]
"I can't eat another bite."

[Taichi]
"I'm sure..."
"I have some sandwiches."

[Sakuraba]
*snore*

Sound asleep.
Was he just sleep-talking this whole time?

[Taichi]
"Friendship is..."

[Sakuraba]
"Not asking anything in return."

I gave a thumbs-up.

[Sakuraba]
*snore*

[Taichi]
"He really doesn't care about anything..."

Incredible.
