On my way home.

[Nanaca]
"Hey!"

Nanaca was at my side.
As if she suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

[Taichi]
"Oh, it's you, Nanaca..."

[Nanaca]
"How are you?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind that. The shrine..."

She hugged me.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, as long as you are having fun, it's fine."

[Taichi]
"Well, I didn't say I was."

Not that there was any context to begin with.
What was with this abrupt display of affection?
But then again...
There was a vague sense of tenderness in my heart.
Nanaca's scent.
Strangely enough, none of this excited me like
it would have had it been another girl.
The feeling of her embrace was different from
that of Youko's.

[Nanaca]
"I'm happy to hear you say those things.
Very happy."

[Taichi]
"But I didn't say anything..."

[Nanaca]
"It's not like you have to get stronger to have the
right to live."

[Taichi]
"You're not listening."

[Nanaca]
"And if you're still weak, that's fine."

[Taichi]
"Listen to me!"

I had no idea what she was talking about.

[Taichi]
"I love how your chest felt."

[Nanaca]
"You're too honest..."

[Taichi]
"I just had no idea what was going on."

[Nanaca]
"Sorry. My mistake."

[Taichi]
"How so?"

Nanaca scratched her head.

[Nanaca]
"It's something else."

[Taichi]
"Explain it in a way that I can understand."

[Nanaca]
"You worked on the antenna. How did it go?"

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Nanaca]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Where do I start? Let's start...from the
beginning."

[Nanaca]
"The beginning?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. There seems to be more to this than I
thought."

[Nanaca]
"Okay, I'll answer one question and one question
only. Any question you want."

[Taichi]
"W-what color are your panties?"

[Nanaca]
"White today. A bit cutesy. They match my bra."

[Taichi]
"Pure white, huh."

I started daydreaming about her panties.

[Nanaca]
"That's all for questions then."

[Taichi]
"Ugh, damn it all! The mystery of the world!"

That first question was out of reflex!

[Taichi]
"I'm so stupid!"

[Nanaca]
"And a creep."

[Taichi]
"Can I ask for a redo...?"

[Nanaca]
"No."

She marked a demerit on my arm.

[Nanaca]
"Next time."

[Taichi]
"Ugh, failure."

Then something came to me.
Hmm. Maybe, just maybe...this was her doing?

[Taichi]
"Nanaca... Just one more question..."

[Nanaca]
"I told you no more, didn't I?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, right..."

[Nanaca]
"Next week, okay? Do your part,
and you'll make it."

[Taichi]
"Make it to where?"

[Nanaca]
"Here."

She grinned.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

I knew she was the key to everything, but I just
couldn't understand why...

[Nanaca]
"You went to the shrine, right?"

[Taichi]
"I did."

[Nanaca]
"You didn't look inside, did you...?"

[Taichi]
"I didn't, now that you mention it."

[Nanaca]
"Have a look."

[Taichi]
"Nah, I've had enough of that place."

[Nanaca]
"Well, no rush..."

[Taichi]
"Youko sleeps there, so I think I'd better leave 
her be."

[Nanaca]
"Hmm. I think she'd like it if you visited her."

It seemed Nanaca knew about Youko's death too...

[Taichi]
"I'm too ashamed to see her."

I hadn't been able to avenge her.

[Nanaca]
"Don't be so hard on yourself."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Nanaca]
"In other words, you're saying that you're not on an
equal footing with her."
"The flip side of that is that you want her to be on
equal footing with you."

[Taichi]
"Huh... I see."

Something was not quite right here.

[Nanaca]
"If you accept peanuts along with mixed nuts, you
might as well accept the weak along with the
strong."

[Taichi]
"Hey, that's Sakuraba's line!"

So she knew my past, too.
Anything goes, I guess.

[Taichi]
"Guess I'll go if the mood strikes me."

[Nanaca]
"Got it."
"You know, I didn't think I had what it takes
for human relationships, either."
"I'm happy we feel the same."

[Taichi]
"..."

Damn it all. She was so cute...

[Nanaca]
"Good luck with club activities. I know it's hard
when you lose a friend. Don't worry. You'll be
smiling again by next week."

[Taichi]
"Whoa. Don't speak with such indiscretion."
"Two people died, you know."

[Nanaca]
"Ah, well, I'll throw it out there, I guess, but you
don't think I'm the one who killed them, do you?"

[Taichi]
"Whaaa?!"

[Nanaca]
"You were convinced I did it, weren't you?"

[Taichi]
"You seem to have a mysterious, God-like power that
would allow you to do it. But it's not like this is
a whodunit or something."

[Nanaca]
"Hmm. God-like might not be too far off the mark."

[Taichi]
"Well, here's my house."
"Don't need a g-string do you? I'll give you one."

[Nanaca]
"Nah, I'm good. I'd just throw it right away."

[Taichi]
"I see..."

[Nanaca]
"I'm going home. Bye."

I had a sudden thought.
Where was Nanaca's home anyway?

[Taichi]
"Bye bye."

Her bicycle disappeared over the hill.

[Taichi]
"..."
