I managed to gather everyone from the broadcasting
club, now nearly on the verge of collapsing, to a
camp.
It was hard work.
The broadcasting club had been growing in members.
Youko Hasekura
Misato Miyasumi
Taichi Kurosu
Hiroshi Sakuraba
Tomoki Shima
Touko Kirihara
Miki Yamanobe
Kiri Sakura
Eight members in total.
These eight people, had no relations with each other
whatsoever before this camp.
Firstly, Youko couldn't care less about other people,
so she didn't even take part in club activities.
Sakuraba was always a bit of a wanderer,
so there was no way he would regularly join in.
Shima and Mimi had a dispute so there was a cold war
going on between those two.
Touko was in a cold war with me.
Miki was a friendly girl, but she distanced herself
from the club since she was with Kiri.
To add to that, Kiri didn't like me.
In the midst of all that, I didn't attend regularly either.
Mimi took care of this and that all on her own.
I saw that occasionally.
She didn't say a thing to any of us, as we stayed
put in the club room.
Not saying anything, may have been a disguise for
another emotion she had.
Suddenly, something happened inside me.
It occurred in my heart... But I couldn't explain
exactly what it was.
Thinking back, I might have been close to my limit.
If I was able to gain some sort of happiness through
it.
I would have been able to remember this scene, for the
rest of my life.
I possessed a strong visual memory.
Anyhow.
I got stirred up and gathered everyone.
Used a little force.
I did something similar when we went to the
beach last year.
I could control them once I pulled them out.
I ventured out and took action to make summer camp
happen as it had every year.
...But it was a huge fail.
I've done it behind the faculty's back before, but...
"This is all my sister's fault, right?!"
"I'm not comfortable."
"Stop that, stop fighting..."
"Wa-wait! I didn't lie to you!"
"You lied to me!"
"This is exactly why... I didn't want to come with
everyone."
They went into a dispute.
That achieved nothing.
Everyone's relations were the same.
Rather, it just seemed to highlight all the bad parts.
The camp ended in sorrow and distress.
For several days, we didn't speak a word to each
other.
Conversation was possible, as long as they met
one-on-one.
But, the atmosphere was horrible, because of the
dysfunctional relationships.
This time, I borrowed Mimi's strength.
Which, lead to losing the trust she had for me.
I wondered what Mimi thought.
About me, and about what I did.
The seven of us hit the road home.
I didn't want to see them.
We were all exhausted and tired. We avoided eye
contact with each other.
Almost as if they were strangers.
So I walked in front.
I walked fast.
The sun went down as we walked back.
It felt like we were walking for a terribly long
time.
For hours and hours.
It was a walk that usually didn't even take an hour.
Perhaps we were just tired.
No one said anything.
The footsteps of seven people, eight including
myself, that was it. That was the only sound in the
world.
The trail was oddly quiet.
There was not even the faintest sound of insects.
Even the air felt oddly cold...
Although it was still summer.
At that moment...
The world seemed blurred.
It felt like I was viewing the same scene
from a different perspective.
I stopped for a moment.
I didn't know whether I should keep going or not.
I kept going anyway.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

I heard Misato's voice from behind.
I kept going anyway.
I ran away looking straight ahead.
If we could do it all again...
Or, if I hadn't stopped.
If I had stopped and not turned back...
I wondered if we would have been able to keep going
without making a mistake.
