My oldest memory is so faint and blurry.
A memory so fuzzy, I can barely remember it.
I was in a luxurious room, filled with an aura of
aristocracy.
There was a canopied bed and European chairs.
But still, I preferred sitting on the floor.
Especially on days like that.
Beyond the window I saw only the black, starry
curtain of night.
I was captivated by the twinkling lights contained 
in the window frame.
My reflection was trapped in the glass wall between
the outside world and my room.
A reflection of a maiden in her bower...
A graceful young girl dressed in a Western style
dress...
Who are you?

[Girl]
"Taichi..."
