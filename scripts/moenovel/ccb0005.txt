The rooftop was just beyond this door.
I was sure she would be there.
I opened the door, but with some hesitation.
I knew I was going to fail.
I was asking too much to impress Misato.
I even anticipated that it would hurt her.
I anticipated it but blocked it out of my mind.
And yet again...I was trying to use Misato.
I did this for my own peace of mind.
Which, given everything, probably seemed a bit
silly.
But humans are driven by feelings, maybe that's why
I felt like I did.
At least, that's what I thought.
But still, I wondered how she felt...
It bothered me, a little.
I turned the knob and pushed on the door.
The wind blew.
But the second I stepped out...
Something made me feel so cheerful, somehow.
Further down, I saw a large antenna, which was built
on the same foundation as the water tank.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

The antenna was unfinished.
The parts and knowledge needed were lacking.
But this girl kept at it, as she tried to finish it
little by little.
No...
I was maybe feeling a bit pessimistic.
That happened every now and then.
It was just before the trip.
And she was here all alone.
I knew that club activities were the only escape
she had left.
And I knew that was still the case now.
Misato Miyasumi.
She was standing by the antenna, embraced by the
wind.

[Taichi]
"Misato!"

As I called out to her, her fan-like hair billowed.
Her black cape swam the ultramarine skies.

[Misato]
"Pekke?"

I heard her whisper my name. Her special name for
me.
Along with the movement of those soft, red lips.
The strong winds made hearing the whisper into
something similar to a cocktail party effect. It
felt like Misato and I shared a special connection.
It was a wonderful illusion.
We approached each other.
Misato was smiling.
Naturally, I was smiling too.
Our eyes seemed to communicate on their own.
And so, I found myself wrapped in the soft placenta
of meditation and the biting truth revealed by the
elegant miracle known as Misato Miyasumi.
Then it grew deeper and deeper until it reached
the deepest depths of the Marianas.
I could see her panties.
I could see them! I could see them!
Not just a little! A lot! A lot lot!
As if it was a national pastime!
And she didn't even realize it!
It didn't get any better than this!
Peep alert! Peep alert!
The Republic of Pantyland was officially founded!
And what a country it was!
A great country!
A country for the ages!

[Misato]
"...?"
"Hmm?"
"Pekke?"
"Pekke? Is that you, Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"Uh, hello? Is something wrong?"

Ugh. My mind went off in the cosmos again.

[Taichi]
"Oh, no, nothing at all. I'm good from head to toe."

[Misato]
"But is that drool I see?"

[Taichi]
"I'm going to commit ritual suicide."

I removed my shirt.

[Misato]
"Hold on. Wait."
"Why kill yourself over a bit of drool?"

[Taichi]
"I've dishonored you."

[Misato]
"I have no idea what's going on."

That was for the best.

[Misato]
"But what are you doing here? What about your
classes?"

My classes?
I gained my composure and stared at her.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"Ah, so that's it. You're cutting class."

She raised a finger.
Man...
She was the same as ever.

[Misato]
"I guessed right, didn't I?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, well..."

I needed to regain sanity.
I slipped for a moment.
She didn't see it.
Didn't see the reality that someone was gone.
Everything else was normal.

[Misato]
"Don't expect me to pat you on the back for cutting."

[Taichi]
"..."

I remembered yesterday's farewell after the trip.
The impression I got from the words she uttered was
correct.
"I've got club activities tomorrow."
So simple.

[Misato]
"With summer vacation over and the new semester,
I can't keep going like a flat can of cola."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"Tirelessly trying your best to attend class and
participate in afterschool activities should be the
goal of every Japanese boy."

[Taichi]
"..."

Fools tried to feel good based on how others
perceived them.
But really, it was only your perception that
mattered.

[Misato]
"That said, there's not much in the way of classes
on the first day, so I'll do this much for you."

Of course.
As long as you're happy.
The me everyone wants wasn't always perfect.
The more I forced my values on others, the worse
I was.
Maybe that meant I was the defective one.
Let me help.
Let me help her escape.
She's the one who invited me to join the broadcast
club when I was so alone.

[Misato]
"Actually, I'm cutting class, too."

She stuck out her tongue a little.
I did everything in my power to control my body.
Act.

[Taichi]
*gulp*

Her eyes narrowed.
The same smile as always.

[Misato]
"Just wait a minute please."

She came down.
As her toes hit the floor, we were the same as we
were before.

[Misato]
"Hi there!"

[Taichi]
"Please listen to me!"

I took up the ultimate fighting style of Karade's
super side fist stance.
Taichi Keyword:
"Super Side Fist"
A precise strike to the side. Basic Karade attacks
covered all angles, and super fists were particularly
effective at covering every angle besides the rear.
At the same time, Karade was no ordinary fighting
style, with techniques that addressed assaults from
directly above and below as well.
While no being on Earth attacked like that,
it was better to be safe than sorry.
If such an enemy were to appear, Karade would be the
only defense, resulting in it being more important
than ever. The entire world was a metagame.
It kind of resembled a stomping sumo wrestler,
but I didn't let that bother me.

[Misato]
"Wh-what's going on?"

She took up an unusual stance of her own.

[Taichi]
"I want to make up for all of the time I spent
cutting club activities!"

[Misato]
"Seriously?!"

[Taichi]
"I swear on your school swimsuit that I, Taichi
Kurosu, will do everything, decent or indecent,
to support you and your club activities!"

[Misato]
"Just imagining that makes me dizzy!"

[Taichi]
"That's great!"

[Misato]
"You took that as a compliment?!"

[Taichi]
"That's the only way I knew how to take it!"

[Misato]
"You're so smart! That was so good that I thought
you were back to being a slobbering idiot for a
second there!"

[Taichi]
"The difference between geniuses and us is paper
thin!"

The strange poses and conversation continued.
Now this was a school club.

[Taichi]
"Well then, I can do everything from rubbing oil
on you, to chest massages, to picking strawberries.
Your wish is my command."

[Misato]
"Well..."

I got carried away and started talking dirty.
She didn't like it when I spoke like that (though
she was a bit slow on the uptake).
Much to my delight, she smiled sweetly.
Didn't she realize I was harassing her?
I told her to let me taste God's love from her angel
lips.

[Misato]
"Get lost."

[Taichi]
"My life has been on a downward spiral ever since I
bought those Chinese shares on the stock market!!"

I guess the grass always seemed greener on the other
side.
Who could've known what the Chinese were up to
anyway...

[Taichi]
"The antenna's really coming along, isn't it!"

[Misato]
"Yes. I've worked so hard!"

The conversation continued normally.
That was a testament to how strong our
relationship was.
Not even the end of the world could divide us.

[Taichi]
"Is it finished?"

[Misato]
"Not even close, really."

The vendor was supposed to have put it up.
But they ran off after delivery.

[Misato]
"I'm no expert... I'm just trying to figure it out
the best I can."
"The structure is one thing, I haven't even started
on the wiring and adjustments."

[Taichi]
"Oh, dear..."

Unfortunately, I had no idea how to do any of that.

[Taichi]
"It doesn't look like there's much I can help with,
besides being naughty, then..."

[Misato]
"Being naughty will get you suspended, you know."

*pat pat*
She patted my head.

[Taichi]
"Sooo cuuute."

My throat made a sound.

[Misato]
"There you go."

[Taichi]
"Mmm. Mmm."

[Misato]
"You keep using all of these strange words, but I'm
fine with you revealing obvious traumas stemming
from past embarrassment and jealousy."

[Taichi]
"Looks like I'm about to be more pragmatic
than ever!"

[Misato]
"That's what the masses want."

[Taichi]
"But I hate them!"

Or I did when they were still around.
I caught a glimpse of Misato's hands, all covered in
scratches.

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

I took her hand.

[Taichi]
"You're all scratched up!"

[Misato]
"Ah, yeah, I guess I am."

[Taichi]
"I'll do it myself."

[Misato]
"..."

I looked away as if in disgust.

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't it be better if we all did it together?"

[Misato]
"If we all did it, huh..."

She seemed at a loss for words.

[Taichi]
"This is a club activity after all. I'm sure it'd
feel better."

[Misato]
"But it seems like it'd be pretty hard."

[Taichi]
"It's just how you go about it. Come up with a plan
and try to put the right pieces into play."
"It's much like breaking the trilemma. The right
person at the right time has always been a crucial
element of human society."
"Theoretically speaking, using the piece you earn in
the friendliest manner possible and calmly putting
play should ensure success."
"Of course, as a chart progresses, the trouble of
its management and the maturity and position of its
managers also come into play."
"Then, we might also need to touch on
Machiavellianism a bit."
"Also, when it comes to the means of orchestrating
dramatic and uplifting emotions through open
political deception as described in Mein Kampf..."
"It's permitted by those on the receiving end who
seek delusional happiness. Consideration of that
fact leads to the creation of my Third Reich."

[Misato]
"Ugh..."

She shivered.

[Misato]
"I really think you're gonna be a pain in the neck."

Ouch.
In this age, where mindless chatter was the norm,
I was too well read for my own good and ended up
sounding like a tape recorder.
I should just be myself when I'm around her!
Which meant that I chose to deceive.

[Taichi]
"Oww, my head!"

[Misato]
"Are you okay?"

[Taichi]
"I-It hurts... Mommy!"

[Misato]
"Hey, hang in there!"

I collapsed into her chest.

[Taichi]
"Just now the strange, super-intelligent beings
known as the Omuros are using the wisdom
of the Essenes."
"To transcend the ergosphere to eat away at the
fabric of histories spanning parallel universes!"

[Misato]
"I have no idea what that means, but be a good boy,
okay?!"

[Taichi]
"Get out! Get out of me!"

[Misato]
"Get out."

She helped me.

[Taichi]
"Waaah."
"Phew... You really helped me out. Incidentally, the
cosmic spiritual crisis was also resolved."

[Misato]
"I'm just glad it was over so quickly."

[Taichi]
"Uh, well. Hahahah. The Seventh Earth is in your
debt."

[Misato]
"How strange..."

[Taichi]
"Strange is my normal."

A bit of exercise would really appeal to the normal
Taichi right now.

[Misato]
"Good job."

[Taichi]
"So, what should we do?"

[Misato]
"Hmm. Good question..."
"Could you bring me something cold to drink?"

[Taichi]
"Consider it done! Is that all?"

[Misato]
"Yeah. That's about it."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

Thinking time.

[Taichi]
"Am I in your way?"

She looked frustrated and waved her hands
frantically.

[Misato]
"That's not it. It's just... It's just that I've
been doing this by myself for so long..."
"I don't feel the need to involve others."
"..."

I stayed silent.

[Taichi]
"..."

Her club activities were her own business.
That phrase popped into my mind.

[Misato]
"I'm just doing what I like."
"Just like everyone else."

[Taichi]
"But...everyone else isn't just doing what they
like?"

[Misato]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"At least, that's what I think..."

Touko, for instance.
Was there any reason to even come to school?
Since returning from the trip, everyone was gone,
and I was detached from civilization.
There was no radio, telephone, or net access.
I couldn't use water, electricity, or gas.
And I didn't even know why.
In any case, the only fate that remained for
this powerless boy-meets-girl couple was to
go on with our ordinary lives.
We couldn't even go off to pursue adventure.
That wouldn't do.
It would be poison to the heart.
Especially as pupils of Gunjo.
As for those who hadn't sustained mental trauma
from the circumstances at hand...
Youko was the only one I could think of.
And...her, too.
Oh?
I don't know.
What I do know is...
It was someone else who looked like Youko.
Something was just not right.
That was the extent of my current understanding.
Anyhow.
The destruction of mankind wouldn't be enough
to distress Youko.

[Taichi]
"We have no choice but to live the way we lived
before."

[Misato]
"..."

She had a grave look on her face.
I forced a broad grin.

[Taichi]
"And that's why I tried coming to school!"
"Harakiri Touko came, too."

[Misato]
"Kirihara, too?"

[Taichi]
"She was just sitting in silence."

[Misato]
"I see..."

[Taichi]
"Well, I suppose Sakuraba and Tomoki will also be
back before long."
"Those two never seem far behind."

[Misato]
"I hope you're right."

I hesitated slightly and looked at her.
I knew that I was pushing my luck.
So I did my best to appear positive.
My chest hurt.

[Taichi]
"Well, let me know if you need anything, okay?"

[Misato]
"Ah, yeah, sure."
"Thanks."

The summer day was coming to a close.
I left her behind and was on my way.
I wrenched open the iron gate and entered the
school building.
I looked back and saw that she had been
watching me go.
