[Miki]
"I'll be going now."

[Taichi]
"Got it."

[Miki]
"Oh, right."

She turned around before she left.

[Miki]
"Did you know Mimi resumed club activities?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, really?"

It had to be about the antenna.
And I had to pretend like I didn't know.

[Taichi]
"Not peace-keeping activities but... Um, different
from that life maintenance thing that Tomoki is
doing?"

[Miki]
"No, the Broadcast Club's... You know, the radio
station."

[Taichi]
"Ah... That community FM station stuff?"

[Miki]
"Yup."

[Taichi]
"Wasn't it canceled because of this and that?"

[Miki]
"The antenna is all set up."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, so risky."

Even though it was already assembled.

[Miki]
"It was done totteringly with a stepladder."

[Taichi]
"Totteringly..."

[Miki]
"That's how dangerous it was."

[Taichi]
"Ah, I guess it was that much of a shock then."

[Miki]
"I would think so."

We looked each other in the face and feebly laughed.

[Miki]
"Let's all keep it up and live."

[Taichi]
"Right."

[Miki]
"We all adore our lives the most too."
"See you later then."

Miki raised her hand and left.

[Taichi]
"So, club, huh."
