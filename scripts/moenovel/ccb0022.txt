It was Sunday.
On the roof.
I had thought that everything was ready.
At least, that's what I had been thinking, when in
actual fact...
The antenna had been smashed.

[Taichi]
"..."

For a moment, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Misato had put her heart into building that antenna.
But I had to concentrate.
I tried to put aside my emotions for the time being.
In order for me to consider things rationally.
Who had done this?
There were only eight people in this world.
Only eight of us.

[Taichi]
"Misato!"

[Misato]
"..."

She was at the foot of the destroyed tower.

[Taichi]
"Misato?"

[Misato]
"Er..."

I looked back.
She had a sharp, nervous look.
I went to touch her shoulder, but my hand hung in
the air.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She seemed to force the words out.
I let out a groan...
It was almost like I could understand her feelings,
just from the tone of her voice.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi!"
"What happened here?"

[Sakuraba]
"..."

Two others approached.

[Taichi]
"I have no idea."

All three of us looked at her.

[Misato]
"Of course, this wasn't me!"

She answered in a shaking voice.

[Misato]
"Who would make this just to destroy it later?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

Some people have been known to do that...
At least...back when people existed.
No?
Would she really have destroyed it?
There was the possibility.

[Tomoki]
"Sister, did you break it yourself?"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Tomoki]
"If you finish it, you'll have to face reality."
"Maybe you wanted to go back to square one."

That's right.
That was possible too.
Especially her. She was a Gunjo student after all.

[Tomoki]
"In order to escape reality, you made a way 
for yourself."

[Misato]
"Wait a second, no matter what..."

The rooftop door opened.
We stopped talking.

[Touko]
"...?"

Touko came out onto the roof.

[Touko]
"Ick, the three morons."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"..."

Touko sensed something weird going on, and she
approached us.

[Taichi]
"Why are you here?"

[Touko]
"Youko sent me a letter and said she wanted to talk.
I came to look for her."

She looked up at the broken antenna.

[Touko]
"Is it broken?"

[Taichi]
"It was destroyed."
"By someone."

[Touko]
"Who would do such a thing?"

[Tomoki]
"It's obvious."
"It's someone here."

Touko's eyebrows furrowed.

[Touko]
"That means..."

[Taichi]
"That's right, we all need to have a hard
discussion."

[Misato]
"This is a tough situation... There's no way I could
want something like this."
"There's no way this was me."

She muttered to herself.

[Taichi]
"This antenna was originally just for the club, but
then it was going to be used to send an emergency
signal."

[Touko]
"Oh...really?"

[Taichi]
"Right...Misato?"

[Misato]
"Huh...oh, yes."

As the conversation turned to her, she seemed lost.

[Misato]
"That was the plan."

[Taichi]
"That was what she was trying to do in the club."
"It wasn't just a way to escpae reality, but a way
to send the broadcast."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"That's why I don't doubt Misato at all."

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry over it too much."

[Misato]
"Yeah."

[Touko]
"What is all this confusing crap you're talking
about?"

[Taichi]
"I was just trying to calm everyone down."

[Touko]
"No! You were trying to defend her like a lover
does!"

I shrugged.

[Taichi]
"Heh heh, Misato and I are soulful lovers."

[Sakuraba]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Misato]
"..."

No one laughed, or even reacted.

[Taichi]
"..."

My joke sucked.
Touko looked at me.

[Taichi]
(Touko!) (Touko!) (Please follow up!)

[Touko]
"Huh? What? Why were you winking at me?"

What a lame response.

[Taichi]
"Whatever!"

[Touko]
"Why do you have to get mad at me?"

[Taichi]
"Okay, then let's stop looking for the one that did
this!"
"Everyone, if we can fix this, we can send the SOS
out again!"

[Misato]
"We can't."

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

[Misato]
"The necessary equipment was burned.
We can't fix it."

[Taichi]
"Burnt..."

She pointed to the equipment at my feet.

[Misato]
"It has a smell like gasoline. The person that did
this burnt everything."

I had no words.
To go that far...

[Taichi]
"Well, there's no reason to go after the culprit
anyway."

[Misato]
"I..."
"I want to know who did this."

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

[Misato]
"I know it's not me.
And if that's the case, it has to be one of you."

Her words were like bullets.
Once they were fired, you couldn't put them back.
Once fired, they wounded.
However, Misato's words were quickly understood.

[Misato]
"One of you betrayed us."

Misato and her glasses had seemed so kind until now.
Although she had gotten angry.
I never thought she'd accuse everyone like this.

[Tomoki]
"Are you calling us traitors?!"

Tomoki cried out angrily.

[Tomoki]
"I mean, calling us traitors..."

Sakuraba moved suddenly, and Tomoki fell.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

Did he punch him?
Sakuraba punched Tomoki?

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey, hey..."

This wasn't a good development.

[Tomoki]
"Ow...why the hell..."

[Sakuraba]
"Why did you break it?"

He spoke directly to Tomoki.

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Did he say just say that?"

[Sakuraba]
"What reason did you have to break it?"

Sakuraba said seriously.

[Tomoki]
"What are you saying? I don't know anything!"

[Sakuraba]
"I saw you."
"I saw you break down the antenna."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Misato]
"Tomoki, you..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

Tomoki's mouth started to shake
uncontrollably... Then-
Suddenly, the door opened again.
It slammed loudly, breaking the silence.
It was Kiri and Miki.
And...
Kiri was armed.

[Kiri]
"Don't move!"

Everyone stopped. Like they were stitched in place.
The tip of an arrow stuck out at us from the
crossbow.

[Kiri]
"If you move, I shoot. This isn't a toy."

She was right.
It was an American-made crossbow.
It had an auto cocking mechanism.
I guess it was made so that anyone could use it.
Either way it was a strong hunting weapon.
If she used it, it would be fatal.
Maybe she got it from someone's house.
People needed their defenses.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi Kurosu! You're the one who really shouldn't
move!"
"You are the one I would care the least to kill!"

She smirked.

[Taichi]
"Hey...hey..."

[Touko]
"What the hell is all this? I don't understand!"
"You need to relax, Sakura."

Touko went to take a step, when Kiri turned the
crossbow 15 degrees to the left towards her.

[Kiri]
"Please, don't move."

[Touko]
"Wait! I have nothing to do with this!"

[Kiri]
"You do."

Kiri shouted out with a shrill voice.

[Kiri]
"We are splitting off!"

Splitting off?

[Sakuraba]
"In other words?"

[Kiri]
"The area from Kamisaka's residential area to City
Hall. That will become our territory."

[Taichi]
"Territory?"

[Kiri]
"We are taking all of the food, water, clothes, and
other things from that area."

[Touko]
"You are taking it?!"

[Kiri]
"No, not just that."
"We are also taking control of the stores and other
places on the other side of the border as well."
"We are only taking about 30\p."
"It seems like a fair amount."

[Taichi]
"Well, the amount seems fair, but why?"

Kiri looked daunted.

[Kiri]
"Because we can't trust any of you."

[Touko]
"..."

[Kiri]
"Out past Hounan, in the forest past Sakai
Bridge..."
"There's a dead body."

With her words, a shock rippled over us.

[Taichi]
"A body?"

[Kiri]
"The body of an elderly person, I couldn't confirm
anything else."

There was suspicion in her voice as she
continued.

[Kiri]
"We think that the killer is among us here."

[Taichi]
"But that's crazy!"

[Kiri]
"You're the one we're most suspicious of!"

She pointed the crossbow at me.
The arrow seemed ready to leap out at me.

[Kiri]
"You've been in trouble before. So you're the prime
suspect!"

[Sakuraba]
"Trouble?"

Trouble?
It was true.

[Kiri]
"But there is a chance it was any of you."

Next to Kiri, Miki's small face hung.
She wasn't going to speak.
She just wanted it to be over.

[Taichi]
"Okay, I completely understand what you guys are
saying."
"But we are in the same group as you, we are all
survivors, together-"

She cut off my words with her own.

[Kiri]
"I have NEVER thought of you as an ally."

The rooftop seemed to freeze with her words.

[Tomoki]
"Well, this is a great opportunity."

He said this coldly and cruelly.

[Tomoki]
"We're doomed, regardless."
"Like I could ever get along with her!"

[Taichi]
"So you destroyed the antenna?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah..."
"I couldn't stand having her get away."

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"Taking others' means of escape, while you escape
yourself."
"If you're strict to others, you have to be strict
to yourself too."

He said it indifferently.
He seemed to say it proudly.

[Tomoki]
"Split-off. Sounds good, Sakura."

[Kiri]
"I can't trust...any of you."

[Sakuraba]
"Is this really what we want...?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

It was like something that didn't exist.
Something that should have been lost.
Our friendship had been destroyed, completely blown.
A breakdown. A disconnection.
Something that had been there from the start, just
not quite visible.
We acted like friends, but served our own purpose.
Wrong.
I never dreamed of this.
I was expecting something different.
No.
It wasn't like this.
We hadn't been disconnected.
The club activities had been going well.
Where did I go wrong?
I guess I made a really big mistake.
My existence.
The school, Gunjo.
"Okay, then let's stop looking for the one that did
this!"
A convenience store like Tazaki Mart.
The possibilities of the world.
"It's all mad."
I whispered.
A world dominated by dark silhouettes.
The silhouettes were arguing.
I wanted to end it.
I wanted to end it all.
All that was left was a residue of unbearable pain.
As humans vanished, I assumed that the friction
humans create would vanish too.
So how could we explain this situation?
Eight of us.
Only eight.
Why did we still have to fight and hate?
Why?
I realized the truth.
I knew.
I had to be alone.
There couldn't be others.
Unless you were alone, humans would be humans.
Alone.
Alone.
Alone.
How do you become alone?
I felt dizzy.

[Miki]
"Kill, kill him!"

Miki screamed. I didn't care.

[Kiri]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"Hurry, kill him!"
"Kill him now!"

No one cares, kill away!
Do what you want.
Just, whatever.
In this gentle world.
Gentle world.
A world with charity for a weirdo like me.
That reality.
How was this possible?
It was obvious.
Everything moves.
Before these eyes.
In the world there is only movement or silence.
Then movement becomes silence.
That's what I was thinking.
Maybe I was moving forward without knowing.

[???]
"#####"

Someone's voice.
I couldn't hear.

[??]
"####!"

Who was it?
I turned to look.
