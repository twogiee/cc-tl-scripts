[Miki]
"Ohhh, it throbs when I move!"

[Taichi]
"Hold on. I'll get you a good doctor."

I opened the window and whistled.
Come on in, Youko!

[Taichi]
"..."

She didn't come.
I whistled again.
Come on in, Youko!

[Taichi]
"..."

Hmm...

[Miki]
"My arm is in tatters."

[Taichi]
"Eek."

Guess it was up to me.
I rolled up my sleeves.
I took a look at her wounds.

[Taichi]
"Oooh..."

The blood smelled nasty.
I clipped my nose with a clothespin.

[Miki]
"What's with that?"

[Taichi]
"Don wobby out it. (Don't worry about it)"

[Miki]
"Is it part of the treatment...?"

As long as she thought it was, then that was good
enough.
Umm... Water first...
I washed away the blood in the wash basin.
I felt relieved.

[Miki]
"..."

Miki was staring at me as if she was trying to
figure me out.
Disinfectant.

[Miki]
"Nyaahh!"

It seemed to sting.
Just a little more.

[Miki]
"Hyaahh!"

What did you expect?
Gauze.
Bandage.
Bandage fastener.
Sleeve down.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

The clothespin was no longer needed.

[Taichi]
"Operation complete."

[Miki]
"It throbs. The area around the wound feels numb."

[Taichi]
"That's what you call love."

[Miki]
"Th-this is love...?"

[Taichi]
"And true love at that. We're talking
89\p compatibility. No doubt about it."

[Miki]
"I see. So this is love..."

[Taichi]
"How does the blossoming of love feel?"

[Miki]
"I don't know. I haven't had time for love."

[Taichi]
"Ugh. You make me wanna cry."

[Miki]
"By the way, I'm sorry that you had to treat me
even though you're afraid of blood."

[Taichi]
"Huh? We've got no doctor, and the wound was
serious. Do love yourself more, though."

[Miki]
"I do... I really do..."

[Taichi]
"No worries then."

[Miki]
"I need to return the favor somehow."

[Taichi]
"Maybe you could give me your panties?"

[Miki]
"Woah, a steep price to pay..."

[Taichi]
"I'm kidding. Kiri would kill me."

[Miki]
"Anything else you want?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm. Well, I already had your first kiss."

[Miki]
"Y-yeah..."

Miki was taken aback.

[Taichi]
"Treasure that precious memory."

[Miki]
"It wasn't pleasant, but I'll treasure it for the
rest of my life."
"Anything less...erotic?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm... A date...?"

That's it!

[Taichi]
"A double date."

[Miki]
"Oh? With who?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, you and Kiri...and me."

[Miki]
"That would be girl's date!"

[Taichi]
"Then, have me all to yourselves."

[Miki]
"If that's all you want..."

[Taichi]
"It's okay?"

[Miki]
"Sure. Why not?"

A beauty on each arm.

[Miki]
"I wasn't sure I could do it alone, but it should be
fine with Kiri around."

[Taichi]
"You're being too vigilant about this."

[Miki]
"Certainly am!"
"I have to be with dangerous people like you
around..."

[Taichi]
"Hahahahahah."

But Miki had no idea.
How dangerous I really was.
Impulse.
Sometimes, they stir me up.
I was locked in a constant struggle with them.

[Taichi]
"Well, I've been in your debt for a while now."

[Miki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"You really helped me on Monday. Thanks for that."

[Miki]
"Oh that? It was nothing..."

[Taichi]
"I was really impressed with how you saved Kiri. I
didn't know you had it in you."
"Seriously..."

She was quicker than I remembered.
Maybe she was always on top of things.
She had dragged me all the way home, hadn't she?
Was she strong enough to do that?

[Taichi]
"Your kicks were sharp too... Which reminds me..."

I thought things through.
Something was bothering me.

[Miki]
"Umm..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
*kiss*

On the cheek.
She was the first besides Youko to kiss me.

[Miki]
"Consider it a down payment."

[Taichi]
"I-I'll give you your change so let's do it!"

I lunged at Miki.
