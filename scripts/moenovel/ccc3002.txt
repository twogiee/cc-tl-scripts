Kiri blushed.

[Taichi]
"What's next, huh?"

[Miki]
"It's obvious."
"I told you I want you to reveal everything."

[Taichi]
"..."
"Are you okay with that?"

I asked her seriously.

[Taichi]
"Do you have any idea what it would mean to
reveal everything?"

[Miki]
"Still resorting to threats?"

[Taichi]
"Fool. You should be far more scared than you are."
"You know this isn't something that can be
controlled as easily as that crossbow, don't you?"
"It's obscene blasphemy to a profane degree..."
"Once released, the light of virginity will fade
from the world."

[Miki]
"Stop your muttering..."

[Kiri]
"Uh, hey... I also don't really want to see it."

[Miki]
"Shut up, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Uh, okay..."

Misery.
Miki was dead serious.

[Taichi]
"Are you planning to send me back to having
nothing?"

[Miki]
"What if I said I was?"

[Taichi]
"Acting like this... And you call yourself a
scientist?!"

[Miki]
"Science means to investigate thoroughly. Science
means to proceed ahead even with the taboo."

[Kiri]
"I cannot wrap my head around any of this."

[Miki]
"Science is meaningless when you're afraid of
what lies ahead, professor."

[Taichi]
"Ugh, so you sold your soul to the devil."

[Miki]
"Yes. Just like Einstein did."

[Taichi]
"Give it a rest."

I touched my nipples.

[Taichi]
"Am I going to have to resort to the explosive
switch?"

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri put the crossbow down and entered the
restroom.

[Miki]
"Explosive switch?"

[Taichi]
"That's right. I can't just let this demon roam the
world freely."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Let there be serenity in every lady. Wife, child,
I'm sorry... Forgive this foolish father!"
"Huh...?"
"What's going on here? The equipment doesn't work?"

[Miki]
"Heheh. I've been reading you like a book
for ages, your Majesty!"

[Kiri]
"So the cast has changed..."

Having returned from the restroom, Kiri picked up
the crossbow again.

[Taichi]
"The wiring... Ugh! Damn it all!"

[Miki]
"Looks like your back is against the wall."

[Taichi]
"Huh..."
"Did you forget that nipples are a pair?!"

[Miki]
"Hn?!"

[Taichi]
"Your obsession with science came at the neglect
of ergonomics! You've been had, Miki!"

[Miki]
"As if!"

Miki lunged at Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Umm. What?"

A small danger signal lit up her forehead.
Kiri quickly moved out of the way.
An arrow flew.

[Taichi]
"Ngh!"

Just because you could see it didn't mean you
could react.
It grazed the side of my cheek.

[Taichi]
"..."

I turned around and saw it sticking out of the
hallway wall.

[Taichi]
"..."
"Hnnggggg..."

[Miki]
"Sorry, professor."

[Taichi]
"I'm not a professor! And that was close!
Too close!"

[Miki]
"Heheheh..."

[Taichi]
"This is no laughing matter!"

Whoa. That cold sweat hit me late.

[Taichi]
"I-I thought I was a goner..."

[Miki]
"Sorry..."

[Taichi]
"It's okay. As long as I'm alive..."
"Uh, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"Oh, uh, what?"

She looked bewildered.

[Taichi]
"Aren't you going to apologize?"

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Don't pretend that you didn't try to kill me
just now."

[Kiri]
"Well..."

[Taichi]
"Well what?"

[Kiri]
"..."

I could see how conflicted she was.

[Taichi]
"You're sorry, right?"

[Kiri]
"Unh..."

Her eyes welled up with tears.
Was it really that hard?

[Taichi]
"You're not going to say it?"

[Kiri]
"So...rr...rrrr..."

She looked like she was struggling to squeeze the
word out.
I desperately wanted to force a reset.

[Taichi]
"Never mind. I'll just force it out of you."

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Hiyaaaah!"

Open sesame!
I heard the word in my head.

[Kiri]
"???"
"Wait, what? Whaaat?"

[Taichi]
"See what I did there?!"
"The ultimate art of skirt lifting!
The Parachute Death Sentence!"
"Access the skirt, pinch the cloth, and apply force
to all 24 joints. This causes sudden turbulence
in a girl's no-fly zone."
"The result is that the lifted skirt takes the shape
of a parachute, exposing the panties for a longer
duration than your average skirt lift would allow."

[Miki]
"You aren't really human, are you?"

[Taichi]
"However, if exposure last for too long,
it can lead to embarrassment overload
and a death sentence for the instigator!"
"Parachute Death Sentence! A bold sacrifice indeed!"

[Miki]
"Guess even creeps have it tough, huh."

[Kiri]
"Why won't it come down? Why? Why?"

Kiri struggled to push her skirt back down.
But with each push on one side, the other side flew
higher.
That said, even if she let it be, it would still
float up like a jellyfish.
It was as if wind was blowing up from below.

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, if you don't do anything I'll be able to
see everything."

[Kiri]
"Oh... Oh no... It's lifting... Ahhh! Why?!"

[Taichi]
"Heheheh. Need another hand with that?"

[Kiri]
"D-don't look at me!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, oh? Can't say you're not trying. Seems like I
can see something, but can't at the same time."

[Kiri]
"It won't stop! It just keeps floating!
What's going on?!"

[Miki]
"What a remarkable skill."

[Taichi]
"You're so adorable, Kiri."

I gave a thumbs-up.

[Kiri]
"Aaaaahhhhh..."

Kiri worked feverishly.
She might have died in agony had I done this in
public.
Gotta love that technique.
It wouldn't work on someone like Youko.
But nothing caused panic like a skirt lift.
That said...

[Taichi]
"You're really keeping your guard up.
So why do you still seem so desperate?"

[Miki]
"You should experience it for yourself."

[Taichi]
"Impossible. I like showing people my underwear."

[Miki]
"Eww..."

The skirt finally started to float back down.

[Kiri]
"Huff huff..."

She was sweating profusely.

[Taichi]
"Parachute Death Sentence takes a mere
0.05 seconds to perform. Allow me to show
it to you one more time..."

I pinched Kiri's skirt.

[Kiri]
"Noooooo!!"

[Miki]
"Her fancy footwork finally shows up!"

[Taichi]
"Uuuuuunf!!"

She changed the trajectory of her axe kick.
The kick caused turbulence of its own.

[Taichi]
"Arrrrrgggghhhhh."

[Kiri]
"You've got some disorder!"

I was treated like a deviant.

[Taichi]
"Owww..."
"Anyway, you defended that well. Almost too well..."

But seriously, why couldn't I see anything?
That never happened with this technique.
Maybe I unconsciously held back?

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki!"

She was huffing mad.

[Taichi]
"Ah, they're gone..."

[Miki]
"I respect your fighting spirit."

[Taichi]
"Hmm. Well, nobody knows when they'll die."
"Live as long as you can."

[Miki]
"I will."
"Having said that... You two don't get along, do
you?"

We both mustered up a bitter smile.

[Taichi]
"It's because we're both competing for your love."

[Miki]
"I see. Looks like she's putting up quite a fight."

[Taichi]
"..."

Not even a hint of hesitation in her voice.

[Kiri]
"Miki!"

[Miki]
"Okay, okay. Well, see you around."

I bitterly acknowledged her farewell.
Miki ran to catch up with Kiri.
