[Taichi]
"Need any help cleaning?"

Miki gave a big smile.

[Miki]
"Not from you."

[Taichi]
"Waaaaaaaaah."

She rejected me.
Cruel, no mercy, not a sign of sympathy.

[Miki]
"You're not good with blood, right?"

[Taichi]
"Huh, I mean yeah, but."

How did she know that?
A wicked suspicion presented itself.
I traveled to hell and back in 0.5 seconds.
Miki.
My precious...precious flower.

[Miki]
"Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"That's right, I'm not good with blood."

[Miki]
"It's not blood, but there's paint everywhere,
you see."
"So it's a lot of trouble cleaning, you see."
"And if I crouch with this short skirt it reveals my
panties, then I have to deal with an aroused Taichi
while cleaning and that's troublesome too, you see."

[Taichi]
"I see, I see."

She had a rather direct manner of speaking.
I liked it.

[Taichi]
"That is a lot of trouble, I see."

[Miki]
"You've been infected."

[Taichi]
"A-hem. That does seem like a lot of trouble."

[Miki]
"Sir!"

She saluted.

[Taichi]
"Are you chewing your food thoroughly?"

[Miki]
"Sir, I am, sir!"

[Taichi]
"Then as an adult, I will step away. I will indirectly
support my pupil by watching over you secretly."

[Miki]
"Sir, it's an honor, sir!"
