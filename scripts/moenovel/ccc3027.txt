Five minutes of silence have passed.
Kiri didn't even shed a tear.
It is said that tears are for releasing stress from
the body.
But Kiri couldn't cry.
A deep despair had come over her.
The despair was built up deep inside her heart...
I waited kindly.
And remained by her side.
For a long time.

[Kiri]
"Why..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"Why...didn't you say anything?"

[Taichi]
"To you?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"Because you loved him, Kiri."
"You truly did."
"It was pure and fleeting..."
"But instead of expressing it to him, the feeling
was left to rust."
"You just let it go to waste."

[Kiri]
"...?"

Kiri didn't understand what I was telling her.
But that was understandable.

[Taichi]
"You are direct but fragile at the same time."
"That's what I like about you."
"Do you understand? Kiri, I love you."

[Kiri]
"Taichi...you? You're lying..."

[Taichi]
"I've only been telling you the truth so far."

[Kiri]
"But...that's not right... You resented Yutaka... So
why me?"

[Taichi]
"I never resented him."

[Kiri]
"Huh..?"

[Taichi]
"Anyways Kiri, you've been treating me as a
murderer all this time...right?"

Her expression darkened.

[Kiri]
"I...couldn't help that..."
"No one told me what was really going on... All I
had was my own guess."
"And... I still can't believe it. Yutaka did such a
thing..."

[Taichi]
"You can't expect everyone to know everything and
tell you everything."

I spoke to her like a teacher.

[Taichi]
"Thanks to you I've been hated and kicked around."

[Kiri]
"..."

There was a long silence.
I can tell that Kiri was trying to get herself
mentally stable.
Her decision was made.

[Kiri]
"What should I...?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm?"

[Kiri]
"What should...I do?"

[Taichi]
"What do you want to do?"

[Kiri]
"Because...I, WE have been so unfair to you..."

We, huh...
She took responsibility for Yutaka's actions.

[Taichi]
"Well..."

What to do...

[Kiri]
"If I apologize, would you forgive me?"

[Taichi]
"There's no need to apologize."
"Well then..."
"Will you do whatever I say...?"

[Kiri]
"..."

She nodded her head.
I placed my hand on her head.
With that hand, I stroked the side of her face, and
ran a finger along the inside of her ear.

[Kiri]
"Hng..."

The world only had a day left anyway.
Might as well go out with a bang.
It no longer mattered what kind of person I would be.

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Kiri]
"If that's...what it takes for your forgiveness."

[Taichi]
"You're not going to be like a genie in a lamp and
say only up to three wishes, are you?"

[Kiri]
"No..."
"I will do...whatever you tell me..."

She had become so timid.

[Taichi]
"You know I'm weird, so I'll probably ask you to
give me your used school uniform. Are you okay with
that?"

[Kiri]
"Y-yes... Whatever you like."

Wow.
Too cute.

[Kiri]
"If that's...what you want..."

She had tears in her eyes but...

[Kiri]
"I under...stand..."

She was now my love slave.
I was surprised I can actually get one.

[Taichi]
"Not bad staying alive."

But I only had one more day.

[Taichi]
"Yikes..."

I had to hurry.
And so I impatiently moved on to the next step.

[Taichi]
"S-so, maybe I should demand something more
naughty?"

Kiri began to tremble, obviously startled.

[Kiri]
"How...naughty?"

[Taichi]
"Um..."
"Maybe some...meat on meat action?"

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, I just wanted to know to what level was
acceptable for you."

It was pretty heavy-handed.

[Kiri]
"Are you going to...sleep...with me?"

[Taichi]
"I-I haven't decided yet."

I had definitely decided to sleep with her.
But it was difficult to say.

[Taichi]
"Well, just stand there for now."

[Kiri]
"R-right now?"

There was no time.
I had to get a super-filthy scene going ASAP.
I made her stand on the teacher's platform.

[Taichi]
"All right, let's do something nasty."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri was lost for words.
Her whole face turned red from the bashfulness.
She seemed anxious about whatever kind
of lewd experience I was going to force out of her.
I was anxious as well.
To be given the permission to do anything you wanted
to a single person, the pressure was immense.
I had gone into full timid-mode.
All the vigor and determination I had before only
lasts for a short period of time!

[Taichi]
"A-all right Kiri..."

Even my tough talk was shabby at best.

[Taichi]
"Ummm... It's time for confessions now."

[Kiri]
"Confessions?"

[Taichi]
"I'll ask you some questions,
and you'll answer them honestly, got it?"

[Kiri]
"Y-yes."

[Taichi]
"Um... Um..."

My mind had gone blank.

[Taichi]
"Errr, uhhh..."

I was completely empty-headed.

[Taichi]
"I-it can't be..."

A veteran like me...
How could I have suddenly become such a rookie?

[Kiri]
"Um...?"

I have to put her to shame somehow!

[Taichi]
"When did you hit puberty?!"

[Kiri]
"W-what?"

What the hell kind of question was that?!

[Kiri]
"I think it was between 11 and 13..."

Even though Kiri was confused, she still answered.

[Taichi]
"I see."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

The conversation died...
I had to overreact to make her embarrassed!

[Taichi]
"At 13?! That's pretty early!"

[Kiri]
"Eh... Is it, really?"

[Taichi]
"To have those luscious D-cups... W-wait, you don't
think so? At 13?"

I had become so meek.

[Kiri]
"I don't know... It's not something you tell to
people..."
"And... I'm not really a D-cup..."

[Taichi]
"Hmmmm."

Time to change the question.
Something that would embarrass girls.
No good, I drew blanks again.
Why?
Was I really so weak?

[Taichi]
"Uh, um... When you bathe, what do you wash first?"

[Kiri]
"M-my stomach..."

[Taichi]
"Oh, I see."

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

C'mon, I had to ask more.

[Taichi]
"What type of shampoo do you use?"

[Kiri]
"A low-pH type..."

[Taichi]
"Me too."

[Kiri]
"The conditioner is the same brand, too."

[Taichi]
"Me too!!"
"No, these aren't the kind of questions I want to
ask..."
"Ummm, are you on a balanced diet?"

[Kiri]
"When I was with my family... But recently I don't
think I have been..."

[Taichi]
"That's no good. Here, take these supplements."

I presented her a handful of vitamin supplements.

[Kiri]
"Th-thanks..."

[Taichi]
"You can't live off of MREs, you need veggies too.
Health management is one's own duty. Take care of
yourself, okay? Is there anything else I can do?"

[Kiri]
"Uh, no... I'll do my best..."

[Taichi]
"Good, let me know if you're ever in trouble..."
"What am I doing, being so sweet right now?!"

[Kiri]
"Taichi...?"

[Taichi]
"Gah!"

[Kiri]
"Aaah?!"

[Taichi]
"Shit, I don't even know what I wanna do right now!"

[Kiri]
"Eh? Huh? Wha?"

[Taichi]
"Your shoulders are so narrow! When I hug them, It
feels so nice!"

[Kiri]
"C-come again?"

I rubbed my cheek against hers like what I would do
to a cat.

[Kiri]
"Ahh..."

[Taichi]
"Marry me!"

[Kiri]
"Huh?!"

[Taichi]
"Be my idol!"

[Kiri]
"P-please get a hold of yourself...uh...I...I can't
breathe."

[Taichi]
"Ahh, sorry sorry."

I let her go.
I stared longingly at Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"You're an innocent yet unstable girl and I wanna
smother you with my love and do crazy things to you
but I also want to take care of you."

[Kiri]
"I-I don't really know what you mean, but..."
"P-please have me however you like..."

[Taichi]
"Ohhhhh..."

I could feel my inside swelling up massive energy.
I felt like I would burst at any moment!

[Taichi]
"No more pre-game shows. Time for the main event.
Your shyness and my instinct, let's see which one is
the real deal."

[Kiri]
"???"

Hmph. I had no idea what I was saying either.
Nevertheless, it's show time!

[Taichi]
"I wanna see...what color your p-panties are..."

[Kiri]
"Th-that's..."

[Taichi]
"All right, time to find out!"

Here. I. Come.

[Kiri]
"Do you want to lift my skirt?"

[Taichi]
"No, you do it Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"C'mon, show them to me."

[Kiri]
"I show them...?"

[Taichi]
"Hurry up, we don't have time!"

Kiri held down her skirt in hesitation for a moment,
but made the final decision.
She slowly lifted up her skirt, like a heavy curtain
being drawn before a grand performance.

[Taichi]
"Oh, those panties..."

After much suffering, the great joy had finally come.

[Kiri]
"A-are you satisfied?"

[Taichi]
"What are you talking about?! We barely started!"

[Kiri]
"P-please let me put it down...
It's so embarrassing...I could die."

[Taichi]
"It's a long road ahead before we reach the end.
Keep it up like that."

[Kiri]
"Th-this is...so awkward."

[Taichi]
"Th-they're great panties..."

[Kiri]
"Uh...thanks?"

[Taichi]
"They look great on you Kiri. It really matches your
clean and youthful nature."
"It matches your supple legs and the way it gently
embraces your round buttocks, shows freshness to the
people... This is a work of art."

[Kiri]
"Please don't critique..."

[Taichi]
"All right, you can lower it now."

With a look of relief, Kiri let go of her skirt.

[Taichi]
"Damn..."

Next...

[Taichi]
"Come here, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Y-yes."

I held her close.

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

And I kissed her.

[Kiri]
"Eh...mmmm?"

*smooch smooch smooch smooch*
I released my lips from hers.
Kiri let out a long sigh.

[Taichi]
"I guess you don't mind kisses."

I was starting to understand her.

[Kiri]
"Taichi...?"

The strength had been sapped from Kiri's arms.

[Taichi]
"I guess what I'm doing really is..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi..."

I went for the second kiss to seal her trembling voice.
We slowly sank to the floor together.
...
30 minutes passed.

[Kiri]
*whimper whimper*

We sat together idly on the floor.
Kiri was weeping in anguish.
I was battling with a deep feeling of guilt.

[Kiri]
*sniff* *sob*

[Taichi]
"C'mon... It was exciting, right?"

Sorry it happened off-screen.

[Kiri]
*sob* *whimper*

[Taichi]
"Stop crying so much..."

[Kiri]
"It's not that..."

She hoarsely spoke the words between her sobs.

[Taichi]
"No...?"

As she turned to face me I saw her face covered in
tears.

[Kiri]
"Did Yutaka...really have to...die?"

[Taichi]
"..."

Oh.
That...

[Kiri]
"Because of what he did... The only choice
was...death..."

[Taichi]
"I..."

About Yutaka...

[Kiri]
"Taichi."

Kiri came towards me for a kiss.
I happily obliged.
With playfulness, with love.
...and to give up.
And like that.
Kiri had become mine.
