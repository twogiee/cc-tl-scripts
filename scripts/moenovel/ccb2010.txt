I had fun going to school.
However.
Touko seemed sullen.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"Hmph..."

She had her barrier up.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

She was like that the whole morning.
I was passed out all yesterday, so I had no idea
why.
What could have happened was, that I passed out
and then sleepwalked around and 'did' something.

[Taichi]
"Uhh."

It was possible.
She was already awkward and in a bad mood
when she got up.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"..."

No chance.
Touko just went straight ahead alone.
I chased her.
Lined up next to her.
She had a stuck-up temperament,
and pretended to ignore me.
In a way it was beautiful,
even though I didn't know the cause.

[Taichi]
"Yawn..."

I spread out my arms in a yawn.
*Squish*
Then I seemingly accidentally grabbed her chest.

[Touko]
"Eeek?!"

[Taichi]
"Girl, you've got no boobs!"

[Touko]
"Shut up!"

[Taichi]
"Princess!"

I was slowly spinning along a ridge line, but as
soon as my head hit the ground...
A sudden brake occurred, causing me to spin like a
wheel on an axel. With the force of a boomerang, I
went into the forest.

[Taichi]
"Harakiri Fist...an invincible attack."

Her grandfather (now passed), who taught her
Martial Arts and Iai, was known as the Invincible
Demon God.
He was so well-known, there was a video on the
Internet of him killing a bull with his bare fist.

[Touko]
"Grrrrrr..."

And this, was his granddaughter.
No way she'd be weak.

[Taichi]
"Miss Touko...why you angry?"

[Touko]
"Hmph...idiot!"

Ah, she seemed okay again.
Still, I had no idea why she was mad.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, there's no reason to attack people
just because it's your time of the month."

[Touko]
"I don't want to hear nasty crap from you today!"

[Taichi]
"Well, if my data is right, your menstruation should
be next week..."

*Whamp!*

[Taichi]
"Ugggh..."

She hit me.

[Touko]
"Why do you know that much about me? Die already!"

[Taichi]
"I don't think you could kill me..."

[Touko]
"You don't know!"

I don't know...

[Taichi]
"You decided to live with me and you're already in a
bad mood. I guess I really don't know."

Touko's face turned completely red.
Not with shame, but with anger.

[Touko]
"Why don't you ask your own heart?"

She turned her back on me.
Then started to walk ahead of me.
My own heart?
You mean, the thing under my flat chest?
No, not that heart.
I asked my own heart.
Why did Touko suddenly get angry?
She was all smiles when she moved in with me
yesterday.
But then, she decided to burn a portion of my soul...
*swoon*
I got dizzy just thinking about it.
I still couldn't believe it.
I felt the sadness of losing a child.
I couldn't enjoy those 'reading materials' anymore.
So many of my idols were still piled up in my mind.

[Taichi]
"Goodbye..."

I put it aside and thought about Touko.
It was true that I was so shocked I fainted
yesterday.
I missed dinner.
And breakfast.
I was starving.
Oh.

[Taichi]
"That's it."

There was an ulterior motive for her doing that.
If so, I could get her on the good side pretty
easily.
As long as I knew... I could enjoy anger even more.

[Taichi]
*hum hum hum*

I followed her while I hummed a tune.
The gate was totally open.
Almost like it was opened for us.
I used to think of the school as a prison.
But now, it was kind of like a peaceful womb.
No one there.
No one anywhere.
Just a school, just Gunjo Gakuin, a place to gather.
It used to be a place people were drawn to.
Now, all the people being gone, it sucked.
Everyone finished off...almost everyone.
It was great for me, but for them, it was a
disappointing, slow death.
And so, Toukou had to come live with me.
Such irony.
I arrived at the cafeteria.
Someone was there.

[Taichi]
"Who's there?"

There was no answer.
I approached where the small sound came from.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

It was Sakuraba.
He was sitting on the floor, his shoulders shaking a
bit.
It looked like he was eating something...
He looked intense.

[Taichi]
"Hn?"

I stood behind him.

[Taichi]
"Rubber?"

When I called him...

[Sakuraba]
"Taichiiiii!"

[Taichi]
"Blehhh!!!"

I had already kicked him.
Straight kick.
My foot went into his face.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

Sakuraba was down, and said nothing.
He got up quick, no damage.

[Sakuraba]
"Why did you do that?"

He said it coolly.

[Taichi]
"It's to wipe that weird look off your face."

[Sakuraba]
"Heh, you really snack up on me."

I can't believe he messed up such an easy idiom.
What an idiot.

[Taichi]
"Were you eating?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, see?"

[Taichi]
"Curry roll..."

Sakuraba loved them.
Looked like a leftover from school food.

[Sakuraba]
"There was a whole case of leftovers here."
"No one was eating them, so I took it."

[Taichi]
"Because they're nasty."

[Sakuraba]
"Heh."

[Taichi]
"Stop laughing like that, it pisses me off."

[Sakuraba]
"They'll go bad anyway."

He wasn't listening.
There were empty wrappers all around Sakuraba.

[Sakuraba]
"Want some?"

[Taichi]
"Nah."

[Sakuraba]
"I see."
"I'll never force what I think is right on you."

[Taichi]
"Thanks."

Sakuraba didn't care about what was being said.

[Sakuraba]
"No need to thank me."

He smirked.
Then he bit into the roll.

[Taichi]
"You eat this much in the morning..."

[Sakuraba]
"You know, this might be the last curry roll of my
life."

Sakuraba scarfed it down.
Or maybe he was battling with the roll.
However.
Even I never thought of school food.

[Taichi]
"Is there other bread?"

[Sakuraba]
"There was."

[Taichi]
"That's past tense."

I guess he ate it all.

[Sakuraba]
"I didn't want anything other than curry rolls, so I
tossed them."

I kicked him.
I wanted to kill him.

[Sakuraba]
"Heh."

I kicked his head and he rolled like a baseball bat.

[Taichi]
"Why are you always like that?"

[Sakuraba]
"No need to thank me."

As he calmly stood up and said.

[Taichi]
"Are you an idiot?!"
"Where did you throw them away?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Forgot."

I punched him, straight into the face.

[Taichi]
"...In a crisis situation, it's great to have a
friend like you."

[Sakuraba]
"Don't mention it."

A criminal mistake.
And I looked better in the situation.

[Taichi]
"So there's nothing left?!"

I inspected the pile of food cases.

[Taichi]
"There it is."

Croquette roll.
Luckily, Sakuraba didn't check thoroughly, so there
were some left.

[Taichi]
"There's some here."

[Sakuraba]
"I guess stuff like that happens."

[Taichi]
"I'm taking all of it."

[Sakuraba]
"Do whatever."

I grabbed all the food.
Touko was there as well.

[Taichi]
"You grace us with your presence early today."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And out of the uniform, as well..."
"Aren't you hot in those clothes?"

She ignored me.

[Taichi]
"All right, all right."

I shrugged, and sat next to Touko...in my own seat.
I looked at the side of her face.
She was ignoring me but at the same time, she paid
attention to me.

[Taichi]
"Sorry about last night."
"Just as you said, I asked my own heart."
"I was bad."
"But it's fine now. You and I are happy."

Touko moved a bit.
Then she turned to me.

[Touko]
"Taichi...you're always the same."
"It's almost like you don't care about me."
"You leave me, and go on your own."

[Taichi]
"You're right, I'm sorry."

[Touko]
"I just want you to pay a little bit more attention
to me."

[Taichi]
"I gave it thought...so I came prepared."

[Touko]
"Prepared?"

Piled the croquette rolls on her desk.

[Taichi]
"Okay, eat all that you need to!"

[Touko]
"That's not what I am talking about!"

*growl*
But her stomach was growling.

[Touko]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"Your stomach's growling."

[Touko]
"N-no, that's not it!"

*growl, growl*
That was her stomach.

[Taichi]
"Your stomach growled again."

[Touko]
"This is something different!"

[Taichi]
"You can't hide it. Your stomach is trying to
converse with you."

[Touko]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"It's telling you it's empty."
"My stomach is empty too."
"So for the first period class, we'll have croquette
rolls."

I opened the pack and took one out.
Luckily, it wasn't rotten.

[Taichi]
"I guess we should make up too."
"It's about morals, you see..."

Touko looked bewildered.
But...

[Touko]
"Heh."

She laughed.

[Touko]
"It's been days since I heard the word 'class'."

[Taichi]
"You came every day. I thought you were taking
classes alone."

[Touko]
"...I guess I was."

She took a roll.

[Touko]
"I was looking forward to dinner last night."

[Taichi]
"So that's why you're living with me? For me to be
your private cook?"

[Touko]
"N-no!"
"...I was hoping we could eat together."

[Taichi]
"We're eating together."

[Touko]
"Yeah... I guess a guy who doesn't get it never
will."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Touko]
"Let's eat."

She started to eat in frustration.

[Touko]
"It's good..."

[Taichi]
"Anything's good when you're hungry."

[Touko]
"...It's not just that."

She gazed at me quickly.

[Taichi]
"What else is there?"

[Touko]
"Well...the atmosphere's important too."

[Taichi]
"I guess. Hard for me to understand though."

[Touko]
"Well, um...sometimes you feel so sad that you can't
even taste what your eating."

[Taichi]
"This is really good. The sauce has a rich taste."

I chewed while I said it.

[Touko]
"Well, I mean...food tastes different depending on
who you eat it with, right?"

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Touko]
"Agh..."
"I mean, if I wasn't here, you'd be lonely, 
wouldn't you?"

[Taichi]
"Do you not want any more? If so, I'll take the rest."

[Touko]
"I going to hit you if you don't understand that I'm
trying to hint that its good to eat food with
someone you like!!"

[Taichi]
"You already hit me!"

[Touko]
"Lunkhead."

[Taichi]
"A virgin's heart is like French to me.
Indecipherable."

[Touko]
*Sigh* "...I guess a girl from an all-girls school
will never achieve her dream..."

[Taichi]
"Not all guys can achieve their dreams, either."

[Touko]
"What dreams?"

[Taichi]
"An event where I can get it on with a bunch of hot
girls."

[Touko]
"Yuck."

[Taichi]
"Don't say yuck! It's my dream!"

[Touko]
"Do guys always have such perverted fantasies?"

[Taichi]
"If you call that human desire perverted, then a
pedophile must be like an alien from Alpha Centauri
to you."

[Touko]
"Pedo-what?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

She really shouldn't.

[Touko]
"Is it related to schobull?"

[Taichi]
"...Why do you know schobull...oh well."
*Schobull: Fetishes about school swimsuits and PE
shorts.
"Anyway, you can't get it anymore."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

She looked at me doubtfully.

[Taichi]
"So, what's your dream?"

With the bread I was eating, I stuffed my cheeks
like a squirrel, while I asked.

[Touko]
"Stop...don't look at me like that."

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

[Touko]
"I don't like that look...like you're about to
hibernate."

[Taichi]
"I maybe be like a hibernating squirrel, but I'm
still Taichi."
"I'm still wondering why, my princess here was so
irritated."

[Touko]
"..."

Huh?
A blush?

[Touko]
*sniff*

Whoa.
She was crying.
I couldn't watch a lady cry.

[Taichi]
"Wh-why are you crying....what should I do..."

Whoawhoawhoawhoa....

[Touko]
"I'm not happy."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Touko]
"I'm not happy...not happy."

I guess the princess's selfish years have started.

[Taichi]
"What are you unhappy about? What can I do?"

She looked up at me angrily.

[Touko]
"You're not happy living with me."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Touko]
"Yesterday...y-you didn't even do anything with me."

[Taichi]
"I was unconscious because of someone."
"Wait, do nothing? Is that the reason you're upset?"

Does that mean...

[Touko]
"WHAT?!"

[Taichi]
"Touko did you want to have..."

[Touko]
"...!!"

[Taichi]
"...!!"

She fell very silent, and I sat there silently with
her.
It was a beautiful time of peace.
And I kept eating.

[Touko]
*sniff*

Tears welled up.

[Taichi]
"..."

She really was innocent.
The world was destroyed, and she was still thinking
of love.
It's true, she had no where else to run.
That was because of me.
I decided to flirt with her.
I guess this was my punishment...
Or my responsibility.
Either way, it was my duty to stay with her till the end.

[Taichi]
"Okay!"

Touko jumped.

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"I decided to be...your prince."

[Touko]
"...Eh?"

She backed away.

[Taichi]
"Don't worry. I know in your subconscious, you're
searching for your prince."
"Come to me!"

She glared at me with sleepy eyes.

[Taichi]
"Let's get naked."

Her sleepy eyes suddenly opened in shock.

[Touko]
"Huh?!"

[Taichi]
"Okay, strip!"

[Touko]
"Whawhawhawhaaat?"

She seemed even more surprised.
Okay, now time to grab her heart with a killer
phrase.

[Taichi]
"Miss Touko, I love you."

She is mine now.

[Touko]
"Wait, why get naked?"

[Taichi]
"Couples declare their love by letting their
touching flesh do the talking!"

[Touko]
"Wait...but...that's..."

[Taichi]
"Strip!"

I went first and took off my shirt.
Doing so meant that she had to follow... Those were
the rules.
I wondered if she could stop me with her acting safe.

[Touko]
"A-are you for real?"

[Taichi]
"Super real."

[Touko]
"..."

She looked embarrassed.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong? Let's satisfy our desires, other than
eating and sleeping since we're full..."

I took her hand.

[Touko]
"I don't want to satisfy the desires in an orderly
fashion!!!"

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's fool around a bit and get in to
that mood."

[Touko]
"I don't want to do that either!"

[Taichi]
"You want to play it rough?"

My eyes shimmered in delight.
I grabbed her clothes.

[Taichi]
"Let's go, let's go!"

I started to undo her clothes.

[Touko]
"Wait! Wait! This is a school!"

She was lost.
Too bad.

[Taichi]
"No worries, just strip more. Show it to me like an
innocent daughter who reveals herself in a tutu in
front of her father at a dance recital."

[Touko]
"Stop it!"

*whap*

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

I fainted.
When I opened my eyes, Touko was gone.

[Taichi]
"Ughh..."

It's not like it's our first time.
Playing love was hard...
Time to go to the bathroom.
