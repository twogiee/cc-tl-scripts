I think I had been the first one to talk to Miki.
She was a like lovely lamb that had been driven
from her old flock to a new one in Gunjo.
It was her first day.
Apparently, she hadn't brought lunch with her.
I received that information from her classmate
Miyuki, and I went to look for her.
I found her by the front gate, I pretended I was
just walking past.
The front gate was closed as per normal.
Miki was stranded there.

[Taichi]
"Hi!"

[Miki]
"Huh..?"

[Taichi]
"You're cute. What's wrong? Something troubling
you?"

*heavy breathing*

[Miki]
"Uh, umm... No..."

[Taichi]
"What is it? If there's anything you don't
understand just ask me, the school thesaurus. I'll
teach you any synonym you want to know."

*heavy breathing*

[Miki]
"Well... I guess I do have a question."

[Taichi]
"Okay!"

[Miki]
"Why are you wearing a gas mask?"

[Taichi]
"It's a fashion statement!"

I wasn't really in the mood to show my face.
I've got a bit of a complex about it.

[Miki]
"White hair, huh."

[Taichi]
"I dyed it."

*heavy breathing*

[Taichi]
"Is that all you want to know?"

[Miki]
"The gate is closed... I can't go buy anything for
lunch."

[Taichi]
"Hmm. What about your last school?"

[Miki]
"We had school lunch."

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry, Cinderella. But this gate won't open."
"Students can't leave during school hours."

[Miki]
"Oh? But...everything is sold out in the cafeteria."

[Taichi]
"Instinct rules here. Everyone snaps
things up quickly."

[Miki]
"I see. Thanks..."

She turned to go back to the classroom.

[Taichi]
"Wait."

*heavy breathing*

[Taichi]
"Hey, it's past its use-by date, but I have some
bread that is pretty good. You wanna share it with
me?"

Miki's face changed from annoyance to bewilderment.

[Miki]
"No... I think I'm ok..."

[Taichi]
"No need to hesitate. Just leave it to me."

[Miki]
"No, uhh...thanks, but we just met, you know.
Really, thanks."

[Taichi]
"Well, the afternoon would be unforgiving on an
empty stomach..."

[Miki]
"Sorry."

Clear rejection.

[Taichi]
"Okay, fair enough. I'll give you some food, so just
give me something in return, okay?"

[Miki]
"..."

She looked like she was plotting her escape.
She spoke carefully to me.

[Miki]
"Something in return?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Your panties."

She turned to leave.

[Taichi]
"I'm kidding!"

[Miki]
"Umm... Are you just playing with me?"

[Taichi]
"I wish we were playing."

[Miki]
"I feel like you're making a fool out of me."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry. I'm already a fool."

*heavy breathing*

[Miki]
"Okay, but I'm not just about to give my panties
away, you know."

[Taichi]
"So what would I have to do to get them?"

[Miki]
"You will do...anything?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

My eyes burned defiantly.

[Miki]
"Like being my slave for life, for instance?"

[Taichi]
"I wouldn't mind being your love slave."

She was taken aback.

[Miki]
"No, no, not that then. Maybe you should get
on all fours, act like a dog and... Kyan?!"

I was a dog the second she said "dog."

[Taichi]
"Woof!"

[Miki]
"No, not that either! Umm...uhh..."

I guess she was just trying to drive me off my
making unreasonable demands.
But she didn't know me yet.
This was fun for me.
Confidence returned to her face.

[Miki]
"I've got it. Take off that gas mask."

[Taichi]
"Of all things... Ugh..."

I hesitated.
I tend to make a strange first impression.
But whatever.
I removed the mask.

[Taichi]
"Here..."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"The air tastes great without that filter."

[Miki]
"Your hair really is white, huh."

[Taichi]
"That's right."

[Miki]
"Your eyes... Are you wearing contacts?"

[Taichi]
One of my defects is that my eyes are a little
different from most people.
"They shimmer at certain angles, don't they...?"

[Miki]
"Yeah..."

She seemed a bit unsettled.
Eyes carried emotion.
Differences were seen as strange.

[Taichi]
"Sorry. I know it's weird."

[Miki]
"It isn't really."

[Taichi]
"These eyes have caused me a lot of trouble."

The atmosphere grew serious.

[Taichi]
"But my wounds will heal the second this beauty in
front of me fills her belly with food."

I said this while crouching down. I peeked at her
miniskirt.

[Miki]
"Aaaaaahh?!"

[Taichi]
"Ack. She's quick."

[Miki]
"W-what's with you?"

[Taichi]
"I'm the man known as Gunjo's Japanese-English
dictionary."
"But if I have a weakness, it's for the erotic."

[Miki]
"..."

And then...

[Miki]
*grin*

She smiled a little.

[Miki]
"Weirdo..."

[Taichi]
"A shrewd observation. What'll it be then?
Panties? Lunch?"

[Miki]
"Does this mean...you're flirting with me?"

[Taichi]
"You catch on quick."

[Miki]
"It's never happened to me before."

[Taichi]
"Well as far as I'm concerned...
You've been in my sight since you were five."

[Miki]
"You're kind of a creep, huh."

[Taichi]
"Indeed."
"So... Lunch then?"

[Miki]
"Fine. Jump that gate, and go buy me some bread from
a nice bakery. Do that, and I'll eat with you."

[Taichi]
"Ok, then!"

I climbed over the gate.
It was several meters high.
The guards immediately went crazy.
But I was faster than they were. I made it over.

[Miki]
*gasp*

I headed to "Tazaki Bakery."
Also known as Tazaki Mart.
The usual stomping ground.
I bought some bread and drinks.
Then I returned.
The guards were roaming the area looking for me when
I got back.
I snuck through them and scaled the gate again.
The guards had to open the gate to chase after me.
I glanced back at them and went off, looking for
Miki.
She must have gone inside.
I headed back to the school building.
I dashed into the first-year classroom.

[Taichi]
"Hey, I bought us lunch..."
"Ah, this is my classroom..."

Incredible.
Flustered, I headed down to the junior high
section, where Miki have should been.
And from there, the third-year classroom.

[Taichi]
"Hey, I bought us lunch-"

[Kiri]
"...No problem, you should try this too."

[Miki]
"Thanks!"

[Taichi]
"Ahhhh!"

She was already eating.

[Miki]
"Oh... It's that creep from before."

[Kiri]
"Hmm. Yeah. He's been lurking about lately."

[Taichi]
"So uh..."

[Miki]
"I didn't think you'd actually go and do it..."

[Taichi]
"Serious jokes are what I'm all about."

Kiri moved to protect Miki.

[Kiri]
"Out chasing skirts again, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Ngh... If it isn't Little Miss Kick-boxer. I was
just trying to treat this young maiden to lunch,
that's all."

[Kiri]
"She no longer needs it."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Kiri]
"I'll look after her. You needn't bother."

Who did she think she was, being like that?

[Miki]
"Yeah, actually, I'm not really hungry anymore."

[Taichi]
"Huh?!"

[Miki]
"I'm sorry..."

[Kiri]
"It's fine. You don't have to waste your time with
him."

[Miki]
"I know, but..."

[Kiri]
"He's the lowest life form at this school."

[Taichi]
"C'mon now. That's harsh."

I wasn't that bad.
It's not like I was one of those main characters
that held themselves back and played themselves off
as cool and hard to get...
The kind that was popular with girls without really
knowing it...
The kind that was considered cool, but only talked
with their old friends...
The kind that had family issues, and lost their
memory... I wasn't really like that, was I?
I always gave it my all.

[Taichi]
"..."

Like I could be cool like that.
I was a failure...

[Taichi]
"So what should I do with this bread?"

[Miki]
"Can I buy it off you?"

[Kiri]
"Whoa. Gross."

[Taichi]
"Hey, no one asked you."
"I'll just eat it all myself then!"

I sat down, right next to them.

[Kiri]
"W-what do you think you're doing?!"

[Miki]
"Hey, c'mon."

[Taichi]
"Mmm. This is good. Meat that's about to spoil is
good but bread that's about to spoil is good as
well!"

[Kiri]
"Leave us alone!"

[Miki]
"Eek. Huh. Ahaha... Oh no."

A wry smile.
But it wasn't a bad thing.

[Taichi]
"Mmm. Good. So good. That side dish looks tasty,
too!"

[Kiri]
"Hey! That's my lunch box!"

[Taichi]
"What?!"

An argument ensued.

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah...you guys..."

She watched our quarrel with mixed feelings.
