[Taichi]
"We've made it to the beach."
"And here we have the ones full of libido who've
come out to enjoy this fine summer day."

Everyone lined up.

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Umm, so."

I marched like a sergeant in front of the line.

[Taichi]
"You all look like you're about to head off to a
funeral!"

[Touko]
"It's cause you lied to all of us!"

[Taichi]
"Hm, I've got no idea what you're talking about."

I picked at my ear.

[Touko]
"YOU."

[Taichi]
"What are you so worked up about?"
"Is it about that day?"

*smack*

[Taichi]
"Ah."

*insert crazy onomatopoeia equivalent to such an
attack*

[Karade Master]
"Water constitutes half of the human body. Be water,
my friend."
"One must strike with a tough, yet flexible palm.
Strike from below to compress brain fluids, thereby
putting enormous pressure on the brain."

[Taichi]
"Who are you?"

...

[Touko]
"I'm going home!"

[Taichi]
"Well, well."

*grab*

[Touko]
"Heeeeey! Where do you think you're grabbing?!"

[Taichi]
"The material that covers your butt."
"This swimsuit is made of really stretchy material."

[Touko]
"M-Molester!"

[Taichi]
"Ohhh..."

I sunk in the sandy beach.

[Taichi]
"Oof..."

[Touko]
"Unbelievable. You obscene, foolish monkey. What an
idiot. A complete idiot."

Touko muttered to herself and fixed up her swimsuit.
She exposed her butt crack at the same time.

[Misato]
"My stomach..."

Misato felt a little sick. She wasn't good at
getting involved in other people's affairs.

[Taichi]
"Today, the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club are going
swimming at the beach."
"Listen up. I won't repeat myself. You bastards are
scum! The biggest stinky-breathed fat-assed losers
in town!"
"The top brass is paying a heap of maintenance fees
to clean up after lowly bastards like you. It's an
investment with slim odds of return."

[Misato]
"Are we fresh recruits?"

[Tomoki]
"You're number ten."

[Kiri]
"This was a mistake..."

Kiri spoke in a somewhat fed up tone and dropped
her head.

[Miki]
"I'm sorry for tricking you. I couldn't help it
cause he asked me so earnestly."

[Kiri]
"I was going to go out for sushi with my family
today..."

[Miki]
"Hey, now you can call in a favor whenever you need
it, right?"

[Kiri]
"Roe, sea urchins, medium fatty tuna, market
price..."

Kiri sighed heavily at her feet, Ignoring the
military speech.

[Misato]
"How did he get you to come?"

[Touko]
"He just said that Hasekura had something important
to say to me."
"I didn't think for a second someone as great as her
would be on Kurosu's side."

Her clenched fists were trembling.

[Misato]
"I wonder what relationship Hasekura and
Taichi have..."

[Taichi]
"Oh, Youko?"

[All 4]
"Youko?!"

[Taichi]
"A perfectly harmonized quartet."

I shook my baton.

[Touko]
"Wh-why is it that trash like you can go around
calling someone as amazing as her by her first
name?!"

[Taichi]
"There's a minimum level of politeness needed in
conversation, you know?"

[Miki]
"Kurosu, Kurosu, I have a question."

[Taichi]
"Yes, Miki, Miki."

[Miki]
"Um, are you and Hasekura dating, by any chance?"

[All 3]
Touko: "No way! That's not allowed!"
Misato: "Heheh! Beauty and the beast!"
Tomoki: "Something's wrong with the world."

And just like that...
They got into a dispute.

[Miki]
"So, are you?"

[Taichi]
"We're not really dating."
"Youko is just my lover."

I laughed in a devilish little way.

[Misato]
"Eugh..."

Misato collapsed on the spot.

[Miki]
"S-Sergeant, Miyasumi has fainted!"

[Tomoki]
"...!!!"

Tomoki screamed out towards the sea.

[Kiri]
"Shima thinks it's all made up..."

That was Kiri watching out for Tomoki.

[Touko]
"I feel sick... To think that the dignified Hasekura
has been defiled by this deviant Eros."

Yeah, don't mince your words on my account. Geez.

[Taichi]
"One, two, three, four!"

That felt good.
I loved it when people went this way and that
for trivial reasons, just like rubbish.

[Taichi]
"Two, two! Three, four!"

[Touko]
"Shut up! Stop dancing!"

[Kiri]
"I wonder if this is karma."

[Misato]
"Pop, pop."

[Miki]
"S-S-Sergeant! Miyasumi is...frothing at the mouse!
Frothing!"

Things were getting a little chaotic.
Then, we decided to play beach volleyball.

[Miki]
"You want to play beach volleyball to see bouncing
boobs?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah! That's the essence of beach volleyball. I
strategically position myself so I can pass the ball
at an open chest."

[Miki]
"Everyone, that seems like the aim, so be careful."

[Taichi]
"Rest assurred, Miss Miki."

I pat her head.

[Miki]
"Huh?"

I like Miki because she doesn't mind me touching her
like this.
She's super popular with the juniors.

[Taichi]
"Just give it three more years, and yours will grow."

[Miki]
"Oh wow... R-really?"

She blushed.

[Miki]
"I hope so."

[Taichi]
"I know you'll grow!"

[Miki]
"Ohh, thank you!"

[Taichi]
"Kirihara has already stopped growing, so she's
stuck being flat."

[Touko]
"Hey, back off!"

[Misato]
"You guys are so...noisy."

Oh, she came back to life.
Her well-rounded breasts loosely jiggled as she put
one hand on the ground with her legs folded.

[Taichi]
"Misato, you have beautiful breasts."

[Misato]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Beautiful."

[Misato]
"Hey, Kurosu..."

[Girl]
"Umm..."

[Taichi]
"It's just like the forbidden fruit. I may not be
Adam, but I feel like I'm being tempted."

[Misato]
"I-I don't like where this is going..."

She hugged herself as she squatted, vigorously
trembling.

[Tomoki]
"Oi, stop it!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, it's just a joke. Aren't you holding overly
immoral feelings towards your sister? Mr. Sister
Complex?"

[Miki]
"You're the same as the yakuza."

[Tomoki]
"Who's got a sister complex? Say it again?"

He said, suspiciously jittery.

[Misato]
"N-not my body!"

[Girl]
"Oh, uhm, excuse me me me meeeee!"

For one moment...
Everyone stopped moving.

[Taichi]
"Yusa?"

[Yusa]
"I-I'm Yusa. S-Sorry for interrupting at such a
busy time."

She lowered her head to show gratitude.

[Yusa]
"Uh, um... I was invi-vi... Ow!"
*pout*

Seemed like she bit her tongue.

[Touko]
"Who are you?"

[Yusa]
"I'm Yusa Doujima."

[Touko]
"Do you know any of us?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, me."

Everyone went quiet.

[Taichi]
"Hey, is anyone else suddenly really cold?"

[Misato]
"Are you Kurosu's friend?"

[Taichi]
"She's my girlfriend. We live together."

[Yusa]
"Er..."

Silence.

[Miki]
"Living...?"

[Touko]
"Togther?"

[Misato]
"N-not again..."
"He's not telling the truth, is he?"

She asked Yusa directly.

[Taichi]
"Oh, well... That's right. I guess we do live
together?"

[Yusa]
*gulp*

[Kiri]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Misato]
"...Ugh."

[Miki]
"Ah, she fainted again."

[Taichi]
"Just kidding."

[Touko]
"I thought so."

[Taichi]
"She's a timid girl. Play nice with her."

[Miki]
"So your name is Yusa? I'm Miki Yamanobe."

[Yusa]
"Oh, nice to meet you..."

They shook hands.

[Tomoki]
"How lovely."

[Taichi]
"What the hell!"

"Cuck me, will you?! What did he say about Yusa?! My
Yusa!"
I decided to start monitoring him.

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm glad you're here."

[Yusa]
"Mom asked me to give her regards."

[Taichi]
"Okay, okay."

*whisper*

[Taichi]
"Did Youko walk you here?"

[Yusa]
"Yep. But she didn't say a word to me."

[Taichi]
"Haa..."

[Yusa]
"D-Did I make her angry?"

[Taichi]
"No, that's normal don't worry about it."
"So, where is she now?"

[Yusa]
"We were together just a while ago, but then she
just suddenly disappeared."

[Taichi]
"..."

Surely, she had to be out there somewhere.

[Taichi]
"Oh, there she is."

That was her silhouette for sure.
Wearing a full swimsuit, too. What a waste...

[Taichi]
"..."

Well, at least she was joining us.

[Taichi]
"Oh well."

[Yusa]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"Now, since Yusa is here too, should we start having
some fun?"

[Touko]
"That was a long introduction."

[Miki]
"Let's split up into teams."

[Touko]
"Do I have to play, too?"

[Miki]
"But...the numbers."
"Can the two male seniors each split into separate
teams?"

[Taichi]
"You two... Hold on, aren't we forgetting
something?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, I think so too."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Tomoki]
"Hmmm."

We couldn't remember.

[Miki]
"Kiri should come here. Then Kirihara and Miyasumi
should go over there."
"Then, Yusa can come into this small team."

All right, all right.
Misato must be over there.
Shake them. Shake them good.
I was lost in thought with Miyasumi's boobs.

[Taichi]
"Ahh."

[Miki]
"Uhh, we've already started."

[Taichi]
"You didn't even ask if I was ready."
"Ouch, shit! Who did that?"

[Touko]
"Hmph." *looks away*

Must have been her.

[Taichi]
"You dare try to attack before declaring war?!"

I picked the ball up.

[Taichi]
"Our army has been sitting on intel pointing to your
defection for months!"

[Touko]
"Idiot."

[Taichi]
"That attitude is so annoying."
"So annoying that I'm going to...attack!"

And I indeed attacked.
Tomoki easily hit back.
Just what you would expect from a former member of
the sports club.
I hit the ball towards Miyasumi this time.

[Misato]
"Ah, it's here..."

Flustered, she ran this way and that.
The ball ended up hitting the back of Touko
Kirihara's head.

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"S-sorry!"

[Touko]
"...It's fine."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Touko]
"Shut up! Don't laugh!"

It was Touko's turn to serve.
The ball headed towards Yusa.

[Taichi]
"Over there!"

[Yusa]
"Err, um, what?"

She was no match for Miyasumi.
I sent a signal to Kiri Sakura, who seemed pretty
athletic.

[Taichi]
(Sakura,) (help) (Yusa.)

She responded to the signal as our eyes met.

[Kiri]
(Why) (do I) (have to do that?)

[Taichi]
(Enough) (of that!) (You're good) (at sports,)
(right?)

[Kiri]
(So annoying.)

[Taichi]
(Are you) (a monster?)

[Kiri]
(That's not) (my job.) (If you) (want to help,)
(do it yourself.)

[Taichi]
(Outlaw.) (Meanie.) (Lone wolf.)

[Kiri]
(Mind your) (own business.)

Riveting conversation.
It might have all been in my head, though.

[Yusa]
"Oh, it's c-coming this w-way?"

She couldn't speak properly.
It wasn't looking good.

[Miki]
"I got it..."

Miki butt in.
She ran, or rather, slid.
And landed, or rather, fell.
Wow.

[Miki]
"..."

The ball fell by Miki's petite butt, which she had
thrust in front of my face.

[Touko]
"Second point."

[Taichi]
"I see the love in your heart for what it is."

[Miki]
"Kurosu..."

Miki lifted her face, which had gone red.

[Taichi]
"You're bleeding..."

[Kiri]
"Miki?!"

[Miki]
"Oww! My forehead hurts!!"

[Taichi]
"Blood, the blood is..."

There was a splint cutting through the sand.
Blood.
My back muscles started pulsating.

[Kiri]
"Ew, it's been split!"

[Miki]
"Oww..."

[Yusa]
"S-sorry, it's all my fault..."

[Miki]
"That doesn't matter...this hurts right now."

[Taichi]
"Tea, tea!"

I passed the can of tea to Kiri.

[Kiri]
"What are you doing?!"

[Taichi]
"Here, tea!!"

I passed the tea to avoid seeing the blood.

[Miki]
"It's throbbing!"

[Kiri]
"Err, what should we do in this situation?"
"I don't know... I have no clue what to do."

Kiri was getting frazzled.

[Taichi]
"Here, just have the tea!!"

I got flustered too, so it was hard to find the
right words to say.

[Miki]
"Owww... Ouch! There's blood coming out...
What do I do?"

[Misato]
"Are you okay?!"

[Touko]
"I'll call the doctor!"

With that, she ran off.

[Taichi]
"Teeeaaaaa!!!"

[Yusa]
"Sorry, sorry."

[Miki]
"My blood is gushing out! My head is throbbing!"

[Tomoki]
"Wh-what can I do? Is there anything I can do to
help?"

What's he panicking for? He's fine!
Some were crying, others were in panic.
And I was falling apart, unable to bring myself to
look at the blood.
I closed my eyes.
...
Someone took the can from my hands.
I heard the sound of the can opening.
Then the sound of the drink being poured on Miki's
forehead.

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, yeah, that's right!"

[Tomoki]
"Wh-What will pouring tea do to help?"

[Taichi]
"Green tea contains catechins which have an
anti-bacterial effect!"
"I have a handkerchief, in my bag so use that."

[Tomoki]
"O-Okay."

I opened my eyes.
Just in time, Misato was patting Miki's forehead
with the handkerchief.
Phew.

[Taichi]
"Miki, is it still hurting?"

[Miki]
"It's throbbing a bit."

[Taichi]
"Good thinking with the tea. Who thought of that?"

[Misato]
"Well the thing is..."

[Tomoki]
"We don't really know."

[Taichi]
"Whaaat?"

[Misato]
"I saw someone out of the corner of my eye, but I
couldn't make them out clearly in all the chaos."

[Tomoki]
"Same."

[Yusa]
"Me too...I think."

The one with super ninja-like skills was no-one
other than...
Her.
I looked around, but I couldn't see her.
Was that normal?
Then, Touko came over with a lifeguard.
Everyone slumped over at the same time.

[Miki]
"Th-thank you...Kurosu."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"For making me take the tea."

[Taichi]
"I was also confused. And I'm not sure how to
explain why."

[Miki]
"Thanks."

[Taichi]
"To the tea person."

[Miki]
"To you too, Kurosu."

She gazed at me with her teary eyes.

[Taichi]
"Oh, right..."
"You're a good fellow."

[Miki]
"Haa..."

The lifeguard escorted Miki off the beach.

[Kiri]
"I'll accompany her, so you can all head back now."

[Taichi]
"Aye, but we won't be hauling anchor just yet."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"We'll be waiting."

[Kiri]
"Uhh...thanks."

She bowed clumsily and followed Miki.

[Taichi]
"Yusa, they're super cute, right?"

[Yusa]
"Huh? You think so? I thought they were all mature
and I...somewhat felt like the only child present."

[Taichi]
"Do you think those two are sexy?"

[Tomoki]
"That's cause they're a lot older than you, Yusa."

[Taichi]
"..."

He shouldn't be calling her by her first name.
It was way too early for that.
He must have been the kind of guy that cucks you
without even meaning to.
I needed to watch out.
I raised my level of monitoring Tomoki up
another level.

[Yusa]
"I think everyone's great."

[Taichi]
"It's a bond we share by eating from the same rice
cooker. Jealous?"

[Yusa]
"Oh, right, that's awesome."

[Taichi]
"You should join us, too."

[Misato]
"Doujima, are you also going to be at Gunjo?"

[Yusa]
"Yeah, seems like it."
"Originally, I was planning to go to a private
school."
"But with the results from the adaptation test..."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it. We're all the same, too."

[Misato]
"Yeah. Our school is strict with bullying, so you
have nothing to worry about."

[Yusa]
"Good to hear..."

[Touko]
"Wait, will we even still be there when she
enters school?"
"By the way, you look like an idiot with that face."

[Taichi]
"I hope you enjoy your life of eating crappy food
alone in your beach shack. That's the fate of those
who can't parse the mysteries of romance."

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Exactly."

[Tomoki]
"Cut it out... You'll scare Doujima."

Come on, stop trying to act like some knight in
shining armor.
My monitoring increased to level 3. When it hits 4,
I figured he'd swipe my girl.
Find another cuck, buddy boy!

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

I fell.
And I reached for Tomoki's swim shorts.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

My hands slipped.

[Yusa]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"Whaaaaa?!"

[Yusa]
"..."

The innocent, fatherless girl slowly fell to the
ground without making a sound or face.
Kirihara also ran off somewhere.
Pff. He was all talk.

[Misato]
*mumble* *mumble* *mumble*

Miyasumi looked after Yusa who fainted.
Even Miyasumi's face turned bright red, and she
looked both alarmed and unsettled.

[Taichi]
"Uhh, sorry."

[Tomoki]
"Watch where you're going!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

[Tomoki]
"My life is end."

End, end right now!

[Taichi]
"Don't get too down about. Don't you remember that
oath us boys made to stay as virgins till
graduation?"

[Tomoki]
"I guess so, but..."

He dejectedly drooped his shoulders.

[Tomoki]
"Hmm... Maybe I'll go for a swim."

[Taichi]
"And I shall accompany you!"
"Say, comrade."

[Tomoki]
"What now?"

[Taichi]
"It's been bothering me for a while, but..."

[Tomoki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Isn't this Sakuraba?"

[Tomoki]
"Uhh."
"Someone must have stepped on him during all that
chaos earlier."

[Taichi]
"He's still alive."

[Tomoki]
"Sakuraba wouldn't die that easily."

[Taichi]
"I thought we were short one person."

[Tomoki]
"This whole day has been a mess."

[Taichi]
"It was pretty fun, though."

Tomoki half-heartedly agreed.

[Tomoki]
"I guess."

That brought us to the end of a fun day out
at the beach.
It seemed like Miki's injury would only leave a
small scar.
Despite the whole fiasco, Miki went back home
as cheery as ever.
Even though she got hurt, it seemed like
she gained something out of it.
Well, at least that's what her face said.

[Misato]
"Sorry, I've got something to do at school."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Misato]
"Just some preparations for the club."

[Tomoki]
"You're so dedicated."

[Misato]
"Stop being sarcastic."

[Kiri]
"He's not."

[Misato]
"Oh, you think so?"

[Miki]
"He doesn't say stuff like that to the others."

[Kiri]
"Yeah. Shima is a good person."

[Tomoki]
"It feels nice being praised, but let's not take it
any further cause it's embarrassing."

[Miki]
"He got angry."

[Kiri]
"Yup."

They looked at each other and giggled.

[Yusa]
"Heheh."

Yusa awkwardly trailed behind.

[Misato]
"Well, I guess this is my stop. See you around!"
