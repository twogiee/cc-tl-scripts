[Taichi]
"Oh, that reminds me..."
"Just wait here for a bit, Misato."

[Misato]
"Okay?"

I left.
Then came back.
I showed her what I was holding.

[Taichi]
"A handmade popsicle!"

[Misato]
"Wow, that's so cool!"

I gave her one.

[Misato]
"It's like the embodiment of latent human
potential."

[Taichi]
"Heheh, not showing off or anything, but I consider
this my personal contribution to the arts."

[Misato]
"It's cold and so tasty!"

[Taichi]
"Hurrah to mankind."

[Misato]
"Hooray."

All of this over popsicles.

[Misato]
"What is it made out of?"

[Taichi]
"Lemon, sugar, egg whites, and..."
"That's it."

[Misato]
"Did you just leave out something?"

[Taichi]
"I can't say it."

[Misato]
"Why not?"

[Taichi]
"I was going to say some perverted thing like how I
added semen to the popsicle, but I restrained
myself."

My safety mode was on.
She paused.
Her glasses somewhat seemed to fog up.

[Misato]
"..."

It was so awkward.

[Taichi]
"Uh, of course that's just a joke."

[Misato]
"Let me trade with yours."

[Taichi]
"Oh, sure."

[Misato]
"If you keep on spouting nonsense like that I'll
have to punish you."

She spoke in such a monotonous voice.
So scary.

[Taichi]
"I-I'll be careful from now on."

[Misato]
"You better."

The fog from her glasses cleared away.
Wait, did they fog up at her whim?
How the hell would that even work?
I was scared.
But I gained something out of this whole
predicament.
An indirect kiss!
I took my time enjoying the crap out of it.

[Misato]
"I came to say thanks, but left with something to be
thankful for."

[Taichi]
"Heheh, don't fall for me that easily."

[Misato]
"Thanks Pekke. I won't fall for you."

My heart dropped.

[Misato]
"Thanks to you, I managed to cool down."

[Taichi]
"It's hot every day, y'know?"

[Misato]
"Yeah, really hot."

[Taichi]
"I guess that's just how it is since it's summer."

[Misato]
"I want to go to the beach."

She looked out of the window.
It was too dark to see the beach outside.

[Taichi]
"Then let's go."

[Misato]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"Let's meet in front of school tomorrow afternoon."

[Misato]
"Huuh?"

[Taichi]
"Of course, I'll ask everyone else too."

[Misato]
"O-On such short notice?"

[Taichi]
"It'll work out some way or another!"

I gave her a thumbs-up.

[Misato]
"But will Kiri, Hasekura, and the others all come?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, I'll have to figure out how to talk them into
it."
"There's no need for sincerity to make ordinary
people move. You just need to strike at their weak
point. Hahah."

[Misato]
"Don't say things like that with such an innocent
face."
"Oh, but my bathing suit from last year might
not fit."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"Hey, it's not because I gained weight."

[Taichi]
"Ooh, so you've grown?"

[Misato]
"Yep."
"Don't you think I have?"

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm not really doubting that anyway."

Her breasts were probably still growing.
I thought about her bust.
I felt faint just fantasizing about it.

[Misato]
"Er..."

She covered her breasts with both arms having sensed
an air of evil.

[Misato]
"Speaking of which, my swimsuit-"

[Taichi]
"Which one will you wear?"

[Misato]
"You have them?" *flinch*

[Taichi]
"I'm thinking the standard string bikini."

[Misato]
"Why do you have them?!"

[Taichi]
"You're a size 86 and a C-cup, so maybe one of these
will work."

[Misato]
"Huh?!"

[Taichi]
"How about this, the 'Shameless Ocean Paradise' one,
made with shells and lace?"

[Misato]
"Eww, stop it!"

[Taichi]
"Then this one it is! The 'Pearl White Charm'
bikini."

[Misato]
"That one is see-through before it gets wet..."

[Taichi]
"If you want something of a different sort, there's
the strapless patch type, too."

[Misato]
"It's just a band-aid and a tiny piece of loincloth
hanging at the front!! Are you out of your mind?!"

[Taichi]
"Then how about this one? The spot around the
breasts is made of a transparent vinyl material
creating a topless sort of look..."

[Misato]
"Th-That's just asking for trouble."

She hid her face.

[Taichi]
"I've also got loincloths custom-made for women."

[Misato]
"Why do you only have these sorts of swimsuits?!"

[Taichi]
"My personal recommendation is part of the 'Naked
Summer Queen,' it's part of the intelligence testing
line-up that's invisible to morons."

[Misato]
"How's that different from being naked!"
"Get them away from me! All of them!!"
