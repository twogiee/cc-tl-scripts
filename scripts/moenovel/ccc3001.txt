It was early summer of last year.
That was when I met Yutaka Shinkawa.
The cicadas were noisy that summer.
It was a chance meeting.
Our conversation was unusually lively.
We got along well.
Some of the students at Gunjo lived in their own
little worlds.
Others were easily hurt.
It was around that time that the world started
producing something else.
A lot of it hurt people.
Mental illness wasn't just my problem anymore.
I didn't know what caused it.
The government made numerous efforts, but what
they comprised went largely unreported.
Youko said that everything was hush-hush.
The specifics were unknown.
At the very least, the world's slow descent into
madness...was easily understood when I
listened to my heart.
And that was why Gunjo Gakuin existed.
As an isolation institution.
Grade retention was the norm.
But those who didn't recover after several years
were sent to yet another facility.
People like those didn't really needed human contact.
My ability to live on my own might be lacking, but
they were far removed from humanity at that point.
So...
It was hard to make friends at Gunjo.
Because it was hard to make a conversation.
There were ten students in each class, at best.
Only ten whom you could have an actual
conversation with.

[Shinkawa]
"Okay, I feel like I can make it here."

[Taichi]
"..."

I wonder who's at fault.
Was it me?
Or maybe him?
I had no idea.
I couldn't even cry.
Just, not yet.
