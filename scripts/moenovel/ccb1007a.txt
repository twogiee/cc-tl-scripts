[Misato]
"Oh..."

Misato's lower half (nothing too naughty)
was exposed to the bright sunlight.
I saw...bite marks around the bleeding on her leg.
The marks perfectly surrounded the wound, which was
coated in a small patch of thinly spread blood.
It looked as if someone had tried to bite into the
wound.
No.
Any way you looked at it, that's what it was.

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

[Misato]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Do you...hate me?"

[Misato]
"Hate?"

[Taichi]
"The..."

I couldn't find the words.
How could I explain the actions and feelings
that are so hard for me to decipher?

[Taichi]
"Because..."

Suddenly, Misato smiled at me.

[Misato]
"It wasn't you that did anything to make me hate
you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Is...that so?"

But...
I gazed at her wound.
But she gently covered it with her skirt.

[Misato]
"I'm a naive girl so I'll feign ignorance."
"Besides, you helped me with the club."

[Taichi]
"..."
"But let me help you with that at least."

[Misato]
"Okay."

I helped her with her wounds again.
This time, I had no seizure.
Because I was happy.
And I had a wonderful feeling about it.

[Misato]
"It tickles!"

[Taichi]
"S-sorry... I'm nervous."

[Misato]
"You're not very good at wrapping bandages."

[Taichi]
"Well, I don't have any experience..."

[Misato]
"It t-tickles so much!"

[Taichi]
"Hmmmm..."

Such a happy time.
But then...

[Misato]
"Ah!"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"Where did my cell phone go?"

[Taichi]
"Your cell phone?"

The conversation had turned to the mundane.
I could no longer think straight.

[Misato]
"I think I dropped it."

She made a very troubled face.

[Taichi]
"I'll look for it. It's got to be on the rooftop."

[Misato]
"Thank you."

I left the nurse's room and went to the rooftop.
Her cell phone was easy to find.
It had fallen among a bunch of papers.

[Taichi]
"Why did she need her cell phone, anyway?"

It should be obvious.

[Taichi]
"I see."

I came to the answer.
Everyone depended on something,
in one way or another.
And like me, Misato probably put a great deal
of trust into that tiny cell phone.

[Taichi]
"Here it is."

[Misato]
"Ah, you found it!"

She took it with a broad smile.

[Misato]
"Good work. This makes us even."

[Taichi]
"What?"

Her face changed a little while she kept smiling.
As if she heard a bad joke.

[Taichi]
"You forgave me pretty easily."

[Misato]
"That's because I'm a Gunjo girl."
"So, will it happen again?"

[Taichi]
"I don't know. It's possible."
"It was almost like a seizure."

[Misato]
"Well, I'll be sure to keep your special condition
in mind."

[Taichi]
"You're too sweet."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi, you're far too sweet to me."
"I'm not one of those safe young schoolboys, you
know."

[Misato]
"But when I said stop, you stopped, right?"

Did I?
I don't think I understood her words at that time.
Was it coincidental?
It must have been.
Still, I wondered.

[Taichi]
"It probably wouldn't be good to become
close...well...like this..."

My sentence trailed off from there.
It was a silent summer.
So silent that the pressures of club activities and
classwork disappeared.
Just a white nurse's room, filled with tranquility.
The world was bathed in twilight. The room was an
alabaster womb, offering us from its embrace as a
sacrifice to the evening sun.
The evening colors had the strongest impression
of any time of the day.
The whole world seemed to change into something
more bizarre.
A time of destruction.
A time when the world could be seen in many layers.
Who could be sure that the sun didn't rise and set
with the same face it had shown the day before.
As if each and every day perished, and was reborn
again the next day.
How would anyone even be able to tell?
There was no way to know.
There was no way to know if the reality observed by
humans was in fact the same as the real external
world.
But at this moment, the nurse's room felt like a
small sanctuary from the invading scarlet evening.
I could see the world in an unusually vivid way.

[Misato]
"There's no such thing as a perfect person, right?"
"Everyone is strange in one way or another."
"You can't live your life trying to erase every
imperfection and mistake."
"Don't you think so?"

[Taichi]
"..."

If I were to cry even a single tear right then,
I would have looked really lame.
Amazingly, I hid my overwhelming emotions.

[Taichi]
"I was alone, and you invited me to the club,
so I r-respect you."

I let out.
Misato looked out for me.
We silently passed the time together.

[Taichi]
"I can't stand being hated, and I don't want to hurt
anyone."
"That's why I'm really sorry for what happened."
"But I'm not confident that I can control myself."

[Misato]
"What should we do?"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"How can we be more careful? What can I do?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

I calmly gathered my thoughts.

[Taichi]
"If we make sure I don't see your blood..."

[Misato]
"So I should be careful not to get injured, then?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"But things like installing antennas and using tools
carry the risk of getting injured."

[Taichi]
"Sure, so I shouldn't be around when you-"

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She interrupted with her plea.

[Misato]
"You'll help me with the physical work, right?"

[Taichi]
"..."

Her words struck me.
Her words gradually sank into my soul
and left a lasting impression on my heart.
"You're always alone, aren't you..."
"Would you like to join my club?"
Those words would forever be etched into my mind.
They were overwhelmingly warm, soft, and powerful.
The troubles which I couldn't resolve on my own were
erased by another's simple words.
I think that was why humans communicated.
With words, bodies, phones...
With transmissions.
Any way they possible could.
When humans are in contact with other people, they
gain strength.
That's what it meant to be human.

[Misato]
"I'll need your help installing things."

[Taichi]
"Yes."

It was embarrassing.
Misato smiled happily.
Youko sometimes told me that I was a strong person.
I don't like people assigning such values to me.
No.
Other people are often strong.
Mimi always made me feel good, led me around, and
fascinated me.
Those kinds of things... I couldn't possibly do.
I just wanted to be next to her.
As long and as often as I could.
Until the end of days.
Until then, I still had time.

[Taichi]
"I'm looking forward to it."

[Misato]
"Me too."

I hung my head.
When Misato plopped her hand on top of it.
The action caught me by surprise.
And I laughed.
and like that, things were back to normal.
I was so happy I could have cried.
With her hands, Misato drew open the curtains.
And the nurse's room was abruptly flooded in orange.
