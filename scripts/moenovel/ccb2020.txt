I prepared to cook rice in the garden.
I craved rice.
Since I couldn't use the electric rice cooker,
I used the rice canteen.
Here are steps to cook good rice.
1. Believe in yourself.
2. Weigh the rice.
3. Every grain of rice has a precious life.
4. With those infinite lives, humans live on.
5. But eventually, all lives will return to earth.
6. Earth is equal to life, and life is equal to
earth.
7. In the future, to give birth to a new life...
8. Science fiction novel
   "Gaea's Adventures."
    End.
9. Rinse the rice, and leave it in water for at
least 20 minutes.
10. In the summer, funnily enough, you crave really
spicy curry.
11. Cook the rice.
12. Do you fall into dangerous thoughts while gazing
at the flame?
    Or do you remember the comrades
    who died trying to save you? (Two Options)
13. Once it's finished, leave it upside down to
settle for 10 minutes.
14. The birth of an amazingly delicious rice.

[Taichi]
"Done."

[Touko]
"Taichi, I'm so glad you're there."

Touko came over.
She looked anxious.
Her eyes were bloodshot.

[Taichi]
"Hey, you awake?"

[Touko]
"Um..."

She meekly nodded.
She approached me from behind and wrapped her arms
around my neck.
Tightly.

[Touko]
"...Hey?"

She whispered into my ears.
I turned my neck and we kissed.
I tried slipping my tongue in...

[Touko]
"Hey... Don't!"

Our lips peeled.

[Touko]
"At times like these, a light kiss is better."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

[Touko]
"All right, let's try again. A French kiss."

[Taichi]
"A French kiss?"

[Touko]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"You asked for it."

*smooch*
I dived straight into it.

[Touko]
"?!"

She pulled away from me, right away.

[Touko]
"..."

Her face had gone bright red.

[Taichi]
"...Did you get excited?"

[Touko]
"N-no way!"

There was an air of doubt in her tone of voice.

[Touko]
"I said French..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that was a French kiss."

[Touko]
"Oh... Really?"

[Taichi]
"Yep. It's a tongue-to-tongue kiss, where our
tongues twist and dance about. Just imagine two
crown-of-thorns starfish entangled with each other."

*I overexaggerated

[Taichi]
"So things like French toast are also indecent kind
of foods."

[Touko]
"No way, I used to eat it a lot..."

She looked ashamed.

[Touko]
"Topped with caviar too."

[Taichi]
"Enough about caviar."

[Touko]
"What do you call a light kiss?"

[Taichi]
"Um... A soft kiss?"

[Touko]
"Then, do that."

[Taichi]
"Sure."

Our lips met.
No fooling around.

[Touko]
"Mm-hm."

It became a bittersweet atmosphere.
Moods like these are linked to a man's sexual
desire, so it was important to find the right timing
to stop.

[Touko]
"Smells good."

[Taichi]
"Are you hungry?"

[Touko]
"Yeah..."

She looked a little embarrassed.
I didn't see that as a bad thing.

[Taichi]
"Alright, let's eat."

[Touko]
"Whoa, it's rice."

[Taichi]
"At the least, it should be better than the rice
cooked with electric rice cookers... Maybe."

Electric rice cookers these days were pretty good
too.

[Taichi]
"And to go with that, we have retort-pouch curry and
canned food."

[Touko]
"Okay, sounds good."

We ate together.

[Touko]
"H-Hot... Hot hot."

[Taichi]
"You can't take hot foods well?"

[Touko]
"My tongue is weak..."

[Taichi]
"You're right about that."

For various reasons.
Touko went red.

[Touko]
"Mmm..."

She regretted what she said, with the spoon in her
mouth.

[Touko]
"I made a mistake..."

[Taichi]
"Hahaha!"

[Touko]
"But it's good..."

[Taichi]
"It's just retort-pouch curry and canned food."

[Touko]
"What I'm saying is... It tastes good when you eat
with someone you love. No matter what the food is."

[Taichi]
"Sure."

[Touko]
"I wish it would stay like this forever."

[Taichi]
"..."

The evening sky grew dark.
There wasn't a single sign of people about.
