I was sure that Kiri was waiting to strike.
I had felt it in the cafeteria, and on the rooftop.
But she hadn't attacked.
She had patience.
I went into the washroom...
When I came out, I thought I sensed some sort of
murderous intent, but it soon faded.
I slowly walked down the hall.
She could attack any time, any place.
She was waiting until the time was right.
Then she would attack.
Nothing happened in the hall...
Today was hot.
I felt like going to the beach.
Yeah, last year we had all gone to the beach
together.
That had been fun.
I could remember everyone frolicking around
like it was yesterday.

[Touko]
"Heeeeey! Where do you think you're grabbing?!"

[Taichi]
"The material that covers your butt."

[Misato]
"I wonder what relationship Hasekura and Taichi
have..."

[Taichi]
"Hm? My little Youko?"

[All 4]
"My little Youko?!"

[Misato]
"N-Not my body!"

[Yusa]
"Oh, uhm, excuse me me me meeeee!"

[Touko]
"Idiot!"

[Yusa]
"Oh, it's coming... It's cominggg!"

[Miki]
"Oww! My forehead hurts!!"

[Misato]
*grumble grumble*

[Taichi]
"It was pretty fun, though."

And with that, swim time had been over.
It seemed like Miki's injury would only leave a
small scar.
Even then, she went home happy.
Like she had gained something in exchange for her
injury.
Well, at least that's what her face had said.
After that, Misato and I had gone back to school so
I could help her install the broadcast club's
antenna.
Tomoki had said something sarcastic to his sister.
And Miki, who was still a third year at Gunjo,
teased him and his unnatural attachment to his
sister.
Yusa had opened up a little to the group for the
first time.
That was the kind of time we had at the beach.
However the bonds that had been formed were now
broken so badly that people were killing each other.
It broke my heart.
Why did it have to be like this?
I couldn't fight this feeling.
It was upsetting.
I wished everything would just go away.
I just wondered about town, killing time.
There was no attack.
Coward.
And then...
I was back.
It was probably better to be in a familiar place.
Even still...
What was I doing?
No one was around.
Touko had been here just the other day.
Even when other people had disappeared, Touko had
just stayed the same.
She had fought hard for her independence.

[Taichi]
"I know it's not really your thing, but why don't
you try coming to club tomorrow?"

I just said it to myself.
That's what I would have said if Touko had been
here.
It was too late now.
So I went to the rooftop again.
Misato was working.

[Misato]
"All right, here we go."

She was working hard with gloves on.
I didn't want to get in her way.
I closed the door quietly.
So here I was.
I sat in a chair and waited.
I killed time, reading comics.
But I was still aware of my surroundings.
She was coming closer.
Silently.
She wanted to kill.
I could feel her hate for me.
Tension was in the air.
She was coming.
The door quietly opened ever so slightly.
But I noticed.
Even a normal person could sense this urge to kill.
A shiny black arrowhead was pointed at me.
Her rage surrounded me.
I waited for the right time and rolled out of the way.

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

The arrow stuck the place I just was.
I sprung up and leapt into the hallway.
Just in time to see her running away.

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

I chased after her.
Kiri, this chase won't be like Monday.
I tried to hold back my excitement.
I was after her.
Kiri continued to run, glancing over her shoulder
every now and then.
I'll admit, she had gotten faster.
You'll just tire yourself, Kiri.
We passed the front gate.
She headed toward town.
Kiri wasn't so fast holding a weapon.
I set my pace carefully.
I won't let you load an arrow.
I won't let you rest. Not at all.
Before long she went up a mountain path.
I thought she must be suicidal.
And...
Kiri ran out of energy at the shrine.
She hid in the tall grass.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, you finally did it."

You've declared war.
This was war.
With me.

[Taichi]
"You've made an enemy out of me."

[Kiri]
*huff huff huff*

She was desperately trying to catch her breath.
She impatiently tried to load an arrow.
I moved towards where she was.
She must have been struggling.
Only a true expert could reload the crossbow
smoothly in an emergency.
Game over, Kiri.
I took out my knife.
I didn't think I had to kill her.
I took it out anyway.
But why?
It just felt like the thing to do.
Instinct.
Sometimes we just had to go with our feelings.
In order to scare her, I slashed out at grass.

[Kiri]
"Yah! Ah... Aaaah!"

That was all it took.
And then, I...

[Taichi]
"...!!"

I used every muscle in my body to move out of the
way.
She had fired at me. A black arrow flew past me.
What timing!
I was stunned for a bit.
Almost five seconds.
I was completely shocked.
Kiri had been aiming right for me.
I cut down the grass.
But...she was already gone.
I pushed though. I could hear footsteps going back
down the mountain path.
I didn't feel like chasing anymore.

[Taichi]
"Hahah. Wow."

I had almost been killed.
Death.

[Taichi]
"That was scary."

I checked my chest with my hand.
That exhilaration.
I could only feel this joy to be alive
when something awful happened.
I wrote in my journal and went to sleep.
I bet Kiri would attack tonight.
I hoped I could sense her coming.
I sensed a good dream ahead that night.
