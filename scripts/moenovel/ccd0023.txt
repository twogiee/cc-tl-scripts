It was Sunday.
On the rooftop.
Everything was ready.
Or so I thought...
The antenna was destroyed.
And there were only "eight" people left in this
world.
Mimi was at the base of the destroyed pinnacle.
She was crouched over.
I tried to put my hands on her shoulder but she
warded it off.
Tomoki and Sakuraba came.
Touko came.
Sakuraba punched Tomoki.
Tomoki's cheek unnaturally distorted when he was
punched.
The door opened warding off bad omen when Kiri and
Miki arrived.
Kiri was ready for blood.
And it all went downhill from there.
The truth revealed.
Bonds betrayed.
Unity that turned out to be so brittle.
No.
No no no.
Extinction was not what I was hoping for.
Touko died.
The noise rose.
Kiri aimed her hostility towards me.
In that moment, I wanted to kill Kiri.
And, the end...
I ran the hallway.
Voice of the students.
Footsteps.
Sounds of doors opening.
The bell rang.
Silence.
Just silence.
Nothing should be transmitting.

[Youko]
"I think you lived well, Taichi."
"Several times, for tens, hundreds, thousands of
times, looking for possibilities."
"But there was not a happy ending in those times
that Taichi was seeking for."
"They were all close to bad endings."
"And there are only bad endings in this world."
"You understand it now, right?"

[Taichi]
"..."

She came after me along with the smell of blood.

[Taichi]
"Why did you kill them?"

[Youko]
"You only have...me."
"I wanted you to know that."
"Let's just stop."
"And live with just the two of us."

[Taichi]
"I can't do that..."

[Youko]
"Is that so?"
"Then I'll wait, as long as I have to."

The days back at the mansion were filled and soaked
with dark filth.
My reflection was of a female in the window.
Of course.
I was dressed in female clothing.
I had a roommate.
Youko Hasekura.
That Youko Hasekura.
We were taken away each night.
We took damage every evening by people's
animalistic lust.
Every single night.
There were people who got damaged, and people who
inflict damage.
And we saw the fate of those damaged people
countless times.
We had to endure it even if it was the path of
destruction.
Hope that we would live through it.
And we survived, with our hearts and body wounded.
Then made an agreement.
A survival alliance carved into our hearts.
That vow itself was enough reason to live.
If only that man hadn't come...
We worked on our plan.
Our strength was of two children.
And home-field advantage.
Catching the whole herd with one throw was crucial.
There were too many of them to attack individually.
We needed the formula to make the impossible,
possible.
We took our time, prepared tools, trained, observed,
modified, examined, pended, purchased, reformed,
investigated, decided, repealed, and kissed.
What we were giving them was going to be
destruction, and our dignity that was taken from us
was the price.
Our plans, although staggered, was steadily coming
together.
Judgment day came.
14 casualties.
Children became beasts.
And we were...released.
As victims.
Treated as innocent juveniles.
Pitiful victims.
The offender was...

[Taichi]
"A really big...bald...man."

The bizarre monstrous incident was confined
in a deep dark mystery.
The surrounding of the shrine was always maintained
at the same temperature.
Why did I came here.
I've never even came here on my way back from
camping last Sunday.
I wanted to go back.
Right, I wanted to run away.
Away from this world with no people.
From the world we slaughtered.
Because we...
Pushed our way through the grass field.
We passed this area.
Maybe it's a bit wrong to say we passed this area?
My eyes were just frozen.
That time.
The camping I persistently arranged turned out as a
failure and everyone was walking in a bleak feeling.
Consumed the last days of our summer break that
lasted a lot longer than normal schools.
I bet everyone must have felt really unpleasant.
Because I did.
I led the way as if I was running away.
I wanted to run.
Then my eyes caught something.
I instinctively felt the emptiness from the opposite
side.
At that time, I thought I'd rather be alone.
I froze my eyes.
And then the world turned in to a deceiving picture.

[Taichi]
"..."

I was the observer of two worlds.
And I learned that the world was more absurd
than I thought.
Filled with irritation, I kicked the shrine.
The door opened due to the impact.
Opening this was the first even for a mischievous
person like me.
I looked inside.
And was shocked.

[Taichi]
"What...is this?"

Inside was...
Stacks of notebooks from the top to the bottom.

[Taichi]
"What...?"

The notebooks were stuffed in so much that there
wasn't even the slightest gap.
I felt the chills as I pulled one out.
I felt cold.
It was my handwriting.
This one and that one too!

[Taichi]
"This too... Ah, and this..."

I didn't have any memory of writing these.
I followed the writings.
One... Two...
Swelled into confusion the more I read.
Seven... Eight...
My mind instantly generated a question by combining
all the coordinates.

[Taichi]
"It's being...repeated?"

Then I was in love with someone, made up with
someone, and reconciled.
The world ended in a week.
That was all the time there was.
It repeated, had the knowledge that it's gonna
reset, and...
The friendship, bond, unity.
Whatever you call it.
I was pursuing 'that.'
But the results were...cruel.
Happy ending didn't exist.

[Nanaca]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Nanaca...?"

A girl I met at the beginning of the week.
But the note pointed out her existence.

[Nanaca]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"What is this...."
"What kind of situation is this?"
"Everyone is...dead."
"But that meant nothing because everything resets
and starts over from the beginning?"
"What the hell is that?!"
"I've challenged it numerous times..."

Maybe even twice the amount if there were notes that
weren't recorded.

[Taichi]
"And THIS?"

I pointed the hand smeared in blood
from the commotion earlier.

[Taichi]
"Is THIS the only end there is?!"
"Is there an end that's a little...better?"
"How many times did I repeat this?"
"How much more will I have to repeat?"
"How much more mistakes do I have to make?!"
"How many times do I have to go through this
destruction to reach my goal..."
"How many times does everyone..."

I hit the tree trunk.

[Taichi]
"I needed everyone!"
"Did I ever have a happy ending...?"
"You're someone with an amazing power that knows the
answer, right? Answer me!"
"Aren't you the head of this world?!"

I scowled.
She, with sadness, took her eyes off of me.

[Nanaca]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Answer me..."

[Nanaca]
"Hey, it doesn't have to be a happy end, does it?"
"Be with someone and live happily."
"Hang out with friends."
"And just have fun here forever."
"Taichi can live here as he pleases, in a world that
redoing is possible."
"You can live without stressing too much."
"Isn't that enough?"
"And I'm here, too."
"Right?"

[Taichi]
"But on the other side, it could also mean that I'm
putting everyone else in danger, right?"
"Even if I don't, she might carry it out."
"The happy weekend and unhappy weekend
is one and the same."
"The two views refer to both happiness
and unhappiness."
"Happiness can stack as much as it wants to.
But sins..."

I pulled out the stacks of notebooks.
They spread on the ground like dominoes.

[Taichi]
"Sins stays on the notes forever."
"With that... There's no way to live stress-free..."
"It's not easy-going."
"This is... Hell."

[Nanaca]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"What's enjoyable in hurting friends?"
"Why do I burst every time I needed to be patient?"
"How come I'm the precious, valuable one?!"
"If the world resets every time, then how come all
the crimes I've committed are recorded?!"
"What Yutaka did to me can't be fabricated."
"That sin will always be there and exist."
"And so long as there are people, my sins will grow."
"That's why I wanted to get away from the return of
camping."
"I wanted to escape to a place where I can be just
by myself."
"Why did everyone had to get involved?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, Taichi."

A face of sympathy.

[Nanaca]
"That's because Taichi saw...everyone."

[Taichi]
"What...?"

[Nanaca]
"When you were taken in here, you saw everyone."
"You were afraid of being alone, and saw everyone's
backs."
"You observed everyone and pulled them in."

[Taichi]
"I did...?"

[Nanaca]
"You said it yourself."
"You needed others."

[Taichi]
"To hurt them?"

[Nanaca]
"No."
"For you to be yourself..."

[Taichi]
"I...hate myself..."

[Nanaca]
"Don't say that, idiot!"

She nudged me.
I didn't feel anything, but my heart shook a little.

[Nanaca]
"Idiot, idiot..."

She hit me on my chest countless times.

[Taichi]
"Sorry..."

She kept both her fists on my chest and said...

[Nanaca]
"It's true that you have something in your heart
that's very frightening."
"And humans aren't precious."
"And the world isn't beautiful."
"But you have one thing that is beautiful, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"I don't have anything... Just darkness. There's no
beauty in a heart that only knows how to hurt
people."

[Nanaca]
"But that Taichi is yearning so much."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaca]
"You have a wholesome dream and you imitate it...
You want to live without thinking too much, but also
without hurting anyone."

[Taichi]
"That's just what I 'want' to do."

[Nanaca]
"But that's precious."
"You should be a little proud."

[Taichi]
"I... I..."

[Nanaca]
"You can live through this whole week, you know?"

Her voice gently shook my heart.
It was like...
Her voice was coming from my heart.
It was dear to me.

[Taichi]
"No..."

I shook my head.

[Taichi]
"I'll send them back..."

[Nanaca]
"Send...back?"

[Taichi]
"I can send them back to the original world, right?"

[Nanaca]
"But Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"I think I can do it. I remember now."
"I'm not sure what that place is called..."
"I think that place is the best spot for
observation."
"I remember an image of a bright crack there."
"Though I think only I can see it..."
"It might be possible to send them all back from
that place."
"By me, observing them."

[Nanaca]
"Wait wait wait!"
"That means you'll all be by yourself!"

Bitterness.
On the other hand, I was extremely calm.

[Taichi]
"That's fine."

Nanaca was at a loss for words.
I took one of the notebooks.
My days that I had no memories of were spelled out.

[Taichi]
"It says that the name of the broadcast is Cross
Channel."
"Because my name is Kurosu."
"It's a silly pun."
"Transmission is a technology that connects people,
right?"
"Phones, wireless, radio, TV, email, cells, talks,
and letters."
"You can't be together with someone. But for a
moment, you can cross over and feel each other."
"That's what humans do."
"Channels cross."
"That also means that hearts do too."
"It all makes sense. And because of that, I
understand."
"But I can't cross with anyone..."

[Nanaca]
"..."

She hugged me, and it felt like I was enveloped by
sunlight with a sense of calmness.

[Taichi]
"Nanaca...?"

[Nanaca]
"I'm sorry... This is the only thing I can leave you
with..."

Leave me with?
What did she mean by that?

[Taichi]
"Leave me with?"

But she was no longer there.

[Taichi]
"Huh... Nanaca?"
"Nanaca!"

Not even a trace.
Looked like she was completely gone.
A wry smile.

[Taichi]
"I guess I have to do it on my own."

I put the notes back in the shrine.

[Taichi]
"There's not enough space for me..."

That's right.
The past notes were here.
It meant that this shrine was exempt from the rule
of time.
Maybe it wasn't a coincidence that the gate and the
shrine were close to each other.
If then.
I sat behind the shrine.
And then...

[Taichi]
"Wha?!"

Why was it evening all of a sudden?

[Taichi]
"What...is this?"

I looked up at the sky.
The scarlet red turned brighter.
The atrocious deep crimson turned the world
into the color of blood.

[Taichi]
"Mn..."

I got vertigo.
A really bad vertigo.
Closed my eyes.
Like the aftermath of a teacup ride, the vision
swayed and shook.

[Taichi]
"Ahh..."

And the world went dark.
...
...
...
The morning air hit my skin when I woke up.

[Taichi]
"This is..."

I climbed the mountain trail.
Looked for a place to outlook.

[Taichi]
"There's no sign of people..."

I had to know what day of the week it was.
I hiked down the mountain.
...

[Taichi]
"Haah, haah..."

I jumped into Tazaki Mart.
I should be able to check the day.

[Taichi]
"September... Seventh."

That was the latest memo posted.
But that wasn't definite proof.
I ran into the classroom.
At the same time, I was at a loss of words.
She was sitting by the window.
The girl, elbows propped on the desk, glanced
around.

[Touko]
"..."

She looked outside, not saying a word.
I had no words to give her.

[Taichi]
"She's alive..."

I covered my eyes.
In my memory, the girl died yesterday.

[Taichi]
"Ahh..."

I got on my knees, let the numbness from my emotion
take over my body.
Touko glanced over as if she's seen something
strange.

[Taichi]
"L-later."

I waved and gave a cramped smile then left the
classroom.

[Taichi]
"It's Monday..."

It looped.
It looped, and I was still me.
I climbed the mountain again.
I peeked at the crack, but the sense of connection
was gone.

[Taichi]
"It's...gone?"

How could that be.
I panicked and searched around.

[Taichi]
"I see..."

I understood now.

[Taichi]
"It only connects at particular times."

I didn't know the reason, but that's what I
believed.
Besides, I would know by the weekend.
And if I don't, then I just have to search for the
answer again in a week.
I took out the notes from the shrine.
I researched it.
All that happened in this world.
I studied it.
It's fine if there was no flawless happiness.
Everyone getting along was only my desire.
There's still a way to achieve the very best thing
from within the contact of each individuals.
And, that was my cost.
But all the memories lived in my heart.
It was explainable in one sentence.
I wished.
For a paradise where no one gets hurt.
Mutsumi, I'll try my best to achieve that.
And.
And.
And...
