"Oooh..."

I opened my eyes.
I must have fallen asleep at my desk.
I had been dreaming.
It had been the most nostalgic dream.
But my mood turned gloomy.
People ultimately lived for themselves.
People only interacted with each other for their own
selfish reasons.
I headed to the rooftop to cool my sweaty body.
