[Miki]
"Hey there!"

Before long, Miki arrived.
She had Kiri in tow.

[Misato]
"Yamanobe?"

[Miki]
"Yes, I'm Miki Yamanobe. And here I am."
"Greet them too, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Hi..."

[Miki]
"You're too quiet, no one can hear you!"

[Kiri]
"H-hey there!"

[Miki]
"Don't just say 'hey there,' say 'good morning!'"

[Kiri]
"G-good morning."

[Miki]
"Not quite there...do it again!"

Miki slapped Kiri on the ass with a sharp smack.
What a taskmaster!

[Kiri]
"Aiiee!...Don't smack me..."

Kiri was being dominated by Miki.
I wouldn't mind being dominated by her, either.

[Kiri]
"G-good morning."

She gave a slight bow as she repeated her greeting.

[Miki]
"Good, good."

Miki had a sadistic streak in her.

[Taichi]
"What the hell was that bow?! It was like four
degrees short of proper, you know-"

[Miki]
"My delicate Kiri is under a lot of stress,
it's best not to push her."

[Taichi]
"You could have warned me sooner..."

Miki lectured me while I was still down.

[Misato]
"Umm, what can we do for you two?"

[Miki]
"We came to help the club."

[Misato]
"Ah, but... I mean, there isn't much that you can..."

[Miki]
"We came to help."

[Misato]
"Oh, um, but you two haven't been here since..."

[Miki]
"We came to help."

[Misato]
"I do most of it myself, so I'm not sure there is
much for you to do..."

[Miki]
"We came to help."

Misato was frantically trying to deny their help.
Club was nothing more than a way for Misato to avoid
her problems anyway.

[Taichi]
"As expected."

My powers of observation were limitless,
near godlike.

[Miki]
"We came to help out with club!"

Miki continued to pressure Misato.

[Misato]
"Ummm... Hmmm..."

[Taichi]
"There's no other way out of this situation, Misato.
All we're doing is wasting away here anyway, might
as well just give in and have some fun!"

[Misato]
"Aagh, you can't be serious, Pekke!"

Her face was smiling.
But she was still strong.

[Miki]
"Well then, what are you orders?"

[Misato]
"Umm... I need to think about it."

[Miki]
"Heheheh..."

[Misato]
"Is Kiri with you as well?"

[Kiri]
"I-I was...forced by Miki..."

[Miki]
"It was uncontrollable lust."

She spoke in a hushed tone.

[Kiri]
"Please let us help."

Kiri stood straight as she made her request.

[Misato]
"Well then... I guess..."
"All right... Thanks for lending a hand..."

[Miki]
"Yeeaah, welcome to typical high school life!
...Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"Y-yeeaah...welcome to typical high school life..."
*Sigh*

[Misato]
"But why are you two suddenly..."

[Miki]
"Just something I'm trying out. Don't worry about
it..."

[Taichi]
"She's dead-set on it."

[Misato]
"Means you're also going to help, hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry... But, Miki..."

[Miki]
"Be more gentleman..."

She spoke in a hushed tone.

[Taichi]
"As you wish, your highness."

I saluted her as I responded.

[Misato]
"Are you a soldier now, Pekke?!"

[Taichi]
"What are you going on about?"
"I, Taichi Kurosu, have never once forgotten my
Prussian spirit."

[Misato]
"And yet you seem more like some run-of-the-mill
Genghis Khan."

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm a kind of Japanese Prussian, at any rate."

[Miki]
"I guess that'd make you a hunter of the Japanese
Alps."

[Taichi]
"It is as you say, your highness."

[Miki]
"Taichi and Kiri are both well-behaved, so please
use them to their fullest."

[Misato]
"Well, all right then. If that's the case, please
give it your all."

[Miki]
"Well, if you have any really heavy stuff that you
can't carry by yourself, they can handle it."

Miki and her manipulative ways...

[Kiri]
"But I can't really carry that much..."

Kiri seemed as if she would cry.
For the time being...
My shrine visits were put on hold.
Some hours later.
Club was finished.
On the way home, I looked up towards the rooftop.
I could see the tip of the antenna.
And next to it...
Stood Misato, still hard at work.

[Taichi]
"..."

She was immersed in club activities.
Just like an ideal student.
But even though it seemed like she was just a
wholesome student, I knew she was doing it for her
own reasons.
Anyway...

[Taichi]
*sigh*

I was beat.

[Kiri]
*sigh*

It seemed Kiri and I were in the same condition.

[Miki]
"What a full day we've had!"

Oh, for sure.
It must have been tiring bossing us around.
If you are going to throw around orders, at least do
it with some tact.

[Taichi]
"Okay, that's it for me."

I started walking.

[Kiri]
"See you later, Miki."

[Miki]
"Okay, bye-bye!"

I heard footsteps approaching me from behind.

[Miki]
"Let's walk together until the shopping street."

Miki fell in step next to me.

[Taichi]
"Sure, suit yourself."

I was absolutely beat.

[Miki]
"Oh hey, I got those pictures developed!"

While Kiri and I were slaving away at club, Miki had
gone to the darkroom.

[Taichi]
"You know, thinking about it, there are only eight
people in the world you can show those to. Six not
including us."

[Miki]
"That's exactly what Kiri said to me... So, will you
quit club?"

[Taichi]
"Well, I've come this far together. Might as well
go with it."

[Miki]
"Eheheh!"
"You're so strong, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"You think so?"

[Miki]
"I enjoy watching men carry things around so briskly.
It's a good thing I lent you out to club!"

Was that the only reason...?

[Miki]
"That kind of work really is admirable. I'll treat
you to a drink at the shopping street."

[Taichi]
"Hahah, thanks..."

My expression was less than amiable.
This girl...

[Taichi]
"Well, it's much better to have something to do."

[Miki]
"True, true."

[Taichi]
"And just have to spare some time to think about
important stuffs."

[Miki]
"Let's go with a school drama this week."

[Taichi]
"What about next week?"

[Miki]
"Uh-uh. That's when the eight of us will look for
other survivors..."

[Taichi]
"Sounds fun..."

Those were the times we lived in.
Until there was no one left, at least...

[Taichi]
"But I think it'd be better if we just kept doing
what we're doing."

Acting normal would bring a sense of normalcy to our
situation, after all.

[Miki]
"I see..."

We arrived at the shopping street.
Miki treated me to a soda after all.

[Taichi]
"It really did feel like a regular day today."

[Miki]
"Yup!"

The evening sun shone on the horizon.
To me, it illuminated the twilight of humanity.
