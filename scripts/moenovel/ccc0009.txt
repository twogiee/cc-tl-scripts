Why don't I stop by?

[Taichi]
"Mm?"

Something's wrong...
I stayed in front of the entrance.
I checked inside.
Was it a friend or foe?

[Taichi]
"Mountain...?"

[Miki]
"River..."
"Throughout Heaven and Earth...?"

[Taichi]
"I am the only Lord."

[Miki]
"...Come on in."

I entered the shop.

[Taichi]
"Miki... I thought it was someone else."

[Miki]
"Good morning, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"I felt a kind of bloodlust coming from this place."

[Miki]
"If something were to happen in this enclosed space
with no way out, it'd be pretty bad, right?"

[Taichi]
"You're right."

An old memory came to mind.

[Taichi]
"Since, you're wearing the uniform, does that mean
you're going to school today?"

[Miki]
"Yep. I don't have anything else to do, so..."

[Taichi]
"Same as me, huh?"

[Miki]
"Makes sense."

She was so innocent.

[Taichi]
"Can I get a drink?"

[Miki]
"Sure, try this."

[Taichi]
"You always give me the rarest stuff, thanks."

It was a certain product that was easily recognized
by its pale liquid.
The taste was absolutely terrible.
Fortunately, I reveled in terrible foods and drinks.
This was no big deal.
I killed it in one big gulp!

[Miki]
"It's best if you didn't look at the expiration date."

[Taichi]
*gag*

It went down my windpipe.

[Taichi]
*cough cough*

[Miki]
"Hah, I knocked that one out of the park."

She struck a pose.

[Taichi]
"Don't do that to people...!"

[Miki]
"My baaad."

She said jokingly with a smile.

[Taichi]
"Psh, this dumb virgin..."

I spat the words out angrily.

[Miki]
"I'm saving myself until I'm 20."

[Taichi]
"You shouldn't turn 20 in the first place."

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Stay the way you are forever."

[Miki]
"...I probably can but I don't want to."

I supposed she had a point.
But more importantly...

[Taichi]
"So, who are you saving yourself for?"

[Miki]
"Eh...? Hmmm... Falcon Kato."

[Taichi]
"Your focus is on technique?!"

I let out a lamented sigh.
He was the leading technician in Japan.
I couldn't beat that.

[Taichi]
"I'm not Falcon, but I have confidence in my skills,
too."

[Miki]
"Since your skills are limited to sexual harassment,
I'm not certain how you'd actually perform in the
act. With that said, I apologize, but go away."

The final inflection in her words was so assertive,
like some kind of proud warrior.
That rejection made my heart liable to be broken.

[Taichi]
"Heh, you say that but you're going to give yourself
to Kiri, aren't you? You lewd virgin."

[Miki]
"Actually, I'm going to steal Kiri's virginity."

[Taichi]
"...I would like to join that."

The lust clouding my mind...increased by 82\p.

[Miki]
"Why don't we go to school and make it happen then?"

[Taichi]
"All right, let's go."

We linked hands and made our way to school
together.

[Taichi]
"Under the big blue sky..."

[Miki]
"Together, you and I..."

We sang a carefree duet on our leisurely way to the
school gates.

[Miki]
"..."
"Ah, I forgot to bring a drink for Kiri."

She realized it just as we'd reached the school.

[Taichi]
"You dummy. You need to be more careful."

[Miki]
"I'll be right back."

[Taichi]
"Sure, take your time up and down that hill!"

[Miki]
"Okay."

And with that, she went on her way.
She's a cute one.

[Taichi]
"..."
