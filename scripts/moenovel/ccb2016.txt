I had to carry Touko's luggage on our way home.

[Taichi]
"Hrrrngh."

[Touko]
"Hang in there, Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"All right..."

I didn't had the right to disobey.
Her stuff was light.
But still, I was tired from all the hills.

[Touko]
*hum hum hum*

She sure was at ease.
But after all, I was just thankful she hadn't gotten
that angry.

[Touko]
"Hey, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah?"

[Touko]
"Are we really going to the beach?"

Ahhh...
I see.
People tend to get happier when they had 
something to look forward to.
Even though everyone died alone.
Meaning, we end in solitude.
Expectation had the power to make us forget that.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, let's go."

[Touko]
"Yay!"

[Taichi]
"Do you want it to be just us two, or with everyone?"

[Touko]
"Everyone?"

[Taichi]
"Well, let's just invite everyone and go with
whoever wants to join in."

[Touko]
"I wonder if anyone will..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

Sakuraba was fine.
I wondered about Tomoki. He might be busy with
the Life Support club activities.
Misato probably had some club activities too.
Miki was probably okay.
Kiri was tough, but if Miki came
she'd likely join in.
Youko was out of the question.

[Taichi]
"I think a few will."

[Touko]
"Well...which do you prefer?"
"Going as a group, or just us two?"

She glanced at my face to check my reaction.
Like she wasn't really used to affection.
Like she was still floundering a bit.
I liked that about her, her openness.

[Taichi]
"..."

Now that I thought about it, I guess I really liked
Touko.

[Taichi]
"Haha!"

[Touko]
"Hn?"

[Taichi]
"So how about we all go tomorrow, then a trip
with only the two of us next Friday?"

She suddenly beamed.

[Touko]
"Yeah, that's a good idea!"
"We'll have to prepare lunch too."

[Taichi]
"I'll make them, okay?"

[Touko]
"And I'll help."

[Taichi]
"Uhm, I think Harakirimaru's a bit too long for the
kitchen."

[Touko]
"As if I'd bring a sword!"

But you could summon it when needed, right...

[Touko]
"But can you get everyone together
on such short notice?"

[Taichi]
"It's not like I'm busy this evening."
"Anyway, I'm nocturnal.
I like getting out in the dark!"

[Touko]
"So you're a night man?"

[Taichi]
"Aaaah... Not quite like that."
"Anyway, just leave it to me."

[Touko]
"..."
"Let me take half of my luggage."

Now, now.

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it, this is nothing."

[Touko]
"Well, I'll help you this way."

She linked arms with me.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

[Touko]
"Heheh."

She wasn't of any help at all...
But, that was okay.

[Touko]
*hum hum hum*

Whenever I saw her face sideways in the sunset, my
perverse imp get to be so restless.
It wanted to thrust forth...
Into our final, hopeless days on this world.
I closed my eyes tight.
The sunset was bad.
It represented the color of world destruction.
Long ago, I thought that the world ended every night.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

At the top of the hill...
She was there.
The bike girl.

[Nanaca]
"..."

She held one arm straight out to the side.
He finger pointed out toward something.
I looked.
Was she pointing at the mountain?
Or...the road leading to the campground.
When I turned back, she was gone.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Touko]
"Hey, let's cut each other's hair next week!"
"Let's cut it short. It'll make us feel refreshed
and we'll be able to live life with a smile!"
"We can live like farmers and eat corn for dessert."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

I guess Touko hadn't seen what I'd saw.
Even though she'd been right in front of us.
It was a little strange.

[Taichi]
"So, why corn?"

[Touko]
"If it was served at a formal dinner, how would
you eat it?"

[Taichi]
"Huh? Is it with a knife and fork?"

[Touko]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't it be so hard to cut it with a dinner
knife?"

[Touko]
"Then how about if it was served as a dessert?"

[Taichi]
"Uhm..."

Touko giggled.

[Touko]
"You could eat it with your hands."

[Taichi]
"Huh, is that so."

[Touko]
"So what about a banana?"

[Taichi]
"Peel it by hand."

[Touko]
"Buzz, wrong answer!"

[Taichi]
"You cut it with a knife?"

[Touko]
"Right."

[Taichi]
"Ugh, I don't get table manners at all!"

[Touko]
"If we lived like that, I bet a lot more people
would be here."
"Because they'd all come back."

She still had hope, it seemed.

[Taichi]
"Yes, or produce them ourselves!"

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

It made me want to kiss her.
I took her chin.

[Touko]
"Perv..."

*chomp*

[Taichi]
"Owww, don't bite my finger!"

Later that night, I stuffed myself with canned
goods.
