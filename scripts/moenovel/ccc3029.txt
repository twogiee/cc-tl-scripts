At home.
This was usually a lonely space, but today a blossom
had planted herself here.

[Taichi]
"Come on in."

[Kiri]
"S-sorry to bother you..."
"Whoa..."

My bedroom was adorned with my love for chaos.
Visitors were often surprised.

[Taichi]
"Have a seat."

[Kiri]
"...Where can I sit?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed her a rake.

[Kiri]
"...A rake?"

[Taichi]
"Make room for yourself."

[Kiri]
"..."

Better for her to handle herself.
Kiri sat down in the open space which she created
with the rake.

[Kiri]
"Is this really what men are like?"

[Taichi]
"Sit tight."

I went downstairs briefly and came back with a
tomato in hand.

[Taichi]
"Here, it's full of vitamins."

[Kiri]
"...Thanks."

She hesitated a moment before taking a bite out of
the tomato.

[Taichi]
"You can relax. Since you are going to live here
from now on."

[Kiri]
"Mm-hm."

She suddenly froze in her place.

[Kiri]
"From...now on?"

[Taichi]
"You don't want to?"

[Kiri]
"I don't know..."
"You know Taichi, you were my first..."

Whoa.

[Kiri]
"And I think this as my atonement."
"For Yutaka and I..."

Yutaka, huh?
I guess that's what Kiri is going to be from now on.
Yutaka, Yutaka, Yutaka.
Yutaka.

[Taichi]
"Shall I help you eat the tomato?"

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

I snatched the tomato from Kiri's hands
and took a giant bite out of it.
And then I kissed her.

[Kiri]
"Mm?!"

I slid the bite of tomato into her mouth.

[Kiri]
"Mm..."

She only gave a moment's resistance.

[Taichi]
"Does it taste good?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"Then let's have some more."

I continued feeding her that way.
Kiri's face had flushed by the time we finished the
tomato.

[Taichi]
"You're mine and mine alone, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Yes I am..."

[Taichi]
"And yet you seem so sad."

Kiri forced a smile onto her face in reply.
It looked nothing like a smile, more like a cramp.
I wrapped my arms around her
and forced her to the ground.

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

What was left of the fruit fell to the floor.
The shrine was ominous in the dead of night.
I placed my journal.
The sixth notebook.

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah..."

I paused in thought.
These journal notebooks were being enshrined there.
From tomorrow, the world will rewind.
So the notebook will be gone.
This was the reason why I couldn't find the notebook
on Monday.
But within the shrine, it appeared as if the laws of
the rewinding world really didn't apply.

[Taichi]
"I see..."

I placed my journal within.
A good save point.
The moment I finished that last journal, my life...
my solitary life, had begun.
There was no going back.
Just one day...this was the final day.
I figured I'd better live that life to the fullest.
