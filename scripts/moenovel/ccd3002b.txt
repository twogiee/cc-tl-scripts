[Taichi]
"Kiri."

Her whole body stiffened.
She slowly turned around.
Her expression was austere.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Kiri]
"What do you want...?"

Her tone of voice was low.

[Taichi]
"Is Miki here?"

[Kiri]
"No she isn't."

[Taichi]
"I see."

I knew.

[Taichi]
"She was walking about the shopping area.
She seemed really depressed."

[Kiri]
"Really...?"

[Taichi]
"Why don't you go to her?"

She fled the classroom without responding.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Here's lunch I promised I give to Miki."

This was a lie.
But Kiri wouldn't take it unless I said that.

[Kiri]
"Why do you have it...?"

[Taichi]
"Now hurry on. She was crying."

She glanced at me suspiciously and ran off.
This was good.
I took a deep breath.
I needed another before dealing with Kiri.
On Sunday, the world would rewind.
The day of reckon.
This world might be a utopia.
A world where any fatal wounds weren't fatal.
In the matter of a week it would be like nothing had
ever happened.
Even if you hurt or shared a moment with anyone.
Reset.
Once I got along with Touko, then it would be Mimi.
Then Kiri.
Then Miki.
Then Youko...if I felt like it.
Then Sakuraba.
Well, maybe not him...
However.
I had the resources and also a place which was
outside the loop.
I had to use all my resources to make things work.
So I...
It was early in the summer of last year.
That was when I met Yutaka Shinkawa.
The cicadas were noisy that summer.

[Shinkawa]
"Okay, I feel like I can make it here."

[Taichi]
"..."

Who was to blame?
I couldn't blame it on fate or circumstances.
It was someone's fault or even everyone's.
If that was the case, there weren't many conclusions
to be drawn.
