*thud* I felt something hit my body.

[Taichi]
"Mph..."

That's right.
I came to understand it.
A single arrow had pierced my chest.
Yes.
That's it.
I must have moved.
Then Kiri shot me.
It was easy to understand.

[??]
"#####?!"

Who was it going to be?
Who was going to worry about me?
Misato?
Touko?
Miki?
If it was Sakuraba or Tomoki, that would suck.
Sorry. I'd rather die.
Our sworn brotherhood... I couldn't protect it...
But, I guess it was already broken.
Hah hah hah.
Hah hah hah hah.
I wanted to laugh, but no sound came out.
From my chest, a pressure seemed to grow and grow.
When I looked, my legs were covered with blood.
Blood that was gushing out of me.
This was bad.
Damn, I was gonna die.
I didn't want to die.
I really wanted to keep living.
I wanted to have sex, watch TV, finish all the
comics I was reading.
I didn't want to die.
Ah...but I was a young adult, so maybe my life-force
would miraculously return.
Maybe a beautiful girl would cradle my body and when
her tears struck my body I would resurrect in a
miracle.
What a beautiful image.
Maybe I should try to make a joke while I was on the
verge of death.
That would have been the cool thing to do.
But if I couldn't move or talk, I couldn't do
anything cool.
I couldn't do anything...
Whoa! Was I going to die like this! No!
Someone shoot me with a toy gun, the ones when the
little flag comes out, it says "BANG! YOU'RE DEAD!"
Someone laugh! Laugh with me!
Damn! The blood was horrible!
It spread all over, covering me.
For a human to make this much blood... It didn't
seem possible.
I was all red.
Color was fading from my vision, but I was still
myself.
...Strangely, It was almost like I was back to
normal.
Yeah.
This was good.
My head had all of its senses back.
Maybe this was just temporary.
Maybe it was just my body going into shock.
Even so, nothing was going to save me.
I couldn't keep my consciousness going.
My breathing was becoming unnaturally shallow.
I couldn't even feel pain.
I looked up.
It was red everywhere.
This is it.
At that instant, I died.
