I arrived at Touko's house.
No... More like Touko's Mansion.
It was pitch black inside.
All the windows were closed up.
I took out a flashlight and headed to Touko's room.
I had been to this house many times.
Once, Touko had almost introduced me to her father.
But I had ran away...
I reached the second floor.
I checked each room one by one.
She had to be here somewhere.
I opened and checked each door, when...
The room was flooded with light.

[Taichi]
"..."

The windows of the room were wide open.
A gentle breeze circled around the room.
There she was.
Something smelled rotten.

[Taichi]
"Touko..."

A knife was stuck in her chest.
There was no doubt it was murder.
The knife looked like it was from around here.
It was beautifully ornamented, like a piece of
furniture.
There was a lot of blood.
It was everywhere from her chest to the sheets,
everything was stained a blackish red.
But still...
She was a lovely corpse.
A very Touko-like, dignified corpse.

[Taichi]
"..."

For a moment I stood still.
For a moment in time, my heart was frozen.
Touko was no longer with us.
It almost felt like if I pulled out the knife, she
would suddenly wake up.
At least that is how it seemed.
So...who had killed her...?
Sadly there were only a handful of possible suspects.
Kiri.
Miki.
Tomoki.
Sakuraba.
Mimi.
Unless there was someone else, that was everyone.
Kiri.
I didn't think that she would have done it.
She had been the first person to find the body.
But, it was hard to imagine that she had done it.
Even still, she had some real anger at times. That
did confuse things a little.
Miki.
There was a possibility that it was her.
I couldn't really imagine the motive, though.
Even if she had an alibi, there probably wasn't a
way to prove it one way or the other.
I didn't have much to go on, but she seemed to be
the top suspect.
Tomoki.
He was the No. 2 Suspect.
But there was no clear motive.
Sakuraba.
Suspect No. 3. No clear motive.
Mimi.
Suspect No.4. No clear motive.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

That was about all I had right now.
I couldn't come up with a motive, nor could I imagine
who had done it.
But the person that killed Youko, had probably
killed Touko too.
Detective work was hard...
I found suspect No. 2 near the main entrance.
I began my interrogation.

[Taichi]
"What's your age?"

[Tomoki]
"I can't say."

Typical Tomoki.
My sudden interrogation didn't work.

[Taichi]
"Why can't you tell me your age?"

[Tomoki]
"I can't say why."

[Taichi]
"You can't say why either?"

[Tomoki]
"That's right...sorry."

[Taichi]
"Let me ask another way. Are you over or under 20?"

[Tomoki]
"Under."

[Taichi]
"Under 18?"

[Tomoki]
"I can't say."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm. 17, right?"

[Tomoki]
"I definitely cannot say."

[Taichi]
"You're a high school student, right?"

[Tomoki]
"That doesn't even exist in the current world."

[Taichi]
"Which is worse, a high school girl or a girl from
an all-girls high school?"

[Tomoki]
"I can't really say either is worse."

[Taichi]
"Do you know what a student handbook is?"

[Tomoki]
"That doesn't even exist in the current world."

[Taichi]
"What's your age?"

[Tomoki]
"Pubescence."

[Taichi]
"So I can't confirm your age, huh?"

[Tomoki]
"I suppose not."

This guy was really cautious.

[Taichi]
"Hey Mr. Sister Prince, even in these times, minors
exist, you know?"

Probably.

[Tomoki]
"..."

He ignored me. Real mature.

[Taichi]
"Hmph, acting all naive."
"I'll tell you. I'm 17. See."

[Tomoki]
"..."

Tomoki started to sweat.

[Taichi]
"Heheh, what's the matter? Nervous?"
"Then let me tell you again."
"I AM 17!!"
"SEVEN!! TEEEEEEEEEEEN!!"
"SEEEEVEEEEEENTEEEEEN!!"
"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!"

[Tomoki]
"..."

Tomoki looked at me and cried silently.

[Taichi]
"Quit acting so pitiful!!"

Forget it. I can't do this.

[Taichi]
"So what's wrong?"

[Tomoki]
"Nothing. I just wanted to go home."

[Taichi]
"You stand very straight. Like a radio antenna."

[Tomoki]
"I'm leaving. I'm just going home..."

Tomoki left sluggishly.

[Taichi]
"What's with him?"

I took in the view from where he had been standing.
The roof top.
The antenna.
And...
Mimi.
She was clinging to the fence as she looked out.
After a moment, she disappeared behind the antenna.

[Taichi]
"?"

Those two had been fighting.
But it wasn't like they would kill someone.
Miki came out of the restroom.

[Miki]
"Oh, hiii."

[Taichi]
"Suspect No. 1."

[Miki]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"What's your age?"

Miki smirked.

[Miki]
"I'm 15."

[Taichi]
"Why can't you tell me your age?"

[Miki]
"I just told you."

[Taichi]
"Oh... Right."

[Miki]
"It seems like you are suffering some sort of mental
breakdown."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing..."

[Miki]
"I'm 15."

I bowed.

[Taichi]
"I'm 17."

I bowed.

[Miki]
"Fifteen."

[Taichi]
"Seventeen."

I bowed.

[Taichi]
"SEVENTEEN!"

[Miki]
"FIFTEEN!"

She cringed.

[Taichi]
"I'm a minor."

[Miki]
"Me too."

[Taichi]
"WOO HOO!!"

[Miki]
"YAY!"

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahah!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah!"

What fun.

[Taichi]
"All right, answer this. At your school, your
student handbook is for both high school girls and
girls from all-girls schools, right?"

[Miki]
"Exactly!"

[Taichi]
"I see... Lastly, tell me your age."

[Miki]
"I'm 15."

I stared into Miki's pupils.
She stared back.
We brought our hands together.
We spun and danced.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah."

[Miki]
"Heheheh."

There was compassion there.
There was also understanding, liberation, and
emotion.
The two of us could dance forever.
Then Kiri came out from the restroom.

[Kiri]
"Taichi Kurosu!"

My eyes broke off from Miki's.

[Kiri]
"Miki, you can't talk with that person!"

[Miki]
"Huh? But?"

[Taichi]
"We don't need to talk. As long as we can dance."

[Kiri]
"You can't dance either!"

[Miki]
"Why?"

[Kiri]
"He's dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Are you still saying that?"
"I saw Touko. She's dead."

[Kiri]
"So shameless."

[Taichi]
"One of our friends is dead. Is vengeance is the first
emotion you have?"

[Kiri]
"You shouldn't...say such things..."

I really shouldn't say that...

[Miki]
"So who did it...?"

[Taichi]
"Looks like we're all suspects."

[Miki]
"What should we do...?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe we should just all stay together."

[Kiri]
"No way!"

[Taichi]
"I thought you would say that..."

[Kiri]
"I'll be with Miki. You go be by yourself.
...You're the one that did it anyway."

[Taichi]
"That's fine..."

[Kiri]
"Don't come near Miki either."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."
"Who said you make all the rules anyway?"

[Miki]
"Here we go again..."

[Taichi]
"I'll talk to whoever I like and they can talk back
to me if they like."

[Kiri]
"Not Miki..."

[Taichi]
"That's not for you to decide."

[Kiri]
"Miki... She's my first real friend."
"I won't just stand by and let you harm her."

[Taichi]
"But it's not only up to you..."

[Kiri]
"You've always been mean...
And with those test results..."

Her eyes welled up with tears.
*sniffle*
I was dejected.

[Taichi]
"That's not my fault..."

[Kiri]
"I will not...let anything...happen to my friend."

[Taichi]
"Whatever..."

I couldn't handle Kiri anymore.
For many reasons.

[Miki]
"Stop it Kiri. Don't blame him for everything. What
if he's not the one that did it?"

[Kiri]
"Like that could be the case..."

[Miki]
"You just decided he was the one that did it by
yourself."

[Taichi]
"Hey?"

[Miki]
"Right?"

I got along well with Miki.

[Taichi]
"If anyone, I suspect either Sakuraba or Tomoki did
it."

[Miki]
"What an interesting sense of friendship you guys
have."

[Taichi]
"We are pretty cut and dry with each other."
"On the other hand, if Mimi is the perp... I-I-I'd
have to body search her...and what a bod-"

[Miki]
*shriek*

[Kiri]
"Stop it..."

[Taichi]
"You too. If you were the perp...I'd have to do all
kinds of things to you, you know?"

I pretended to puff on a cigar.

[Kiri]
"Quit it!"

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

[Kiri]
"That's why I don't understand why
you'd get close to this guy!!"

*silence*

[Kiri]
"He's trouble! He's dangerous!"

[Miki]
"Kiri...you don't have to be so vigilant."

[Taichi]
"Hey, it feels like you want me dead."

[Miki]
"Kiri, you went too far."

[Kiri]
"Miki, you're too soft. She was like a sister to him
and still he killed her!"

[Miki]
"But Kiri...we don't know..."

[Taichi]
"It wasn't me, you know! She was already dead."
Somebody stabbed her.

[Kiri]
"So you know."

I sighed, feeling ready to be sick.

[Taichi]
"Agh. Miki help..."

[Miki]
"Kiri stop it."

Miki's eyes hardened.

[Kiri]
"Why...? I'm just...trying to look out...for you."

[Miki]
"You're still going to say that?
You'll lose me as a friend."

[Kiri]
"Miki..."

[Taichi]
"You don't have to stop being friends."

[Miki]
"I'm not her puppet."
"Taichi, you treat me better anyway."

[Kiri]
"?!"

That one got her.

[Miki]
"If you're my friend treat me with respect.
Why are you trying to cause trouble?"

[Kiri]
"But, but..."

[Miki]
"Apologize to Taichi."

Kiri ground her teeth.
She was quite frustrated.
She glared at me.

[Kiri]
"Who made you queen...?!"

[Miki]
"HEY!!"

Kiri turned on her heels and ran off.

[Miki]
"Wow, she ran away..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, she's fast."

The two of us watched as Kiri disappeared from
sight.

[Taichi]
"By the way, Miki."

[Miki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Have you grown...?"

[Miki]
"Have I? I can't tell."

Of course.

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, and it seems like your chest has too..."

[Miki]
"No way, don't touch this dancing girl."

She covered her chest with her arms.

[Taichi]
"Psh."

Whatever.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, looks like it's just about time to head
home."

[Miki]
"Shall we go home? Kiri already went home alone."

[Taichi]
"Why don't you go after her? It's not like she wants
to see me."

[Miki]
"All right."

Miki was strong.
I didn't think she was the type to remain calm in a
situation like this.
In times of crisis, a person's true value shined
through.
