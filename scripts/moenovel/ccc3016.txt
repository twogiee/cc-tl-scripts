[Misato]
*yawn*

Misato came.

[Taichi]
"Oh, Misato."

I greeted her from on top of the ladder.

[Kiri]
"Hey."

[Misato]
"Phew..."

[Taichi]
"How about some actual words?"
"You're just spitting out sounds."
"Maybe speak more lady-like. Start with a greeting
and so on."

[Misato]
"What do you expect? Poetry?"

She looked annoyed.

[Taichi]
"Yikes, I know."

[Misato]
"I like poetry though."

[Taichi]
"Study the past to know the future?"

[Misato]
"What're you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway...welcome back from the hospital."

[Misato]
"Thanks, it wasn't anything serious."

[Taichi]
"It doesn't hurt?"

[Misato]
"Nope, I'm fine."

She stared at me.
I stared back at her beautiful breasts.

[Misato]
"Ah, um, so what's with the antenna?"

She asked, hiding her chest with her arms.

[Taichi]
"Just a whim."

[Misato]
"A whim?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, a whim."

[Misato]
"Hmm..."

She looked unhappy.

[Taichi]
"I, a vision of health, want to lead a
positive life."
"And sometime soon, I want to become a young
perverted adult who can distinguish bitter from
sweet."

[Misato]
"A young perverted adult?"

That triggered her to hide her chest further.
I was jealous of her.
She could touch her chest all she wanted.

[Taichi]
"I didn't mean it that way!"

Kiri sighed on the other side of the antenna.

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, I have a lot of questions."

I took out the blueprints.

[Taichi]
"I don't understand this note here."

[Kiri]
"When you're done, I have questions too."

[Misato]
"Y-yeah..."

[Taichi]
"Also, what about the battery?"

[Misato]
"Oh, thought we'd take it from the car parked at the
school."

[Taichi]
"That's a man's job. I'll have Sakuraba do it."

[Misato]
"Only if you can get him to help..."

[Taichi]
"He'll help if I ask, probably."
"He is pretty carefree, that's all."

[Misato]
"No, I don't mean that..."

I knew what she meant.
This club was her personal escape.
Even if everyone helped, she wouldn't be satisfied.
She'd prefer it to last forever.
To be indefinitely devoted.

[Taichi]
"Misato, if we complete this and send an SOS that's
the end, right?"

[Misato]
"Yeah, I guess..."

The end of her escape too.
That was why she wanted to work alone.
So it wouldn't end.

[Taichi]
"Only if we get a reply to our SOS."

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"There's also the directional problems..."
"We'll use a handy radio on top of FM waves, right?"

[Misato]
"Right..."

[Taichi]
"Means we also have to think about reception."

[Misato]
"Oh yeah, right..."

[Taichi]
"Just like a broadcast station, huh?"
"We'll have to emit it until we get a reply."

[Misato]
"Oh..."

[Taichi]
"We'll be so busy."

[Misato]
"..."

She was turning red.

[Misato]
"Yeah, that's for certain."
"Yeah, that could be the case..."
"It's good to be busy, right?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed."
"So it'll be more fun if everyone pitches in."
"We can finish in a day with three people, right?"

[Kiri]
"That's hard for me. I don't get this at all."

[Taichi]
"Yeah. If only there was a mechanically savvy
cutie here."

[Misato]
"Why does it have to be a cutie...?"

With perfect timing someone else came rushing up.

[Miki]
"Is Kiri here?"

Upon opening the door, there was Miki.

[Taichi]
"Bingo!"

[Misato]
"Huh... What's up?"

We informed her of the situation.

[Miki]
"Phew, you're doing some wholesome thing here."

[Taichi]
"We need your high-tech know-how."

[Miki]
"I understand computers. But radios? I don't."

[Taichi]
"But your grades are good."

[Miki]
"I can't help with anything specific though."

[Taichi]
"But you understand difficult textbooks."

[Miki]
"No. Nononono..."
"Even though I want to help..."

I glanced at Kiri.

[Miki]
"Kiri is here too."

[Kiri]
"Sorry..."

[Miki]
"Why are you sorry... I was just surprised."
"So Kiri, what are you going to do about THAT?"

[Kiri]
"Sorry..."

[Miki]
"Suspend it?"

[Kiri]
"Well... Um... Some things came up."

[Taichi]
"What about THAT?"

THAT? Like a girl's "That"?
THAT secret.

[Miki]
"What things came up?"

[Kiri]
"Sorry, I can't talk about that here."

They didn't want me to know.

[Miki]
"Hmm, then..."
"Meow..."

She just meowed.

[Kiri]
"Meow..."

[Miki]
"Meow meow meow."

[Kiri]
"Purrr."

[Misato]
"C-cat talk?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I gathered..."

It creeped us out.
Not minding the two of us who were freaked out,
they continued to meow.
Soon after.

[Miki]
"I see. That happened, huh?"

They complied.

[Taichi]
"So, that made sense?"

Kids these days had their own lingo.

[Miki]
"All right, all right. It's like even when you found
a new country, there will be no soldiers to protect
it."

[Kiri]
"Yeah. Even so, it's impossible..."

[Miki]
"So we have to arm ourselves?"

Sounded like a certain country...

[Taichi]
"I assume that it's a conversation where I am
involved..."
"Miki, you also have a knife, right? You should
probably get rid of it."

[Miki]
"It's convinient to have it with me though."

[Kiri]
"So you do carry a knife?"

[Miki]
"Meow."

[Kiri]
"Oh, sorry."

[Taichi]
"How useful that is."

What kind of grammar did they use?

[Miki]
"I can use it for everyday things."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, just don't give it to Kiri, okay?"

[Miki]
"Sure. That's okay."
"Wow, if you're reconciling with Kiri, the world is
really over."

[Kiri]
"We haven't reconciled."

[Taichi]
"So it seems..."

[Miki]
"Hmph."
"Can I have a moment with you, Taichi?"

She took my hand and pulled me away from the
antenna.
Away from where Kiri could hear.

[Taichi]
"So...?"

[Miki]
"So I understand the situation substantially."

That cat talk was really something.

[Miki]
"Taichi, are you okay with that?"

[Taichi]
"Okay with what?"

I didn't get Miki's question.

[Miki]
"I mean, Kiri doesn't really like...you."

[Taichi]
"I know that already so just spit it out."

[Miki]
"Ahaha...well."

She gave a bitter smile.

[Miki]
"We were actually thinking about living on our own."

[Taichi]
"Huh? Why?"

[Miki]
"Kiri didn't really trust people, and in such a
dangerous situation, she didn't feel safe with
you around."

Wow, Kiri saw right through me.

[Miki]
"So...about you..."

[Taichi]
"She was thinking of me as a potential enemy?"

[Miki]
"Yeah..."

I gave up.

[Miki]
"She won't say how and when it turned out to be
like this."

[Taichi]
"I guess."

[Miki]
"I think she's having a nervous breakdown."
"Do you think you could get along with Kiri
in that state?"

She asked worriedly.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I promised to be on good terms with Kiri,
and made Youko stay away from her."

[Miki]
"Do you think Youko will hurt you?"

[Taichi]
"Well, she just appears out of nowhere."

[Miki]
"Like a superhero, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. I'm the heroine."

[Miki]
"I bet, you have that look."

[Taichi]
"I've never had any good memories, though..."
"Got afraid, pushed down, deceived."

[Miki]
"I suppose, yeah..."

[Taichi]
"There was even a time where I didn't want to see
or speak to anyone."

[Miki]
"You're the opposite of that now."

[Taichi]
"Because I have to."

[Miki]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Because I need to..."
"Like food. Even if you don't like it, you have to
eat it."
"Whatever is going on in your heart,
you've still got to eat."
"I've always believed that because of my face,
especially my eyes for some reason, people think
nasty things about me."

[Miki]
"Your eyes?"

[Taichi]
"My eyes are different from others... Well, even my
facial features are different..."

[Miki]
"Not handsome, but your face is pretty."

[Taichi]
"Everybody says that."

[Miki]
"So that's your emotional scar, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Hm, it's just an additional thing, but really..."

Hey hey, stop there, self.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, it's a deal. I got Youko out of the
picture, and in exchange, Kiri must stay powerless."

[Miki]
"You just skipped a story!"

[Taichi]
"So let me borrow Kiri for a while."

[Miki]
"Hey... Don't tease her too much. I'm worried."

[Taichi]
"I'll be on my best behavior..."

[Miki]
"Well then, I'll accompany you."

And like that.
Miki joined me.
