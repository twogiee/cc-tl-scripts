Mimi was fast asleep.

[Taichi]
"Hello?"

[Misato]
"Hmmm...?"

[Taichi]
"Good morning. Time to wake up. This is Taichi."

[Misato]
"Oh, hey..."

She sluggishly got up.
Hmm, now would be my best chance to see her
panties, right?
I took a knee.
I was a knight at the queen's disposal, though my
motives may have differed.

[Misato]
"Anyway, good morning."

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Misato."
"Won't you get sick from sun exposure,
sleeping here?"

[Misato]
"Oh, yeah, but I'm being careful."

She grabbed the hem of her skirt and wiped her
glasses clean.
Whoa.
She was plump.
She was moderately plump.
But how could my eyes be anywhere other than that
most crucial of sights?
It was like some extraordinary force had control
over my innocent body.
But it's best not to think about it now, I guess.

[Misato]
*yawn*

Misato's skirt drifter back down.
She put her glasses back on.

[Misato]
"I'm still so tired..."

[Taichi]
"Must be an Indian autumn."

[Misato]
"I've never heard that phrase before..."

[Taichi]
"I just made it up."

[Misato]
"You seem to have a knack for creating things,
Pekke."

[Taichi]
"That's very kind of you to say."

[Misato]
"I'm pretty thirsty now."

Misato fished around in her bag.
*roll*

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

A non-alcoholic drink.
Misato was somehow able to get drunk off of these.
Must be some kind of placebo effect.

[Misato]
*gulp gulp*

I quickly snatched the drink from her.

[Misato]
"Ah... What are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Alcohol is against the school rules!"

[Misato]
"My granny's house is a liquor store, it's all
right."

[Taichi]
"No it's not."

[Misato]
"I know that..."

She began to pout.

[Misato]
"But is there really any reason to follow the old
rules?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

[Misato]
"I mean, rules have no meaning when there are no
other people."
"So why do I still have to follow them?"

She scratched her head.

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

[Misato]
"Pekke, why did you come here?"

[Taichi]
"I wanted to see how you were doing."

[Misato]
"Why now, of all times..."

[Taichi]
"Because I love you, Mimi."

[Misato]
"You...say you love...?"

The tip of her nose had turned red. Was it because
of the alcohol?

[Misato]
"Don't say that so easily! The word 'love' is an
important crossroads for a man and a woman!"

She scolded me.

[Taichi]
"I know... But Misato, you're the one who led me
through the darkness all this time."

She was different from the other girls around me.

[Misato]
"That's... I just tried to talk to you that time."

[Taichi]
"Well, beginnings starts off with that, right?"

[Misato]
"Okay, okay! We're not having this discussion!"

She waved her hands emphatically.
No go, huh?

[Taichi]
"We should start dating for our futur-"

[Misato]
"Oh yeah, I have to ask you to make the script!"

She dodged the topic again.

[Taichi]
"Script?"

[Misato]
"Yep, I want you to write a clear, precise, cheerful
and energetic transcript for the first broadcast!"

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

Well then, back to the first objective.

[Taichi]
"All right."

After all, all the information was written in the
notebooks.
I didn't need to make a new one.
