[Miki]
"Um... This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club.
The name of the show is... Oh yeah, right..."
"It's the Miki Miki Channel!"
"Everybody is gone... Nobody is here...
Mooooom."

I woke up on Monday and Mom still hadn't returned.
The neighbors, my community, the townspeople,
all still gone.

[Miki]
"Everyone really has disappeared..."

Yesterday passed in a panic. After sleeping I was
calmer, but today was even scarier.
It was the same old town just without people...
It was strange...and made me feel discouraged...

[Miki]
*sniffle sniffle*
"Everyone! Where is everyone?"

I headed towards school sobbing.
If I went there...Kiri, Taichi, and everyone else
should be there!
Yay! There's Taichi!

[Miki]
"Whahaaaa! Taaaiiichiii!"

My chest felt like it was about to burst
with happiness.
But...

[Miki]
"Tai...chi?"

Something wasn't right? His eyes were vacant.

[Taichi]
"Blood... Blood..."

I noticed the hallway was covered in blood.

[Miki]
"Eek!"

The dark red blood was everywhere.
It looked like someone was murdered here...
There were hand and foot prints...

[Miki]
"This... Why? Taichi, what-"

[Taichi]
*sob*

[Miki]
"Taichi! Pull yourself together!"

[Taichi]
"Red...blood... I must clean it... I'll do it...
Before it happens to me..."

[Miki]
"Tai...chi?"

Taichi stared at nothing muttering incoherently...

[Miki]
"Taichi, Taichi! What's wrong with you?"

[Taichi]
"Hahhh..."

Taichi noticed me and...
He fixed his eyes on me.

[Taichi]
"You're...still here! It's not over!"

I felt so scared...
Taichi reached out with his bloody hands.

[Miki]
"Eek...!"

I stood still, petrified with fear.

[Kiri]
"Miki!"

[Miki]
"Kiri?!"

[Kiri]
"You...monster! What are you doing to Miki..."

Kiri came to my rescue and flew at Taichi.
It happened in an instant.
There was a dull snap... Soon after, Kiri's body
slumped over.
Taichi's arms were around Kiri's thin neck.
Her body swung underneath...

[Miki]
"AAAAAHHHH!!"

I ran away screaming.
I didn't remember much after that.
I think I hid somewhere in a classroom.
Sitting there shaking I heard a scream... I looked
outside and Misato had fallen out a window.
Blood spread out on the ground.

[Miki]
"Oh...my...g- Misato...!"

My nose ran and tears streamed down my face.
I heard Tomoki and Sakuraba scream in the distance.
Was this also Taichi's doing? What was happening?
What was going to happen to me?
Kiri... Misato... Was I next? Would he kill me?
The thought frightened me and I wanted to escape...
But my legs were shaking so bad that I couldn't take
a single step...
I willed myself to the stairs and I heard footsteps!
I scrambled into a downstairs classroom
and Touko was in there.

[Miki]
"Touko! Taichi has gone nuts..."

[Touko]
"..."

Touko stared outside and didn't move a muscle.

[Miki]
"Touko! Touko!"

In a panic I shook her and saw that her throat had
been cut.

[Miki]
"...AAAH!"

I clenched my butt and edged backwards shaking.
No time to think, just run run run...
I made it back home, locked the door, and crawled
into bed shaking and crying...
I finally stopped crying but soon became afraid
again...
Because he knew where I lived.
He'd find my apartment...
The thought drove me out of my place.
Food, drinks, a blanket... I packed the essentials
in a bag.
But I had no place to go.
I was too afraid to go into someone else's house.

[Miki]
"Oh... Ah..."

I couldn't think straight and walked while sobbing.
I just wanted to go far away.
I wanted to distance myself from that terrible
school.
The sun started to go down when I entered the
mountain path...
Everything grew darker all around me.

[Miki]
"Oh no... I hate the dark... It's scary."

I heard the trees shaking each time the wind blew.
And each time it startled me...

[Miki]
"I can't... I don't like this...I want to go home..."

I curled into a ball and cried.
I forced myself to walk some more and came across a
small shrine.
There was no wind and it was very quiet.
Completely different from other places...
Maybe here...
Maybe because of the air of divinity I was able to
relax and soon went to sleep.

[Miki]
*yawn*

The next morning I woke up and stretched.
Owowowow... My body was sore...
But I felt less fearful and uneasy.

[Miki]
"God of this shrine, thank you."

I prayed to show my gratitude.
I didn't know if I was doing it right.

[Miki]
"Hm? What's that...?"

I didn't notice yesterday because it was dark
but there were a number of books in the shrine.

[Miki]
"An object of worship...or whatever?"

The words treasure and cultural asset
flashed through my mind.

[Miki]
"Notebooks...?"

They were just normal school notebooks
scattered about.
I opened one of the notebooks and it was full of
hard to read male handwriting.

[Miki]
"September 7th, Monday?"

That was yesterday.

[Miki]
"Touko? Misato? Miki...!"

My name was written along with theirs!

[Miki]
"Could this be...Taichi's journal?"

Frightened, I threw the notebook away
and jumped back.

[Miki]
"Why? Why?"

Taichi's eyes from yesterday flashed through my
mind.
Then I remembered what happened to Kiri...and
Misato...and Touko...

[Miki]
"Ugh..."

I began to feel nauseous and shook uncontrollably.
I stood in place for a while.
I left the shrine and rested.
I drank the vegetable juice and ate the bread
I brought from home.
I ate some snacks to make myself feel better.
And then...I thought deeply.
I decided to read his journal again.
I wouldn't be able to sleep in the same place these
creepy notebooks were.
I picked up the notebook I threw away
and read it again.
It was a journal that recorded Monday through Friday.
The journal talked about going to school, classes
being canceled, teasing Touko and Misato, and even
harassing me! This must have been written by Taichi.
But this didn't make sense.
They weren't around anymore.
Kiri, Touko, Misato... Probably Tomoki also...
It felt as if I had been stabbed in the chest
so I stopped thinking about it.
I read the journal again.
The journal made him seem kind and funny... A little
weird and very pervy... That was the Taichi I knew.
Strange. I didn't understand.
He was completely crazy yesterday but the journal
read like he led a normal week.

[Miki]
"I wish this were true..."

I read some other notebooks.

[Miki]
"This can't be... How...?"

They were all journals.
They were all the same week!
The contents were only slightly different...
Getting close with Misato and getting back together
with Touko. Kiri and myself too...

[Miki]
"Taichi... Is he delusional?"

Did he dream up some wonderful life
and let his imagination run wild?
Maybe this was how he wished his life to be and left
them at the shrine hoping it would come true.
I laughed a little because it seemed like something
he'd do.
A kind and merry Taichi.
But that person...
I cried a little.
But that happy feeling vanished when I read the next
journal.
Touko had starved to death, there was quarreling
among the club members, Kiri was on the attack...
From Wednesday, gloomy things had been written down.
What were these delusions?
This was so unlike him...
In the next journal I was dead.
The fence broke when we were all playing on the
rooftop...
How awful...
It was an accident but Kiri blamed Taichi. Fearing
what Kiri might do Youko...some terrible things were
written.
Why would he write down these hypothetical
situations?
They made me uneasy.
I read the rest of the journals.
Were these predictions? Was it foresight?
Were they delusions? Was he insane?
Was this Taichi's world?
Every day since, I read the journals over and over
again.
I was afraid to leave this place.
I was afraid if I went back to town he'd find me.
I didn't have the courage to walk to the next town
over.
Exactly a week had passed...since that day.

[Miki]
"I can't take it anymore..."

All the food and drinks I brought were gone.
I had nothing to eat since yesterday.

[Miki]
"I'm afraid but...I have to go into town..."

It was a battle between fear and hunger,
but hunger prevailed.
I stood up.
I lost consciousness and staggered.

[Miki]
"An anemic attack...?"

My head spun.
What was more surprising was...how strange the sky
was.
Like a movie in fast forward, the clouds sped
overhead and the sun went down in an instant.

[Miki]
"It's already evening?"

Weird. What was happening...?
The evening sun went down quickly...
It was dark all around...
And... And...
...
I lost consciousness.
The blue sky spread out.
A refreshing wind blew.
The morning light was bright.
Morning sun...?
It was noon, then evening, then the sun went down...
Now morning?
My sense of time was warped.

[Miki]
"Have I gone...a bit mad...?"

Did the world go mad or did I?
I just didn't know.
But there was one thing that was clear.
I was starving. I was so hungry.
I went into town cautiously, and then snuck into
Tazaki Mart.
I downed my favorite vegetable juice, Healthy GoGo.

[Miki]
"It's been a week... It really sinks in..."

At that moment.
I saw a terrifying person.
My heart almost jumped out of my chest.

[Touko]
"Oh...!"

[Miki]
"T-Touko?!"

I stared at her little throat.
There was no sign of a cut.

[Miki]
"You're...alive?!"

[Touko]
"Huh? Do you not want to see me?"
"Hmph..."

[Miki]
"Ah... Um..."

How? Was it a dream?
Or was this a hallucination?
I hurried after Touko.

[Miki]
"Touko...?"

[Touko]
"What...?"

[Miki]
"Um... You're really early."

[Touko]
"It's the opening ceremony of the new school term..."

[Miki]
"Huh?!"

[Touko]
"Of course not. There's just nothing to do at home."

[Miki]
"Um... Today..."

[Touko]
"If you don't have anything to say just go."

She drove me off in a really bad mood.
But... How... If that was the case...

[Miki]
"Kiri!!"

Kiri was in the classroom.
She was looking out into the distance sadly.
The same old Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Miki...?"

She was alive. She was moving.

[Miki]
"Oh... Thank God."

I embraced Kiri.
My thin, frail, and soft Kiri.
Her smell. Her warmth.
I felt her with my whole body...

[Miki]
*sob sob*

[Kiri]
"What's wrong? Don't cry. What happened?"

[Miki]
"Kiri... Weren't you hurt?"

[Kiri]
"I'm fine. I'll always be here."

[Miki]
"But... But..."

I cried into Kiri's chest.

[Kiri]
"It's scary being alone isn't it?"

[Miki]
"Yeah... Yeah..."

I was sad and alone all week. I felt like dying.

[Kiri]
"It's only been one night..."

Huh...?
Something was odd.
Touko also talked about the opening ceremony.

[Miki]
"Kiri, what day is it?"

[Kiri]
"Today is the ceremony, so September 7th."

Last week?!
So...time had...
Um... A time machine?
No, not that.
What was it? Time stop? Slip? Strip?
Time leap? Warp?
The time skipping thing that happens
in comics, cartoons, and movies.

[Miki]
"Is that true?"

[Kiri]
"It's definitely September 7th... What's up?"

She wasn't lying.
I mean, Kiri was alive.
Still alive...
And then Taichi...

[Miki]
"Oh no! Run!"

[Kiri]
"What's wrong?"

[Miki]
"Kiri don't move. Stay here until I return."

[Kiri]
"Uh, okay..."

It seemed endless...
I did my best to wipe the blood off the floor.
The water in the bucket was dark red.
I changed the water and cleaned so many times...
But the floor remained stained with blood.

[Miki]
"It won't come out... AAAAAHHH!"

Someone patted me on the butt.

[Taichi]
"Do you have some chronic disease?
Shall I give you a back rub?"

[Miki]
"You're already touching me and that's not my back."

[Taichi]
"Oops. Hahahah."

Typical Taichi.

[Miki]
"Unh..."

Tears started to flow.

[Taichi]
"Oh, oh no no no... I'm sorry. You really didn't
like that."

[Miki]
"It's not that..."

It really was him.

[Miki]
"I'm glad... I'm just glad. Everything is normal..."

[Taichi]
"If if if if I make you so happy... I'll get weird!"

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Ah ha!"

He lifted my skirt!

[Taichi]
"Ya hah!"

He came at me again!
He touched my breasts!

[Taichi]
"Yup, no change... Still flat."

And he insulted me on top of that!
I built up my strength...

[Miki]
"Uuurrraaaah!"

He dodged my fist of fury so easily.

[Taichi]
"That's not good enough to get the prince's
autograph."

[Miki]
"Prince? Prince Perv?"

[Taichi]
"Wait! I object! I'm authorized to lightly harass.
They all like the prince's actions... Bring on the
testimonies!"

[Miki]
"No thanks."

[Taichi]
"This is a violation, let me see your license."

[Miki]
"My license...?"

He already had a pen in hand... He really wanted to
give a signature.
I searched for my handbook.

[Taichi]
"You don't have any signatures. I'll fill it up."

He scribbled all over the pages.
He wanted me to fill my notebook with signatures?
As he returned my book, he asked a question.

[Taichi]
"What are you doing by the way?"

[Miki]
"Cleaning."

[Taichi]
"Oh, what does the student rep say when sending off
the graduates..."

[Miki]
"A farewell letter?"

[Taichi]
"A diagram problem I learned a long time ago..."

[Miki]
"Proof! QED! Confirmed!"

[Taichi]
"Don't act stupid!"
"Dang... You're no good at ad lib."

He dramatically crouched down and curled up.
It was kinda...cute.

[Taichi]
"AHAAAAAAANNNNN!!!"

Now an exaggerated surprise.
He was acting like a child, so I tried to calm him.

[Taichi]
"Blood... Blood! It's Blood!"

He noticed the red water in the bucket
and started to shake.

[Miki]
"Taichi! Calm down!"

I hunched over his body so that he couldn't see the
blood.

[Taichi]
"Where are we...?"

[Miki]
"The nurse's office. You passed out
so I brought you here."

[Taichi]
"Oh... That must've been hard."

[Miki]
"Don't worry about it..."

It was better than watching him act even weirder.

[Taichi]
"It's embarrassing, but I can't stand blood..."

[Miki]
"Never mind. I'll take care of you!"

I had to watch over Taichi from now on.
My time leap, warp, travel or whatever
must have happened so I could do this.
To stop him from seeing blood. I guess fate brought
me back...
Anyway!
He was back to his usual kind self.
I decided to be content with that for now.

[Miki]
"Hm...?"

[Kiri]
"...Why were you with Taichi yesterday?"

[Miki]
"Sorry, he lost consciousness..."

[Kiri]
"So...you went home together?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, I was worried."

[Kiri]
"That's dangerous. Stay away from him..."

[Miki]
"But..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi...is a murderer."

[Miki]
"How...? How did you know that?"

What followed was a blur.
The next day, Touko fell at school.
Kiri said it was Taichi's fault.
Tomoki said it was Misato...
Everyone fought around Touko who was sleeping in
the nurse's office.
Kiri took out a knife and attacked
indiscriminately...
I tried to stop her but she stabbed at me.
I blacked out...
Next thing I knew the nurse's office
was covered in blood.
I stumbled out of the school.
I was scared and wanted to run away,
but I was in a daze.
I could hardly move as if my mind
and body were no longer connected.
I heard Taichi in the distance.
A howling cry echoed from the rooftop.

[Taichi]
"AWOOOOOOOO! AAAAAAAAAAAH!"

It sounded like a sad beast howling out.
His voice shocked me so I ran at full speed.
I arrived at my safe place.
I felt better. I could sleep here.
I felt like if I was here I'd return to the previous
week.
If that happens...I could try over and over again.
Since it'd be my second time, I'd know what to do.
I returned to get food and water.
It was far from the school.
I got a cushion also.
I read Taichi's journals repeatedly over the days
until Sunday came.
It was the same week but things were different.
I couldn't understand why his journals were here.
But Taichi...we kept repeating the same week.
I held the journal tight against my chest.
And then...Sunday came.

[Miki]
"The sunset is pretty..."

The strange time phenomenon occurred once again.
The week rewound and looped.
A straight line twisted and was made into a ring.
It just kept going in circles.
But I felt like this time would go better.
And so...the morning sun came up and I went about my
business.
I'd know what to expect.

[Miki]
"All right, the new term begins today."

I briskly made my way to school.
But I couldn't forget to stop by Tazaki Mart.
Healthy GoGo! I must GoGo!
Then I remembered that things kept looping.

[Miki]
"A routine is important!"

One time when I didn't buy the juice,
things got messed up.
Taichi was withdrawn from the world.
Touko dominated. Tomoki promoted life support
through his club. A regime started to form...
Luckily Youko and Sakuraba's coup d'etat
ended without any trouble.
It would be a nightmare to rethink it all now.
I didn't get it.
Especially the first day... Mondays were a little
uneasy, so everyone went nuts over trivial things.
Well what should I do now?

[Miki]
"Morning Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Morning Miki."

A casual morning greeting.
It felt nice.
We went to the classroom together.
It had been a while since we did this.
It had been nothing but miserable endings lately.

[Miki]
"...Oh!"

Taichi stood still in the bloody hallway.
Oh no, it was too late.
I forgot this happened the first day.
The blood from Sakakibara's murder
was still in this world.
If he saw that he would go completely nuts.
If I didn't clean it, the ceremony couldn't start!
If that was the case...

[Kiri]
"Taichi! I knew you..."

That's right. Kiri lost control too.

[Miki]
"Kiri, wait! Taichi, I'll..."

[Kiri]
"Run Miki!"

I couldn't stop here. It was too late.
They fought it out and I ran away.
Kiri didn't have her knife.
After having trouble with Taichi, Kiri armed
herself.
She armed herself with a crossbow and practiced
every night to fight Taichi.
Even then, she usually lost.
I didn't want to watch her suffer.
Enough was enough.
I spent the rest of the week at the shrine.
Until next week, this was Miki!
The morning sun came up and I went about my
business.
Today was the ceremony. It was the beginning of
the week.
I cleaned everything up.
It was a weekly thing.
Soon Taichi would touch my butt.

[Taichi]
"Hey babe!"

I dodged him quickly.

[Miki]
"Hahah! I've gotten better at this!"

[Taichi]
"I can see your panties."

[Miki]
"Huh? Ah..."

I quickly fixed my skirt.

[Miki]
"My skirt isn't even hiked up."

[Taichi]
"You're right. Let's hike it up."

[Miki]
"STOOOP. Stop, please."

He accidentally touched my breast
in the struggle...

[Taichi]
"Oh no, stop it!"

[Miki]
"H-hey that's my line isn't it?"

[Taichi]
"It's all yours. Go ahead babe."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Even so... I can see you've gotten better."

[Miki]
"Yeah, but don't squeeze my hand
while you say it. Pervert, pervy perv!"

[Taichi]
"Pervy perv?"

[Miki]
"Perversion within perversion."

[Taichi]
"Not bad. You thought of it before me."

[Miki]
"It happens."

Because it was in your journal.
Youko found it and took it away though.
Even so, I remembered the weird expression.

[Miki]
"How about a signature?"

[Taichi]
"How sexy that you're asking for it..."

[Miki]
"I don't really want it."

[Taichi]
"Don't pretend."

He scribbled quickly.

[Taichi]
"You wanted it so bad didn't you?"

[Miki]
"Yeah I need to fill it up."

A different Taichi every week.
He seemed the same but always different.
Weekly Taichi...
I collected supplemental signatures.
I've got so many memories of him in my notebook.
Nobody knew about my collection.
I wondered what kind of memory he'd create this
week...
I saw him off to the club while I thought.

[Miki]
"Um... This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club.
The name of the show is... Oh yeah, right..."
"The Miki Miki Channel! Yay yay yay!"
"It's kinda quiet... Is there anybody out there?"
"Everyone here is dead. Heheh..."
"And so I am broadcasting from the incomplete
antenna."
"It went well for a while. Everyone pitched in and
fixed it..."
"Taichi and Kiri managed not to fight. Misato found
Tomoki about to break the antenna."
"It was a mess... Taichi and Youko passed after that
so this is a commemoration broadcast."
"So, Taichi, I'm sorry. I don't hate you."
"I gave Kiri the crossbow because sometimes you
challenge her and it turns into a fight to the
death... Also sometimes you lose control."
"I have no choice, it's so I can survive...
I cherish your signatures."
"Don't worry. I will always be me. Every week, I
will remain strong."
"I will fill it up with all of your signatures."
"It's almost that time. I've got to get back to the
shrine. No time for more broadcasts!"
"Until next week! This has been the Miki Miki
Channel!"
