I couldn't seem to open the door.
So I pushed a bit harder, and when it opened I was
hit by a strong gust of wind.
There was a wind tunnel.
My ears rang.
And there stood Misato.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"Oh, good morning."

[Taichi]
"How's the antenna coming along?"

[Misato]
"I guess it's getting there, little by little."

[Taichi]
"It's scheduled until next Sunday, right?"

[Misato]
"You've got that day pretty well memorized."

[Taichi]
"Just in case."

[Misato]
"Well, you're right. If nothing happens after all
our work, I..."
"But there's no one left, so it really might have no
effect at all... Ah, sorry."

[Taichi]
"It's all right."

There really was no need to apologize.
It wasn't as if her words had hurt me.

[Taichi]
"Well, the rooftop was closed off for that reason."

[Misato]
"So I guess you're taking some liberties being here
now."

[Taichi]
"That makes both of us, Misato."

We faced one another, and smiled simultaneously.

[Misato]
"So we're both suspended from school. Sort of like
we got yellow cards."

[Taichi]
"Them's the breaks."
"Anyhow, did you work on it all by yourself,
Misato?"

[Misato]
"I had a diagram, but more or less, yes."
"But it was really difficult. There was even a time
where it was all disassembled by someone."

Even still, Misato didn't asked for any help.
She had carried on under the sun, by herself,
without burdening anyone else.

[Taichi]
"At this point, offering any help would be a
self-serving gesture."

She smiled.

[Misato]
"Thank you."
"But your thoughts are enough."

Well, that's the kind of person she was.

[Taichi]
"You can count on me whenever you need help, just
remember that."

Use me as your escape, please.

[Misato]
"Oh, it's fine. I'm fine."
"I won't say 'instead of helping me,' but why don't
we have some tea together next time?"

[Taichi]
"Sure."
