On the way back from the toilet.
I came across Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki!!"

[Tomoki]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hahah, I skipped class. The halls feel like a
strange world when classes are going on."

[Tomoki]
"Stop wasting time..."

Tomoki looked miserable.

[Taichi]
"We're here, thanks to the fact
that we're loafing around like this."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi, you're so free-spirited."
"We won't be able to read the rest of 'Psychoman.'"

Bitter laughter.

[Taichi]
"Oh, right..."

I couldn't spoil the plot for Tomoki, anymore.

[Tomoki]
"So, what are you doing at school?"

[Taichi]
"I, who holds the license of innocence..."
"Want to portray the fragile minds of teens by
depicting the emptiness and automation of our
everyday habits like going to school."

[Tomoki]
"It's a thought you can get when your imagination
runs wild in your teens."
"There are still lots of hot-blooded baseball kids
out there, you know?"

[Taichi]
"Well, they aren't regarded as having any
observational value, when we go on talking about
post-modernism."

I waved my hands about.

[Tomoki]
"Hahahah, you could say that."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, right?"

Black comedy.
I liked Tomoki for his blunt criticism.

[Tomoki]
"I haven't laughed like that in a while.
Thanks Taichi."

[Taichi]
"I'm glad I was of help"
"How's the club going lately?"

[Tomoki]
"Pretty smoothly, since the King of Snitching Food
isn't taking part."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah..."

He was talking about me.

[Tomoki]
"I think your place will be tomorrow."

[Taichi]
"Okay. Thanks."

[Tomoki]
"All good."
"Friendship is..."

[Taichi]
"Not asking anything in return."

With sweaty smiles and a wide grin, we gave each
other a thumbs-up.

[Tomoki]
"Speaking of which..."
"Have you been participating in the club lately?"

[Taichi]
"I got rejected by you from taking part because, I'm
the King of Snitching Food."

[Tomoki]
"No, not that club."

He momentarily hesitated.

[Tomoki]
"The one on the rooftop..."

[Taichi]
"Ohh, you mean Mimimi's?"
"Umm, I haven't gone in a while.
A lot has been going on..."

[Tomoki]
"I see..."
"Well, that might actually be better."
"Yep. It's better."

Tomoki turned his back to me and left.
He was acting so weird lately.
I wondered why?
