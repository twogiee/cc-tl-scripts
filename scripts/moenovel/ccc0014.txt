I shrugged.

[Taichi]
"Of course, I didn't come here for nothing."

Kiri's eyes narrowed. She appeared quite perturbed.

[Taichi]
"Is Miki here?"

[Kiri]
"No she isn't."

[Taichi]
"Has she come by at all?"

[Kiri]
"No she hasn't."

She spoke few words, obviously not wanting to engage
in conversation.
I shrugged again.

[Taichi]
"How about throwing me a bone here?"

[Kiri]
"Nope."

I sat in a nearby chair.

[Taichi]
"Man, I'm depressed. With humanity being nearly
extinct and all."

[Kiri]
"..."

She simply stared at me.
She was cautious of my every action.

[Taichi]
"But Miss Innocence..."

[Kiri]
"Don't call people by such ridiculous names."

[Taichi]
"But Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"And don't call me by my first name."

[Taichi]
*sigh*

I shrugged a third time.

[Taichi]
"This is some pretty intense persecution, y'know?"

[Kiri]
"..."

I stood up from my seat.

[Kiri]
"...!"

Her alertness increased.
She began trembling.
She was so friggin' cute.
For a sado-masochist like myself, just looking at
her was incredibly satisfying.

[Taichi]
"Hm-hm..."

[Kiri]
"...?"

I gave a bold smile. One which puzzled Kiri.
Her posture was coiled, it looked as if she would
run away at any moment.
I made only the slightest of movements
as I stood before the chair.

[Taichi]
"This is your spot, right Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"Call me by my proper name..."
"...As someone of your social standing should."

Her words were like a knife.
And she intended to cut me with them over and over.

[Taichi]
"This is your spot, Ms. Sakura."

I slowly moved to sit down.

[Kiri]
"Stop!"

Her scream was like a person at wit's end.
I stopped moving instantly.

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Kiri]
"You'll dirty it..."

She lowered her voice, as if she were ashamed of
others hearing.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm. Can't be helped, I guess."

I sat down.

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"Whoo, it's hot today. I'm sweating like a pig.
The sun's practically cooking me!"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Nothing?"

Kiri's shoulders began to quiver.
Was she that mortified?
She must absolutely hate me.

[Kiri]
"What are you here for?"

I gave her a sweet smile.

[Taichi]
"For your innocence, Miss Innocence."

[Kiri]
"Go home."

[Taichi]
"But I haven't even done anything yet."

[Kiri]
"Do you plan to do anything more?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe..."

I was at a loss.
It would be a shame to stain such pure glass.
I hesitated.

[Taichi]
"All right, I won't."

[Kiri]
"..."

She ignored me.
It was either the silence or the knife with her.

[Taichi]
"Let's just chat a bit."

[Kiri]
"Please go home."

I shrugged a fourth time.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you brought your school supplies with you."

I helped myself to the contents of Kiri's bag.

[Taichi]
"Today's just opening ceremony though. Hahah,
so you're the type who brings all their books
on the first day and leaves them, huh?"

[Kiri]
"Please don't touch my bag, and please don't help
yourself to its contents."

I shrugged my shoulders a fifth time.
She kept making me shrug.
As one would expect from Kiri Sakura.
The girl that I called "Miss Innocence."

[Taichi]
"No matter what I do, it seems to hurt you."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you tired?"

[Kiri]
"And whose fault is that?!"

Her voice trembled with anger.
I was normally blunt, but with humans going extinct
and all...
I think it affected Kiri as well. It was like the
walls of her heart were coming down.

[Taichi]
"It's probably my fault."

I felt a smile creeping across my face.
I shrugged.
I began comically shrugging my shoulders
as fast as I could.

[Kiri]
"Won't you...please leave?"

She was holding it back, but I could tell she was
about to fly into a dangerous rage.

[Taichi]
"All right."

Maybe I had gone too far.
I began to take my leave.

[Taichi]
"Oh, hey, wanna get lunch together?"

Kiri blankly stared at me.

[Taichi]
"I guess not. All right then. Say hi to Miki for
me."

I left the classroom.
