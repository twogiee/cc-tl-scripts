Touko was there.
I mean, she was always the one to arrive first.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Touko]
"Hmph!"

Was she ignoring me?
Was that it?

[Taichi]
"Underwear..."

[Touko]
"Not this again."

[Taichi]
"Could you buy me some underwear?"

[Touko]
"Why do I have to buy you underwear?!"

She stood up and left her desk.

[Taichi]
"The morning's just started and you're already
so hot."

I gave her a thumbs-up.

[Touko]
"..."

She grabbed my thumb and jerked it to the side as if
to break it.

[Taichi]
"Gyaaaooo!"
"Idiot! What are you gonna do if you break it?"

I shouted.
I'm glad I pulled my hand back so fast.

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me."

[Taichi]
"Did you watch TV yesterday?"

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me!"

[Taichi]
"Hmph..."

It just made you want to talk more when 
someone harshly tells you not to.
And when you speak, again, they harshly tell 
you not to talk to them.
