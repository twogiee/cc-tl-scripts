"Taichi!"

I heard the voice from behind me.

[Taichi]
"Hey!"
"Are you finished cleaning?"

Miki looked startled.

[Miki]
"Y-you know that I was cleaning..."
"Have you been watching me doing the work?"

Crap.
Journal entry. Top-secret.

[Taichi]
"Perhaps I don't need to keep it a secret..."

[Miki]
"What secret?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, nothing, just talking to myself."

No, I'd best cover it up for now.
If I recall correctly, I did some sexual harassment.
I must be really worked up...
But... Oh well.
