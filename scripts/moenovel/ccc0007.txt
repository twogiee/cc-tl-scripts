The shrine...huh.
It sapped my will to go to school.
It wasn't like there was much I could do there
anyway.
I believed that people possessed countless
potential.
But for most people, that potential is suppressed by
their own idiosyncrasies.
In general, people chose to do what everyone else
did.
However...
They say if you repeated an event a hundred times,
there was a probability of an erratic outcome.
That's what I believed, anyway.
I intended to make my own erratic outcome.
That said, I used this route the other day too.
Along with my despair.
Climbing this mountain once more.
Looking for the shrine.
I had no goal in mind.
Or rather, simply going there was my goal.
That girl... Nanaca, was it?
She had pointed me to this place.
Maybe I could find what I was looking for...
There were no signs of anyone being here for a long
time.
The path to the shrine was covered in grass. It was
hard going.
But I trusted my instincts and continued forward.
And in no time...

[Taichi]
"There it is."

I spoke to myself.
As I came closer to the shrine, everything became
silent. The sounds of humans, animals, and the world
completely disappeared.
It was as if the shrine was wrapped in silence
itself.
A solemn atmosphere.
Even the temperature felt colder.
I suddenly felt nervous, my throat became dry and
tight.
I felt as if I shouldn't make a single sound.
I approached the shrine.

[Taichi]
"..."

There was an obvious strangeness to it.
But what?
I couldn't put my finger on it.
This place was downright eerie.
Every sense in my body was telling me that someone
else was here. A presence.
And though it was strange, the presence didn't feel
dangerous.
I thoroughly scanned the grounds.
The shrine was set at the top of a tall flight of
stairs.
There was a set of double doors.
They were sealed shut by sacred rope.
I had to see what was inside.
It could possibly be some strange monster
sealed away within.
Hmmm, probably not..
It wasn't like anything like that existed. This
wasn't some RPG or anything.
And so, I placed my hand on the double doors.
And I opened them.

[Taichi]
"What...?"

What I saw took me by surprise.
Within the simple, dimly lit room, there were no
monsters, no traditional vases, no swords, no
crystal balls...
Just a pile of notebooks.
About five.
No, six.
Just a plain old stack of student's notebooks.
It was a complete mismatch with the shrine.
This was really not what I had expected.

[Taichi]
"What gives..."

I didn't had any clue who would have left them here,
but...
I picked up one of the notebooks...
On its binding, I saw a number casually scrawled in
magic marker.
It was a volume label.
I opened the notebook labeled "1" and gave it a look.
...
Monday. 
Today, I went to school, but I skipped classes.
Touko was especially prickly today.
Pssh...
Her being on her period is no excuse to take things
out on others.
"I took out my revenge on her, by writing nasty
things in my diary."
No, don't!
Heheh, you say "no", but your body says "yes."
Ah, no! That's not true! Stop, stop!
Too late! A man can't back out once he has gone this
far! Look at my precious!
No, not my body! Please!
You'll soon want it yourself.
No, have mercy!!
There's no one to hear you, GRAH!!
You monster...!!
Then a close-up shot of a rose in a vase.
The bud of the flower breaks off and falls to the
ground.
And then the screen blurs and fades out. (Fin)
I found Miki cleaning when I was passing through the
hallway.
My fingers came close to touching Miki's butt,
but I was only able to graze it.
She used to be so slow and I used to be able
to touch it as much as I wanted.
We have a major problem, Principal!
But my pupil's improvement made me proud. She may
soon surpass her teacher.
I went to club activities for once, and flirted with
Mimi.
She was the same old soothing type.
Lots of other things happened, but overall it was a
good day.

[Taichi]
"This is..."

It was my journal.
I turned the page.
Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday.
It was most definitely my journal.
But...

[Taichi]
"Something's off..."

I flipped to the next page.
Tuesday.
"Express your emotions!"
"Who first thought of putting curry bread roux on
rice? Sheer genius."
"That question always gets me so bolstered."
"It's like I've been croxxing back and forth on some
path I'd never considered crossing, and my days seem
to conclude in emptiness."
"Baudelaire once said..."
"God is dead."
"Doubt, or the absence of faith and naivete, is a
virtue peculiar to this age, for no one is obedient
nowadays."
"For example, in class, when starting up a fruity
conversation with an obstinate girl."
"Or in the hall, when we meet two friends, one close
and one estranged, at the same time."
"And the two of them have established a friendly
relationship."
"I, to each of them (flow of obscene sentences)."
"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in
silence."
"Those were the famous words of Kierkegaard."
"The neutral beauty of Kiri, and my proper passion
for her, I will now cease talking about."
"That wasn't the only pleasure in my life."
"That's right."
"For the one who I met on the roof, my life's guide,
the lovely, compassionate, and motherly Misato, I
have not enough room in my pages."
"First, her thighs are, to say the least-
(The following sentences are censored.)"
"And in my hands, was the bra that held up her
breasts."
"The scent I breathed in from it sent my mind into a
ravishing fantasy."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-FIN-
It was, without a doubt, written from my usual
perspective.
And yet it was still a bit strange.
If I had written it, I should have remembered it.
It was true that I've written a bit once in a
while...

[Taichi]
"No..."

I had zero memory of ever writing any of this.
I couldn't remember any of it.
And it didn't feel like I had memeory loss or anything.
I had always been the type to remember
even the most insignificant details.
Things like childhood friends, and wedding
reservations...
Even if I was a time-spy cyborg from the future, and
my memory chips were destroyed, I would still be
able to remember.
Yeah, that's how good my recollection was.
But now I couldn't even remember this stuff
happening, let alone writing about it.

[Taichi]
"Wahaha!"

I felt like a delighted soldier, at least before
their country went to ruin anyhow.
All right then.
I continued to read.
Wednesday.
Hmph. Next.
Thursday.
On to Friday.
I went to the ocean today. The same spot that I went
to last year with everyone. It was a lonely
experience this time.
Last year was a bit awkward, but at least it gave me
the sense that we were building towards something,
that we were maintaining contact.
I remember it being nothing but good times. And yet
a mere year later, we've grown so distant, after all
that has happened.
However, that's not the only reason.
We're all damaged in some way...
And now, we're the only people left in this world...
What a cynical composition.
At night, I went to check on Misato.
And I also took the opportunity to check out the
shrine which I remembered that Nanaca told me about.
I'm always much more active at night. It's a strange
predisposition of mine.
I had many questions, but my thoughts were jumbled.
Despite Nanaca's profound suggestion, I found
nothing out of ordinary at the shrine.
Instead, I found a single bit of paper. It was a
note from Youko. The note was brand-new.
It read, "Record everything here."
As always, no explanation was given.
Youko, being a near perfect person, had no need to
talk to others. She became shy, silent and said
little. So little that she was often misunderstood.
But when she did speak, she was never wrong. So I
decided to trust her instructions. I brought my most
recent journal here.
So this will be my last entry.
That was how the first volume ended.
On to the second volume.
The contents were roughly the same.
The entries from Monday onward were uneventful.
All the way up to the Saturday trip to the shrine.
The same with the third volume. And the fourth. And
the fifth.
Each notebook outlined the same events.
There were some small differences in the details.
For example, meeting the Flowers and my interactions
with Mimi and Touko had some discrepancies.
But overall, the week's events were copied
in each notebook to roughly the same effect.
It was as if that time span kept repeating itself...
Given calm consideration, these journals indicated a
number of possibilities.
1: There was another personality within me
writing these journals.
2: I had sent these journals here myself, from the
future.
3: Time was repeating itself.
The first possibility was out of the question.
I could guarantee that.
You couldn't just give a monkey a typewriter
and expect it to recreate Shakespeare.
The second possibility was equally improbable.
That left possibility three...
No matter how improbable, these five journals
gave the indication of a time loop being the cause.
Youko's memo was pressed between the pages
of the first notebook.
The note looked incredibly old.
It looked as if it had been written many years ago.
Record everything, huh?
Well, it was a journal.
So why must I record everything?
The journals had no details written beyond Friday.
The fourth volume was the only one which had
continued on to Saturday.
In other words, something must have been occurring
on Saturday to compel me to begin writing from the
beginning of the week once more.
So the point of restart must be Monday.
Or possibly Sunday.
Maybe I was feeling down on Sunday, so I didn't
record that day.
With so many possibilities, why did I always take the
same actions?
No, wait.

[Taichi]
"The world's repeating?"

That would be astounding.
But at this point...
A sound conclusion would be helpful...
I decided to reflect upon the final destination.
In each of the paths, there was only one outcome.
There seemed to be a large chance that I... No, the
world was repeating the same week over and over.
Let's go with that for now.
Loops tended to follow certain rules.
One of those rules must have been wiping memories of
the week each time.
Considering that there were five journals, that
meant that the world must have 'rewound' at least
five times.
And my memory must have been rewound each time as
well.
That was the conclusion I reached.
That's why I was unable to remember.
Youko was a mental ninja, so she must have been able
to work it out.
And so she left the memo for me.
But why?
Youko's memories must have been rewound as well...
So she must have realized that it was the same for
everyone.
Mimi, Touko, Miki and Kiri, Sakuraba, Tomoki...

[Taichi]
"I see."

I understood the severity of our present condition.
Our memories were being reset.
That was to say...
All the memories that have burdened us so far
would be reset at the end of the week.
Which meant that on the following week (literally),
I would start my Monday with none of these concerns.
And something would guide me back to this shrine...

[Taichi]
"Wow..."

I needed some way to attack this situation,
and I needed it now.
But then I wearily remembered.
There was another rule to the loops.
This shrine was somehow able to escape the 
influence of the loop.
That meant that as long as I was here, subjective
time should be retained.

[Taichi]
"How did you find this out, Youko?"

With the notebooks, it could be understood.
But if she didn't have the notes yet, how did she
first realize the shrine's anomaly?
It wasn't the kind of thing that a normal person
could come to understand.
Then again, Youko was anything but a normal, simple
person.

[Taichi]
"If anyone could figure it out, it would be Youko."

I imagined she must have conducted all sorts of
investigations.

[Taichi]
"Even still..."

I thought upon as I entered the shrine.
It was too narrow.
I would have to contort my body like some sort
of transforming robot in order to fit.
Just what kind of being was that Nanaca girl,
anyway?

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

There wasn't enough evidence to form a proper
theory.
She was cheerful, wore an odd uniform, rode a bike,
had long slender legs and a tight ass, wore slimming
clothes yet still had an above-average bust...

[Taichi]
"Oh no!"

Now was the worst time to...expand.
If I keep this up I won't be able to fit in the shrine!
Actually...my size didn't make any difference.

[Taichi]
"...I guess that's what kind of man I am."

Well, I was in, but moving around was a problem.
It was such a tight fit that it felt like I was
being compacted into a cuboid shape.
And then I tried to close the doors.

[Taichi]
"I did it."

Did what?
