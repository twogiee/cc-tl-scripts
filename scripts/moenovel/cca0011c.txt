The ground was still hot in the evening.
I could feel the heat even through the soles of my
shoes.
Nothing I couldn't handle.
And it was worlds apart from the Kanto city center.
At least here the cool wind helped blow away the
humidity.
If only I didn't have to climb so many hills.
And the cicadas crying made the heat worse.
The summer was their time to go all out. They were
like a summer band...

[Boy]
"Gah!"

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

Somebody had fallen over nearby.
There was a rattle as their steel crutches tumbled
to the ground.

[Taichi]
"Umm?"

A boy was on the ground.
I went closer.

[Taichi]
"Um, are you all right?"

[Boy]
"Ah, I'm sorry. I'm fine."

Japanese people always say they're fine at times
like this.
You could't really know for sure.
His response pissed me off.

[Taichi]
"It's been two seconds! How the hell would you know,
already!"

[Boy]
"O-oh... Uhh."

The Japanese kid was speechless, his head bobbed
back and forth.

[Taichi]
"There could be compound fractures!"

[Boy]
"I think we would be able to tell if that was the
case..."

[Taichi]
"I'll teach you a thing or two about underestimating
humanity!"

[Boy]
"What are you talking about?!"
"Well, anyhow. I'm not hurt."

He stood up with a grimace.
I handed him his crutches.

[Boy]
"Ah, thanks."

[Taichi]
"No worries, it was my fault."
"You hurt?"

[Boy]
"Doesn't look like it."

He used the crutches to balance himself.
It looked as if one of his legs didn't work...

[Taichi]
"Break a bone?"

[Boy]
"If only that was the case."

He had a gentle, carefree smile.
The face of a person who's gone through pain.

[Boy]
"Huh, you... That hair."

[Taichi]
"Oh, this?"

I picked at my own hair.

[Taichi]
"It's not a wig."

[Boy]
"Well, I wasn't saying it was."
"Did you dye it? It's white down to the follicle."

[Taichi]
"Nah. It's natural."

[Boy]
"Ohh."
"It's completely white."

That's right.
My hair had been pure white for a long time now.
Someone had told me once, that it was as white as
cotton.
It wasn't white because of senility.
Glazing snow-white hair.
Eerie natural white.
The number one reason I attracted people's
attention.
The number two reason was probably the difference
between my hair and my face. Dammit.

[Boy]
"Ah, sorry. I hope you didn't take offense to that."

He seemed like a good guy.
He was considerate.
So I did the same.

[Taichi]
"Nope, not at all."
"Hey, so my school is just up ahead."

[Boy]
"Ah... Gunjo Gakuin?"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

[Boy]
"I'm going to be attending there too."

He smiled.

[Taichi]
"Yeah? How old are you?"

He told me his birthday.
We were the same age.
Who knows? Maybe we could be friends?

[Taichi]
"Nice to meet ya."

[Boy]
"Same to you, thanks for all the info."
"One of my legs doesn't move much."

[Taichi]
"Is that so..."

[Boy]
"It's a mental issue. The wound healed a while ago."

[Taichi]
"That's rough. Since when?"

[Boy]
"A while. It was just like that one day, like your
hair."
"See, it's thinner, right?"

He raised his jeans to show me his ankle.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

[Boy]
"I'm losing muscle since it's not being used at all."

[Taichi]
"That's not good, you should exercise."

[Boy]
"It barely moves. I do try and move it by hand
occasionally."
"If I can be bothered."

[Taichi]
"Hey now!"

[Boy]
"Hahaha, just kidding."

[Taichi]
"You're the type to joke at your own misfortune,
huh?"

I couldn't underestimate this guy.

[Boy]
"Something like that."
"I hope I'm going to a nice school."

[Taichi]
"It is."
"Especially for people like us."

[Boy]
"That's great."

[Taichi]
"There are a lot of cute girls, too."

[Boy]
"Really?"

A lot were cute, but a lot of them could barely hold
a conversation...

[Taichi]
"Ms. Machiko is especially good. She's great."

[Boy]
"Even the name is nice. I want to see her so bad
now."

[Taichi]
"I'll show you my secret Ms. Machiko album
next time."
"She's grade A."

[Boy]
"Grade A, the best rank?"

[Taichi]
"No, one above is S."

[Boy]
"Oh wow, that's how I categorize too..."

[Taichi]
"You too?!"

Who was this guy I could naturally get along with?

[Boy]
"Okay, I feel like I can make it here."

[Taichi]
"Gunjo has sexy girls, good food, and is
broad-minded."

[Boy]
"Oh shoot. Sexy girls, huh? I feel like the doors
are finally opening up for me!!"

[Taichi]
"Let's go!!"

[Boy]
"Yeah! Let's go!"
"I feel like I've known you for a while."

[Taichi]
Same. I feel like we already have a score to settle.

[Boy]
"Bring it on."

He said confidently.

[Boy]
"But before that, give me the lowdown on Ms.
Machiko."

[Taichi]
"Looks like we are gonna be war buddies, huh?"
"We're of a different race, but good luck, Japanese
kid."

[Boy]
"But...you're also Japanese."

That was how I met Yutaka Shinkawa.
