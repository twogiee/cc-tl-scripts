And, home.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

No one was around.
No sign of Mutsumi.
She normally greeted me warmly when I came home
early.
She would make supper.
And fill the table with food.
Manly food.
I wondered if it was because of her work, or
anything work-related.
It was grand and made a great impact on me.
We would crack jokes with each other.
She was such a good person.
But now, the table looked flat and empty.
No food on the table.

[Taichi]
"I'm hungry..."

I had brought some cup noodles from Tazaki Mart.
I guess that would be my dinner.
Ugh, the electric kettle wouldn't turn on.
There was a small party space in the yard, I could
boil some water there, but...

[Taichi]
"So troublesome."

I decided to eat it as it was.
*crunch crunch* (Uncooked noodles)
*gulp gulp* (Cold water)
*munch munch munch* (Noodles)
*gulp gulp gulp* (Water)
*munch munch munch munch* (Noodles)
*crunch* (Dry bamboo shoot)

[Taichi]
"This is just sad."

Could you even call this a meal?
This world ending thing was pretty rough.
There were a lot of inconveniences.
I lit a candle.
I decided to do some journal writing.
It all seemed Hemingway-esque.
I looked for a notebook to use for the journal, but
couldn't find one anywhere.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

There should've been a stack of them somewhere.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

Maybe inside the safe.
I checked there just in case.
I kept all my porno inside the safe.
It was fireproof, so even if the house burnt down, I
would still have my collection.
I opened the safe to check.
...
30 minutes later, I closed the safe.
There weren't any notebooks in there.

[Taichi]
*sigh*

I was wasting time.
The inside of this safe just takes so much of my
time every time I open it... Heheheh...
Such a sinful vault.
Now, where were those notebooks?
Did I lose my memory?

[Taichi]
"It's common for the main character to lose their
memory, after all."

Youko had given me a notebook.
Great timing.
I wondered if she was some kind of goddess.
I removed the plastic cover.
All right, let's write.

[Taichi]
"..."

I didn't have a pen.
I didn't see one around.

[Taichi]
"Inside the safe?"

I opened up the safe again. To look for a pen.
...
45 minutes later, I closed the safe.
No pen.
But there was some sort of love.

[Taichi]
*phew*

I really needed to write, so I shouldn't have been
going through consecutive battles.
Such was the temptation of my dream box!
I found the pen right next to my desk.
I wrote in my diary.
I wanted a dictionary now.
But there was no dictionary to be seen.

[Taichi]
"..."

I opened the safe.
...
An hour and 27 minutes later, I closed the safe.

[Taichi]
"Heh."

Today I was working overtime.
My "Ultimate Body Pillow" was really living up to
its name.
It was already past 10 o'clock.

[Taichi]
"Whoa?!"

The large candle was already gone.
Shoot, I had wasted too much time.
I had a good joke to make about body pillows...
I'd write it in my journal.
I lit a new candle and faced the notebook.
