Miki and Kiri were there.

[Taichi]
"Is there any food...?"

[Miki]
"Unfortunately not."

[Taichi]
"That lunch box...?"

Rice.
Meatballs.

[Taichi]
"H-hey, what is that doing here...?"

[Miki]
"Kiri made it, using camp utensils."

[Taichi]
"Wow, I'm jealous."

[Kiri]
"There's none for you."

Straight to the point.

[Taichi]
"There seems to be a lot."

[Miki]
"Isn't there?"

Obviously, it was enough for three people.

[Kiri]
"But for some reason, there's not enough for you."

[Taichi]
"Hmph..."

Innocence was roaring.

[Taichi]
"Then let's trade."

[Miki]
"Ah, a trade."

[Taichi]
"Candy and gummy bears. Handmade."

Their attitudes suddenly changed.

[Miki]
"Handmade?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. By Youko."
"Reduced sugar, good for health and beauty.
These gummy bears are organic. No calories."

[Both]
"No calories?!"

...

[Taichi]
"Yay!"

Trade established.

[Miki]
"It tastes like what mommy makes..."

[Kiri]
"It sure does."

[Miki]
"It's milk."

[Kiri]
"Yeeah."

[Taichi]
"It's actually a stalker's taste."

[Miki]
"Yummy... So yummy..."

[Kiri]
"Mmm..."

Girls.
Thanks to that, I was able to eat rice.
Proved I was Japanese.

[Taichi]
"It's good... Kiri has cooking skills."

[Kiri]
"Side dishes are ready-made..."

[Taichi]
"But it's good."

[Kiri]
"And if I don't, Miki will just eat snacks."

[Miki]
"I like snacks."

[Taichi]
"We're all going through rough times with food."

[Miki]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"Let's get married, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"That's impossible."

[Miki]
"She didn't say no, Taichi, she said impossible."

[Taichi]
"I'm burning up for that challenge."

[Kiri]
"You want me to dump water on you?"

[Taichi]
"Again?"

[Miki]
"Are there any more snacks?"

[Taichi]
"There are. Biscuits and shortbread. Youko's very
good at making snacks."

[Miki]
"Wow, that's unexpected."

[Taichi]
"It seems like they are good for rations."

[Kiri]
"You two are dating, right?"

[Taichi]
"What, Youko and I?"

[Miki]
"I was really wondering about that too."
"So much that I had to stop eating."

[Taichi]
"You just had your mouth full."

[Miki]
*chomp*

Midsummer hamster girl.

[Taichi]
"No, we just lived together, that's it."

[Miki]
"Cohabitation."

[Kiri]
"Cohabitation."

They harmonized.

[Taichi]
"No. It's nothing like that."
"Umm, we didn't have any parents so Mutsumi took
both of us in. Ah, Mutsumi is my guardian, by the
way."
"It's like being brothers and sisters... But I don't
look at it like that."

And neither did she.
That was why Youko was forced out.

[Miki]
"Hmm, that's a first."

[Kiri]
"I could've sworn it was more suspicious..."

It was really suspicious, actually.

[Taichi]
"Well, you know. We're not blood-related or
anything."

[Miki]
Hasekura is full of mysteries

[Taichi]
"Tell me about it."
"Now, here, take this candy. Let's get in a festive
mood now."

[Miki]
"Yay! Candy!"

Kiri took it away.

[Miki]
"Hey! Give it back!"

[Kiri]
"You can't just have snacks."

[Miki]
"You were eating them too!"

[Kiri]
"You still have to eat real food. We have to
maintain our health on our own now."

[Miki]
"Okaaay..."

Hmmm.

[Kiri]
"What is it? Don't give me that lewd look..."

[Taichi]
"Don't call it lewd."
"I just thought you two work well together."

[Miki]
"Since we are the Flowers."

[Taichi]
"It makes me want to release you as a duet."

[Miki]
"Not much of a chance now..."

[Kiri]
"Eight CD sales at the most."

[Miki]
"Going platinum is a dream of dreams."

[Kiri]
"Then I'll buy two of them."

[Miki]
"I'll buy two as well."

[Kiri]
"Then ten."

[Miki]
"Yup, ten. Double digits."

They giggled.
They really were intimate.
I was a little enriched by that.
