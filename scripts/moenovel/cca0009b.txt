[Taichi]
"Whoops."

I slipped.
Totally an accident. Wasn't intentional.
I flapped my arms.
But it was too late: I was already gravity's captive
(damn you Newton!).
Anyhow, my hand reached for Miki's chest area.

[Miki]
"Huh?"

Miki must have been caught off guard because she
just stood there with the same smile on her face.
Oh no!
My spontaneous booby and/or butt groping could go
against the ethics of the "For All Ages" regulation!
But it was unintentional!
And...
*squish*
When I came to my senses I realized I had her
boob clawed in my hand.
There wasn't much, but something was definitely
there on her surf board of a chest.

[Miki]
"Shoot."

She kept her smile, but her mouth twitched.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, my foot slipped and..."

[Miki]
"No, it was my fault for being careless."

[Taichi]
"It's probably something I shouldn't say, but...
There's a little something there. Good for you!"

[Miki]
"That's kind of you. When are you going to take
your hand off?"

[Taichi]
"You've got some hope for the future."

[Miki]
"Umm, I don't know whether to be happy or angry.
So, how long are you going to touch me?"

[Taichi]
"I'm deeply moved. Small, no, flat-chested Miki has
finally achieved a three-dimensional figure."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

She started to cry.

[Taichi]
"H-huh?"

I made her cry?
I made her cry?

[Miki]
"Er..."

She cried quietly.
There was no weeping, just tears sliding down her
face.
The kind of tears artists cried when they've been
presented by beauty.
I'm 99\p sure they weren't the kind of tears caused
by some creep's sexual harassment.
I fumbled for words.
Then stopped.
I couldn't understand it.

[Taichi]
"Hey..."

Before long, Miki wiped her tears.
She swiped her arms across her face, and was back to
her usual smiling self when she was done.

[Miki]
"Heehee."
"Now, cleaning time!"
"But first... Hiyah!"

[Taichi]
"Arrggh!"

She struck at my arm's pressure point.

[Taichi]
"Oww, my muscle hurts so bad! It's so tense I can't
open up my fist!"

I struggled with pain.

[Miki]
"Sweep, sweep."

Miki continued cleaning.
And then...

[Taichi]
"Are you Miki?"

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"No, nothing. Sorry."

[Miki]
"Is it because I have some boobs that you're 
asking if I'm Miki?"

I pretended to spit in the air.

[Taichi]
"Honestly, I'm disappointed."

[Miki]
*groan*

[Taichi]
"You have no idea how many dedicated fans
you just let go."

[Miki]
"Dedicated fans?"

[Taichi]
"Even if you aren't a loli, you could've been a
pedo's wet-dream for the ages. Such a waste..."

[Miki]
"What has this world come to."

[Taichi]
"Stupid Miki, sorry for harassing you!"

I ran away, insulting her and apologizing at the
same time.
