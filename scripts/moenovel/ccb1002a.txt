[Taichi]
"Anyhow, should we do some club activities?"

[Misato]
"I guess."

She stared right at me.

[Misato]
"Did you come here to assist me?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"Is that so."

Her gaze at me froze.
Then she smiled.

[Misato]
"Thank you very much, Pekke."

[Taichi]
"Just my duty as an imperial soldier."

I saluted.
She giggled.

[Misato]
"Unfortunately, it's nearly dark."
"Fun club time is over."

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

[Misato]
"I'm sorry. I've decided to do it on my own, so
there wasn't really a set schedule."

[Taichi]
"But you can't finish this on your own. There's
still wiring to be done."
"And there's the power line, too."

[Misato]
"No worries."
"Women have to show guts."

[Taichi]
"Then men have to show love."
"Misato, I, I-"

I tried to scoot closer, and...

[Misato]
"Club hours are over!"

[Taichi]
"Ugh!"

Her arm pushed my face away and probably made my
face even uglier.
Saying 'Ugh!' like that made me feel like I was at
the bottom of the Mariana Trench.

[Misato]
"Right, let's go home. That being said, your home is
the complete opposite way of my home. Hahaha."

[Taichi]
"Something doesn't sit right."

[Misato]
"But you had a lot of fun today, no?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, I don't know."

[Misato]
"You touched my butt when you dug your face
into my boobs, didn't you?"

[Taichi]
"That was an accident."

[Misato]
"You even rubbed it around."
"With both hands, too."

[Taichi]
"Like I said, an accident."

[Misato]
"Hm, well, okay. If you say so."
"It tickled."

[Taichi]
"Misato, my safety is still on."

[Misato]
"Safety? What?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. I woke up suddenly this morning with that
feature."
"I am Taichi, suitable for all ages, and the most
juvenile of them all."

[Misato]
"Juvenile?"

[Taichi]
"That's right, it's troubling."

[Misato]
"So, copyrights and sexual harassment are no longer
on your side then."

[Taichi]
"Unfortunately."

[Misato]
"That is...troublesome."

[Taichi]
"It feels like having both my hands ripped off."
"But, that's okay."

I let out a chuckle and looked up into the sky as if
I was in some corny TV drama.

[Taichi]
"My attitude towards you will still be wholesome."

[Misato]
"Good boy."

Then I got a hug again.
I was now, a wholesome boy.
I was no longer corrupt.

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry..."

[Misato]
"Heheh."

In the bright orange background, she ever so
slightly tilted her body and said...

[Misato]
"I'll forgive you, but it's time to go home and
reflect on yourself."
"Goodbye, Pekke."

I left the building and looked up at the rooftop.
The antenna was up.
And next to it...
...Was Misato, still there.
She was working.
Even though it was almost night time.
Working by herself.
Then I realized something.
I realized that she had kindly declined my help.
