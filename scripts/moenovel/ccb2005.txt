I entered the classroom.

[Touko]
"Oh, Taichi..."

She ran over to me.
It looked like she was going to ask me if I wanted
to take a bath first or have dinner, like a newlywed
couple.

[Taichi]
"I'll eat while taking a bath."

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Touko]
"G-good morning."

[Taichi]
"You really came."

[Touko]
"Of course I did."

[Taichi]
"Where are your things...?"

[Touko]
"At home."
"So come back with me."

[Taichi]
"All right..."

Hmmm.
I felt a little fatigued.
I guess this was what it felt like to be a
22-year-old who wasn't able to enjoy life enough,
and faced with the reality of getting married.

[Touko]
"I put a lot of thought into picking out what
I should bring."
"Then I found an old photo."

She looked happy when she said this.

[Taichi]
"Ohh, an old photo."
"Speaking of old photos, I have a lot too."

[Touko]
"Really? You kept them for me?"

[Taichi]
"..."

I had tons of old photos (from a generation that was
generous).
I wasn't lying.

[Touko]
"I'm glad I didn't throw them away... I'm thinking
of sticking them up on my walls."
"I have enough to cover my walls from ceiling to
floor."

[Taichi]
"Wow..."

I acted surprised.
There were no good memories in the photos that
amounted to covering all the walls.

[Touko]
"Heheh."

She latched on to my arm.
Fast development!
Damn it, I knew this girl was...
I took an item out of my tool bag.
Taichi Item:
"Tool bag" (Also called Taichi's bag.)
A canvas shoulder bag containing lots of secret tools.
I "equipped" it immediately!

[Taichi]
"Look at this, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"An armband?"

The young lady looked closely.

[Touko]
"Love Birds... Anti..."
"Anti-Love Birds."

Touko reversed the order.

[Taichi]
"I take the influence of love birds on the
environment seriously. I work in a position
of regulation and restraint with a firm attitude."
"Let go of me."

She released me.

[Touko]
"I-it's the same old... But I have no idea what
you're talking about."

[Taichi]
"You should be careful about expressing
excessive affection in front of others."

[Touko]
"Others? There's nobody else..."

[Taichi]
"There's a few."

[Touko]
"Ugh..."

She wasn't satisfied.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, it's good that you're a backward type of
girl with a strong mind."

[Touko]
"Say wha?"

[Taichi]
"But if you get sweet it's too plain and ordinary!
Let's stick through it more boldly! Be strict when
you're shy. That's cooler... It's for your own good."

[Touko]
"O-okay..."

[Taichi]
"You're like a precious gem."

I put my hands on her shoulders as I spoke.

[Touko]
*gasp*

[Taichi]
"The glow of that gem is even brighter than
diamonds... But alas, diamonds are carbon
and burns if you put it on fire."
"Goddamn. That's my understanding of the stupidity
of preserving all your life's fortunes with a
diamond."

I pinched a wisp of her hair, brushed it against my
nose, and savored the scent.

[Touko]
"???"

[Taichi]
"There are pros and cons. Please understand, my
lovely lady."

[Touko]
"I don't really understand, but okay."

[Taichi]
"So, are you on board?"

[Touko]
"Taichi, so you're embarrassed of being clingy in
front of people."

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

I was lost for words with her complete
misunderstanding of everything I had just said.

[Touko]
"You've got a cute side."

She lightly hit my back.
Was I being cute?
I, Kurosu Taichi, known for being 'ugly-phobia', was
being cute?!
Was that allowed?
No way!

[Taichi]
"Hey Kirihara!"

*muah*
I was kissed.
It was on my forehead.
My throbbing heartbeat short-circuited.

[Touko]
"Eheheh..."

She laughed innocently.
T-This...
Girl!
She was so cute!

[Touko]
"Huh?"

I just hugged her.
Ah, I miserably failed.
But I won't be confused anymore!

[Touko]
"Purr..."

Just like that onomatopoeia, I'll...

[Touko]
"Purr..."

Touko acted like a cat and scratched my chest.

[Taichi]
"Aww..."

I have melted.
The sudden birth of love birds.
