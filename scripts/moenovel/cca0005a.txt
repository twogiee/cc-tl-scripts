The others usually had morning practice at this
time.
But with the school festival on the horizon, morning
training was the last thing on their minds...

[Taichi]
"I'm going to go up to the roof for a minute."
"Someone might think I'm playing hooky. If the
teacher comes, cover for me."

Touko let out a sarcastic chuckle.
I think she was trying to show her contempt of me.
But she wasn't doing very well.
If you truly wanted to ignore someone, you had to do
it 100\p.
You had to pretend they're air, like you could see
right through them.
The emotional impact was lacking.
25 points.
She lost points for not only for recognizing me, but
for recognizing there was an "us."

[Touko]
"Cover? Are you dreaming?"

[Taichi]
"Just of a better future!"

As usual, I headed for the hall.

[Taichi]
"Better than yours."

[Touko]
"Keep talking."

See, that was the best Touko could come up with.
She had half stood up and was glaring after me, but
she couldn't bring herself to make eye contact.

[Taichi]
"Join the club, if you're in the mood."

[Touko]
"..."

She had a look of pure hatred on her face.
Any more, and I'd just be starting a fight.
I left without saying anything else...except for one
thing.

[Taichi]
"I really do love you."

A textbook came flying at me.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

I used the door as a shield.
Hoo boy... People can be so hard to figure out.
