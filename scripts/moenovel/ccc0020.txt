This was still the best place to eat lunch.

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, Taichi."

It was Curry Roll Sakuraba.
He loved super spicy curry rolls.

[Taichi]
"The world's ending and you're still eating curry
rolls."

[Sakuraba]
"Not giving you any."

[Taichi]
"Don't need any."

[Sakuraba]
"There's no more once I finish these."

He got gloomy.
There were stacked cases of curry rolls behind him.

[Taichi]
"When were these brought in?"

[Sakuraba]
"Maybe yesterday?"

Yesterday.
They did sell bread even if it was half-day.
The cafeteria was generally open except on off days.
They even delivered bread on the first day of
school.
That's right.
It meant that the world was still operational
yesterday.

[Taichi]
"There's not much in there."

There were only about a tenth of the usual cases.

[Sakuraba]
"Probably because it's the opening ceremony. You
know, half day."

[Taichi]
"Still... Not much."

[Sakuraba]
"Plus, I don't think the world really ended."

[Taichi]
"What did you just say?"

[Sakuraba]
"My prediction is that everyone's playing
hide-and-seek."

[Taichi]
"That's a delusion."
"And don't use words like prediction. It sounds like
you already have a conclusion."

[Sakuraba]
"Heh... So strict."

[Taichi]
"Don't grin like you're satisfied."

[Sakuraba]
"But there's nothing to worry about."
"Everyone should be back over time, according
to my calculations."

[Taichi]
"I'm pretty optimistic, but you're optimistic down
to the core."

[Sakuraba]
"Heh."

Why was he even among the wounded boys and
girls here?
It really got me to think deeply.
Then Sakuraba handed me a curry roll.

[Sakuraba]
"Eat."

[Taichi]
"Nope!"

I declined straightaway.
