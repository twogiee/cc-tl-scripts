Just as I left my house for school, I ran into Youko
Hasekura.

[Youko]
"Good morning, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, well, I'll see you later!"

I tried to walk away.
She grabbed my shirt from behind.

[Taichi]
"Agghh..."

[Youko]
"Listen to what I have to say for once!"

Her voice was shaking.

[Taichi]
"You're my junior, so don't try crap like that
with me!"
"This is why I can't trust you completely."

[Youko]
"That's a moderately severe response."

[Taichi]
"Are you trying to make me dance on your palm,
you short, thick-hipped nymph?"

[Youko]
"You sound like Tomoki Shima. A bit delusional."

I was made to be delusional.

[Youko]
"It's fine. Whatever. Taichi, you look like a
monkey, anyway."

[Taichi]
"Don't make fun of me. I am of the primate family."

[Youko]
"..."

I had a feeling I was still being made fun of.
Damn defiant girl.
I'm going to bully you.
I'll lift your skir-

[Taichi]
"Whaaat?!"

...Or maybe not.

[Taichi]
"Metal?!"

Her skirt didn't move an inch.
What the hell.

[Youko]
"Yikes..."

[Taichi]
"There's no reason to act embarrassed!"
"I can't lift this skirt at all!"

[Youko]
"..."

Well, then if it's like that, all I have to do is
accidentally fall down!

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

I 'fell down' between her legs, with my face
looking up.
It was a painful self-sacrifice.

[Taichi]
"Wooohoooo!"
"Those are some sexy shorts
you've got on underneath!"

[Youko]
"A woman is always at war."

She kept her cool.

[Taichi]
"Can I take them off?"

[Youko]
"Anytime."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Go ahead."

Ugh.
How boring.
This kind of girl wasn't my type.
She wasn't embarrassed.
No fun at all.
There was no reason to get all horny over her.
Aside from the physical reasons...
I got up.

[Taichi]
"Okay then."

I took something out of my bag.
Then I held her nose closed.
I waited until she had to open her mouth for air.

[Youko]
"..."

Five seconds.
10 seconds.
30 seconds.
One minute.
One minute 30 seconds.

[Taichi]
"Can you breathe?"

[Youko]
"..."

Why was she okay?
I quit.
I let go and she resumed breathing normally.

[Youko]
"If you have a lot of oxygen in your blood,
you can hold off breathing for a long time."

[Taichi]
"You're like a pearl diver."

[Youko]
"Why did you do that?"

[Taichi]
"I wanted your mouth to open."

[Youko]
"Ahhhh..."

Well, that was easy.

[Taichi]
"Stick out your tongue."

[Youko]
"Ahh..."

She had such a long tongue.
I shook out 10 drops of habanero sauce.
Then I got my finger ready.
And wiped it all over her tongue.

[Taichi]
"Okay, finished."

[Youko]
"..."

At first I thought she was okay, but then...

[Youko]
"Agggn..."

She closed her mouth and started shaking.
She had to lean against the wall.
Ha, that did the trick.
She had a much longer tongue than most,
so it must have been quite sensitive.

[Taichi]
"You want a drink?"

[Youko]
"Yeah...yeah...quickly!"

She grabbed it away and gulped it down.

[Taichi]
"Enjoy the chili juice?"

[Youko]
"Um..."

She collapsed next to the hedge.

[Taichi]
"I win!"

It had been a while since I had felt total victory.
Well, time for school.

[Youko]
"At least...take this...lunch..."

She said while crawling to me.
With her eyes filled with tears, she tried to hand
me a paper bag.
It made me feel a little guilty.

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'll take it."

So motherly of me.
Even though I wasn't a mother.

[Youko]
"Good...bye..."

She looked thankful, but not really happy.
