As I was returning to the classroom, I came across a
girl, crouched down on the floor.
It was Miki.
Miki Yamanobe.

[Taichi]
"Yo."

[Miki]
"Hn?!"

Miki stood up.
She moved quickly.
She turned back slowly.

[Miki]
"Oh, hello there."

She raised her head and nodded.
Pretty much par for the course with her.
But something seemed off.
Had Miki always been this strong?
She always had good qualities, but she somehow
seemed stronger than ever.
That was the feeling I got.

[Taichi]
"What are you up to?"

[Miki]
"Cleaning."

[Taichi]
"I did that, too. Cleaning, I mean."

[Miki]
"Just because I said it, doesn't mean you have to
say it too. I think you are lying!"

[Taichi]
"I would not!"

[Miki]
"Why are you angry?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"Why are you silent?"

[Taichi]
"You don't have to rub it in."

[Miki]
"Hahah! I win!"

So strong.

[Taichi]
"Ah, it just occurred to me."

I cleared my throat.

[Taichi]
"...Mankind was destroyed."

[Miki]
"You did it!"

[Taichi]
"Huh?!"

We fought.

[Taichi]
"Unh."
"Ah."
"Huh?"
"Oh?!"

I took a direct blow.
How was she this strong?
She had downed a Karade master.

[Taichi]
"You..."

Maybe it was time to get serious.

[Miki]
"Shoo."

Her flexible leg lifted high above her waist.
I was going to take a sweep at her leg, but then I
caught a glimpse of her white panties.

[Taichi]
"Ooooh..."

The battle paused.
Oh wow, her panties...
Want to look. Shouldn't look.
Want to look. Shouldn't look.
Things got complicated.
But I was a noble, was I not?
Would a noble fret over panties?
The manly Taichi wouldn't just meekly choose to look
at any pair of panties presented to him!
Gyah... (Saw them!)
My eyes followed her leg as it came at me.
Her kick was coming fast.
I prepared to use my Karade to intercept the blow.
Her foot effortlessly penetrated my defenses.

[Taichi]
"What?"

Impossible.
A direct hit to the jaw.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

I lost consciousness.
...
...
...

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Miki]
"Oh, good. Are you okay?"

[Taichi]
"Ooogh. How long was I out?"

[Miki]
"Not even a minute."

[Taichi]
"Oh, I finally lost to you, huh!"

I tapped her on the knee.

[Miki]
"I suppose."
"But you were extremely careless, weren't you?"

[Taichi]
"Actually, there were no other options to choose..."
"Still, I probably would have chosen that option,
even if my life depended on it."

[Miki]
"You'd risk your life to see panties?!"

[Taichi]
"Heheheh."

I waved my finger at her.

[Taichi]
"Not just any panties, but panties that you're
wearing in real life! "

[Miki]
"No, that's not..."

[Taichi]
"Even if it's not..."

*grab*
I reached for the edge of her skirt.
But she grabbed my arm tightly.

[Taichi]
"Huh? You blocked that?!"

[Miki]
"Heheh."

I was astonished.

[Taichi]
"You've become a master."

I wrapped my arms around my knees and shrunk
down like a fried shrimp.

[Taichi]
"I guess I should call it a day."

[Miki]
"You sound so sad."

I swayed back and forth.

[Miki]
"Please cheer up, okay?"

[Taichi]
"I'm fine. I just want to be alone."

[Miki]
"Here we go again."
"..."
"Though there's no need for that."

[Taichi]
"Oui?"

I answered like a Frenchman.

[Miki]
"Everybody is so ordinary."

Her voice trembled suddenly.

[Taichi]
"Miki? Miki?"

[Miki]
"Look. My hands are shaking."

Her extended hands looked sweaty and cold.
It was almost as if she was afraid.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Miki]
"All of the pressure the seniors are putting on me
is starting to take its toll."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"So please cheer up."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

Was she trying to cheer me up?
I just couldn't get past the feeling that something
wasn't right.
Hmm. Maybe I'm losing touch with reality.

[Taichi]
"Okay then. Would you like to master your art?"

I punched.

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Take out your notebook."

[Miki]
"Oh, ohhh... You're doing that thing."
"It's been a while."

She gave a miserable look.
Or rather (rather?), she looked like she was on the
verge of tears (tears?).
My mind was running in circles.
She took out her student notebook.

[Miki]
*gasp*

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

She was crying.
Or rather (rather?), she was crying (crying?).
My mind was running in circles.

[Taichi]
"I guess that took you by surprise, huh?"

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"That this would happen to the world."

[Miki]
"Yeah..."

I had my reasons for being delicate.

[Miki]
"Yeah. That might be it."

[Taichi]
"Right?"
"I, for one, was certainly surprised."

[Miki]
"You, too?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."
"It means there are a lot of ripe 13 to 15 year-olds
I won't be meeting..."

[Miki]
"Excuse me?"

[Taichi]
"I'm kidding."

I picked up her notebook.

[Taichi]
"You sure do use your handbook a lot, Miki.
It's worn-out."

[Miki]
"Worn-out."

Repeating my words, meant she agreed.
The handbook was filled with autographs that I'd
written.
Page after page.
It was starting to look like some sort of autograph
practice book.
I found an empty page and filled in my autograph.
When did this all start?
All of this foolishness.
I handed her notebook back.
She took it and hugged it to her chest.
Tightly.
As if she was hugging the life she had lost.
I wiped the tears from her cheek.
Could I be anymore of a gentleman?

[Miki]
"Thanks."

[Taichi]
"So then..."

I looked down the hallway.

[Taichi]
"You going to keep cleaning?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, I guess it's good to move your body once in a
while."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."
