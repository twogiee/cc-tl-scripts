[Taichi]
"Okay then."

I lit a candle.
I thought over everything as I wrote in my
journal.
Yesterday had Youko died.
And today, it had been Touko.
They had been murdered.
I didn't know who killed them.
I didn't think it could have been Kiri.
Excluding me...that left four other people.
One of the four had killed their own friends.

[Taichi]
"That's heavy..."

But I didn't know who.
I couldn't fathom it.
What was the perpetrator's motive for killing not
one, but two people?
Youko.
Killed by an arrow.
Such a simple trap.
Everyone makes mistakes.
The person who had set the trap had killed Youko.
I didn't know if they had wanted to kill Youko or
not, but Youko had been the one that had died.
Touko.
She had been stabbed with a knife.
There had been no signs of a struggle.
It was like she had been asleep.

[Taichi]
"..."

There had been footprints in front of the shrine.
They had been from my shoes.
I didn't recall being in front of the shrine.
I didn't feel like I had lost my memory either.
Someone must have walked around in my shoes.
Or that person had the same shoes.
Horrifying thoughts raced through my mind.
Maybe I've lost control of myself.
What if I became aggressive toward others?
...someone crazy enough wouldn't even need a
motive...
Could any of the four suspects even build
a trap like that?
Did they really have the skills?
I had come to a frightful scenario.
...That it could have been me.
1) Sleepwalking?
2) Dual personality?
I wouldn't have been able to set a trap in my sleep,
so it couldn't be option 1.
And I wouldn't have been able to set it without a
clear mind, so option 2 didn't seem likely.
Did I really have a split personality?
That would explain my lack of memory.
Man, what a cliche.
I'd rather have a clone, that a split personality.

[Taichi]
"Whatever."

I finished my journal entry
with "Details not presently clear."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I blew out the candle.
Outside I could hear light footsteps.
I looked out the window.
It was Kiri.
Walking alone in this town without people.
I had seen her yesterday too.
It was suspicious.
I didn't really think she was a top suspect, but her
hatred of me was really strong.
I decided to follow to her.
I borrowed a bike along the way.
I carefully followed her.
She came a clearing within a grove.
I left the bike and continued on foot.
I got down low and snuck closer.
Kiri took something out of her bag.
It was a crossbow!
And clearly no toy.
It was the strongest weapon you could get in this
country.
The rate of fire was slow, but...
It was an exceedingly powerful weapon. And almost
silent as well.
Kiri pulled the trigger.
She put a bolt into a dead tree.
I only heard the sound of the wind.
Kiri took out another arrow.
She cocked and loaded the crossbow.
She was clumsy at it...
But I knew...
She was training.
For a battle...
But, with who?
Who would she battle?
A dark aura seemed to be coming out of Kiri.
Her eyes were emotionless.
She moved robotically.
Hit or miss, her expression didn't change.
"That's why I don't understand why
you'd get close to this guy!!"
"Who made you queen...?!"
"Murderer! Who are you going to kill next?!"
There was still so much mystery
surrounding Youko and Touko.
But.
Kiri's motives were almost too clear.
She continued to train for about an hour.
Exhausted, she slowly cleaned up and left.
After she had left the clearing, I went to check on
the tree she had been shooting at. It looked like
her target had been me after all...
I went back home.
I was exhausted...
Sakuraba was there.

[Taichi]
"Yo..."

I kicked him in the butt.

[Sakuraba]
"Oh! Taichi!"

He was eating a cucumber.
I had gotten that cucumber from Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"So?"

[Sakuraba]
"Listen."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Sakuraba]
"I got tired of curry rolls."

[Taichi]
"You know what...?"

[Sakuraba]
"So, I came here, and you had cucumbers."

[Taichi]
"Yeah so, why are you in my house?"

[Sakuraba]
"I told Tomoki that I wasn't going to eat anymore."

[Taichi]
"W-why?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because I'm done with curry rolls."

Such an ad hoc life he had.

[Taichi]
"So what's with all the luggage?"

[Sakuraba]
"Oh, I'm taking a trip."

[Taichi]
"Say what...?"

[Sakuraba]
"A trip."

[Taichi]
"You're...going traveling at a time like this?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah. Traveling is good for the soul."

Sakuraba was ecstatic.

[Sakuraba]
"Traveling is more important now than ever, don't
you think?"

[Taichi]
"I think I'll stay put..."

[Sakuraba]
"An opposite way of thinking, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, that's right!"

Dare to travel.
Who dares wins.

[Sakuraba]
"So, I'd like you to split the food with me."

[Taichi]
"That's fine by me."

We split the food in the box of food Tomoki had
brought over.

[Taichi]
"So, where are you going?"

[Sakuraba]
"I haven't decided. I'll go to the next town
and then I'll think about it."
"Who knows? Maybe I'll find people."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

He had been thinking.

[Taichi]
"Take a hand radio with you. There doesn't seem to
be any radio interference, so we can probably
communicate."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, I'll take it."

[Taichi]
"SSB right? Hang on a second, I'll lend you
an antenna that can even reach overseas."

[Sakuraba]
"Thanks."

I used my knowledge of wristwatches and such.
I made a super telecom antenna out of chopsticks and
nichrome wire.
I gave it to him.

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Sakuraba]
"Oh thanks. I can use this to talk to people overseas."

[Taichi]
"Hahah, only if you understand them.
But I don't think you can..."

[Sakuraba]
"Voce poderia me pagar de volta a taxa de envio?"
(Could you pay me back the shipping charge?)

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Que fiasco!"
(What a fiasco!)

[Taichi]
"Seriously...?"

What the hell?

[Sakuraba]
"I can get along with Romance languages."
"I spent some time in Brazil so I can speak a little
Portuguese."

Wow!
Was he...bilingual?

[Taichi]
"You know actually, I can speak Russian."

[Sakuraba]
"I see."
"If I talk to any Russians I'll leave it to you."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah. Hang in there. When are you coming back?"

[Sakuraba]
"When I feel like it."

"I see."

[Sakuraba]
"Also, don't I owe you money?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, a little."

[Sakuraba]
"How much was it?"

There was no point in this.
What a weirdo.

[Taichi]
"Hm, I don't remember."

[Sakuraba]
"I'll just give you all of my change."

He took out his wallet.
I took it from him.
It jingled.

[Taichi]
"Hahah, even bilingual people
fall on tough times huh?"

Sakuraba gave a friendly laugh.

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah well, even the rich have times like that."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Sakuraba]
"Hahah."

We both laughed hard.
We shook hands.
I made a friend.

[Taichi]
"So, let's see how much is in here."

I opened his wallet.
As expected there were no bills.
There were fifteen 100,000 yen gold pieces.

[Taichi]
"Mr Money Bags!"

I felt light-headed.

[Sakuraba]
"What's up?"

[Taichi]
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"

I writhed like a worm.
What's up with this wallet?!
I've never seen anything like it.
Inspecting further it wasn't just gold pieces.
Eight 100,000 yen gold coins
commemorating Emperor Showa.
Seven 100,000 yen gold coins
commemorating the enthronement.
Two 50,000 yen gold coins
commemorating the crown prince's wedding.
Four 50,000 yen gold coins
commemorating an exhibition in Osaka.
Three 50,000 yen gold coins
commemorating another royal wedding.
It didn't stop there.

[Taichi]
"This is ridiculous!"

[Sakuraba]
"I couldn't use those for shopping."

[Taichi]
"Of course you can't!"

This guy... He wasn't worried about money at all.
Did he not consider 100,000 yen a lot at all?
At all? At all???

[Taichi]
"Huh?!"

If only I demanded gold coins before the end of
humanity...

[Taichi]
"Waah waah waah!"

[Sakuraba]
"Why're you crying?"

[Taichi]
"Waaaaaaaaah!"

God was so cruel!
I had nothing but remorse.

[Sakuraba]
"This should make up for whatever I owe you."

He took out a wooden box.
Turning it over in my hands I see an old design of
rivers and mountains.

[Taichi]
"What's this?"

[Sakuraba]
"I just picked something that looked expensive."

[Taichi]
"The creator...there was a... certificate of
authenticity. Oh, it's Mr Tensho Shubun."

[Sakuraba]
"Is he famous?"

[Taichi]
"I'll check."

I grabbed a related picture book
from Mutsumi's room.

[Taichi]
"Nothing cheap would be in here."

[Sakuraba]
"That would suck. It looked like the most expensive
one."

[Taichi]
"Shubun! How much further are you going to surprise
me?!"

It was a registered national treasure.

[Taichi]
"..."

I fainted.

[Sakuraba]
"Oh Taichi! Taichi!"

...

[Taichi]
"If this is real, don't you think you're
desecrating the nation, or something?"

[Sakuraba]
"Maybe? Well, I guess it makes a good story."

A culture bandit... That's what he was..
I just shivered.
Then Sakuraba said something abrupt.

[Sakuraba]
"So... You want to come with me?"

[Taichi]
"Hm... Travel with you?"

[Sakuraba]
"I invited Tomoki, but he has some stuff to do here."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, well."

[Sakuraba]
"So?"

[Taichi]
"It seems fun, but..."

Everyone's face flashed before me.
And all these mysteries.

[Taichi]
"I'll pass."

[Sakuraba]
"I see."

He didn't seem bothered.

[Sakuraba]
"Well, I'll get going then."

[Taichi]
"Why not go tomorrow? It could be dangerous
going over the mountains."

[Sakuraba]
"I feel like going now."

[Taichi]
"Ah, you're a thrill seeker."

[Sakuraba]
"Well, I've got food so I'll be on my way."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

I saw him off.

[Taichi]
"Oh, can I ask you something?"

[Sakuraba]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"Is there anyone in the club who you hate enough to
kill?"

[Sakuraba]
"No. I like everyone."

[Taichi]
"How virtuous."

[Sakuraba]
"It's not like that. I am mentally incapable.
I don't have the desire."

So that's how it was.

[Sakuraba]
"My personality, it was taken by you that day,
that time."

He looked happy.

[Taichi]
"That's creepy, stop."

[Sakuraba]
"No, an unpredictable person like me
shouldn't have a strong personality."
"So I focus that energy on other things I want to
do."

His eardrum had been ruptured that day.
It was unreal how relaxed he was.
But at the same time, he had no personality.
I didn't know what the cause was.
Perhaps lost love, or enlightenment.
He didn't know either.

[Taichi]
"One more question."
"Have you ever killed anyone?"

[Sakuraba]
"No. Never."

[Taichi]
"I see..."
"All right. You can go."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay, see ya..."

I had a final thought as I watched him go.
If he was the killer, I had just let him slip away.
But whatever.
I didn't think he was.
And thus...
Sakuraba was gone.
Gone... Just like that.
