[Taichi]
"An antenna worker's morning starts early. Even
while dawn hasn't broken, you're up making an
antenna on a rooftop."
"Well, it's because I love what I do. That's what
Misato Miyasumi, club president of the Gunjo Gakuin
Broadcasting Club says."
"The club members idolize our Misato Miyasumi, Mimi.
And some of her closest followers call her Mimimi."

[Misato]
"Pekke, I'm not like that at all..."

[Taichi]
"Wow, you heard me?"

[Misato]
"Yes, everything. What are you up to?"

[Taichi]
"I'm practicing. Practicing narration."

[Misato]
"It's good that you're serious about it."

[Taichi]
"But even more so..."

Pekke clapped his hands together, and put two
fingers out.
He then around and gestured.

[Misato]
"Bang? A T-sign...errr, okay sign? Salute?"

[Taichi]
"Heh...I'll give you one more chance!"

He clapped his hands together while mouthing
something.

[Misato]
"Are you trying to say 'pan'...?"

Then he held out two fingers to make a T.

[Misato]
"...T?"

Next, he made two circles with his fingers.

[Misato]
"Circles!"

Then he put those circles over his eyes.

[Misato]
"Glasses...?"
"Pan, then glasses?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi...you almost got it. You're so smart."

[Misato]
"What a compliment."

[Taichi]
"Listen. Here's the answer."

He did it again for me.

[Taichi]
"Pan, Ts... I can see them."

[Misato]
"Ah, I see now."

[Taichi]
"When we were kids, everyone was saying that, right?"

[Misato]
"I'm ignorant about stuff that's popular
these days."

[Taichi]
"No, no, no, that was ages ago."

[Misato]
"Oh."

[Taichi]
"If someone did that to you, back then you'd yell, 
'Pervert! Pervert! You stupid Pekke!' or something
like that."

[Misato]
"Is that how things went?"

[Taichi]
"That's because I treasure tradition and aesthetics!"

[Misato]
"Is it really that necessary?"

[Taichi]
"So please, go ahead."

[Misato]
"Go ahead and what?"

[Taichi]
"Go ahead and say it."

[Misato]
"You mean what you just told me?"

[Taichi]
"If you don't, I'll be scarred emotionally."

[Misato]
"Pervert! Pervert! You stupid Pekke!"

[Taichi]
"Wow, you called me stupid."

[Misato]
"How should I say it then? I have no idea."

[Taichi]
"It'd be cuter if you said it more shyly."

[Misato]
"Cuter?"

[Taichi]
"No, wait a second. Since you're older, there's also
the airhead option!"
"But you know this 'airhead' thing everyone does it
so overdone... I get it, you're trying to be funny
but it just kinda gets old..."

[Misato]
"Pekke, are you just saying out loud whatever comes
to your mind right now?"

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

[Misato]
"Well, I was thinking..."

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

[Misato]
"You're actually the airhead, right? Like much more
than I am."

[Taichi]
"Whassat? I'm totally an all-rounder character!"

[Misato]
"You know everything about me is just a facade,
right?"

[Taichi]
"Why are you calling me an airhead?
Is this a new thing for you?"

[Misato]
"I've been intentionally acting like an airhead!"

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

[Misato]
"In the back of my mind, I'm thinking about some
crazy stuff."

[Taichi]
"Crazy stuff?"

[Misato]
"Yes. Really crazy stuff."

[Taichi]
*gulp*
"Is that what you classify it as?"

[Misato]
"Well, I am your upperclassman. I'm older than you,
Pekke. An older girl."

[Taichi]
"Umm... Could you be more specific?
And give me a good fantasy?"

[Misato]
"Really, really crazy stuff."

[Taichi]
"Okay..."

[Misato]
"So you understand?"

[Taichi]
"I understand in the back of my mind."

[Misato]
"There's no way you understand that easily."

[Taichi]
"Well, anyway, the antenna...is messed up."

[Misato]
"Are you going to try to fix it?"

[Taichi]
"I'll give it my best."

[Misato]
"Good."

[Taichi]
"An antenna worker's morning starts early..."

[Misato]
"You said that already."

[Taichi]
"No one else gets here early?"

[Misato]
"No...I mean, they're all busy."

[Taichi]
"Well, let me go and get them all."

[Misato]
"Don't force them though..."

[Taichi]
"This isn't boot camp. I'll get them to help."

[Misato]
"Y'know...I can handle it myself."

[Taichi]
"Why do you always try to handle it alone like
that?"

[Misato]
"Well, being in a club gives us a sense of autonomy,
right?"

[Taichi]
"Misato...are you okay alone?"

[Misato]
"Well, I have to do it."

[Taichi]
"You want to make a distress signal, right?"

[Misato]
"There's a more important reason."

[Taichi]
"More important reason?"

[Misato]
"Yes. If I don't, then the broadcasting club
might be in trouble."

[Taichi]
"In trouble?"

[Misato]
"With our club budget for next year, we might not
get to continue with it, right?"

[Taichi]
"That is a problem."

[Misato]
"It's my greatest responsibility as a club
president."

[Taichi]
"So why not let the club members help?"

[Misato]
"Well, I don't like forcing anyone. Then club risks
being disbanded!"

[Taichi]
"I see, then I'll let them all know we're having
club activities now."

[Misato]
"Please do."
"It still gets so hot during the day.
Let's take a break."

Summer! The sunlight seemed to scream that as
it shone on us.

[Misato]
"I'm hungry too. Let's have something to eat."
"Tomoki..."

[Tomoki]
"S-Sis..."

[Misato]
"Um...are you okay?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

He totally ignored me.
No way.
Life is full of struggles.
I found some bread.
Cases of it.
Guess life wasn't always full of struggles.
They were all curry rolls....
Life sucked.

[Misato]
"Anything else...?"

I looked through the stacks of cases.

[Misato]
"Ah! I found some!"

Life always provided second chances.

[Misato]
"Panty bread..."

Was it something Pekke made?
Life was disappointing.

[Misato]
"Maybe Surstromming bread?"

Now that sounded dangerous.
Life was full of risks.
Decisions, decisions...
I had no choice in my life.
Under the case, there were a few pieces of 'normal'
bread.
Sandwiches, yakisoba bread, sweetbread...

[Misato]
"This food is important. I should eat it gratefully."
*yawn*

I felt a bit sleepy.
It was suddenly evening already.
The sun softened and it became cooler.

[Misato]
"Let's give it one more shot."

I went to repair the antenna
before the sun went down.

[Misato]
"It's gotten dark, so that's it for today's repairs."

I looked up at the antenna.
I got discouraged.
It wasn't coming together at all.

[Misato]
"This is worrisome."

I wrote in my troubleshooting notebook.
There was no way to finish by Sunday.

[Misato]
"Dang it."

It was going to be hard to secure the club funds
for this semester.

[Misato]
"Well then, maybe..."

We would have to disband.

[Misato]
"Anything but that!"

If that happens...if that happens...

[Misato]
"I have to work through the night!"
"I mean... I can't work in this dark...but I did my
best..."
"No, I haven't been drinking! Not at all! I'd get
expelled!"
"But I'm still hungry. All out of water and bread.
Any food around here? Oh! Tazaki! I can get
something at Tazaki!"
"This is non-alcoholic! Non-alcoholic! So...why am I
drunk?"
"Ah, what was I sayin'? Antenna fixin'? Impossible.
No way. Just as Pekke told me."
"But still... Pekke, sit down there."

[Taichi]
"Ummm..."

[Misato]
"What do you wanna do with this club...Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Anything that will help you, Chief Misato."

[Misato]
"Stop callin' me chief! I ain't chief of nothin'!"

[Taichi]
"Well, I didn't mean that."

[Misato]
"Listen. I...I...I'm gonna wreck everyone..."

[Taichi]
"Story of my life."

[Misato]
"Noooo. That's not right. So...don't expect too much
from me, 'kay?"
"..."
"They're all gone. All those kids who left me
are gonna get expelled!"
"Next is Touko!"

[Touko]
"What is it, Club President?"

[Misato]
"Yeah! That attitude of yours! Not good! Not good!"

[Touko]
"Why are you drunk?"

[Misato]
"I ain't drunk, I'm tellin' ya!"
"I wanted to tell ya. Touko, you gotta be more
flexible, 'kay? The reason this club's so awkward
is..."

[Touko]
"My fault...?"

[Misato]
"K-kinda..."

[Touko]
"I have nothing to do with it."

[Misato]
"Y-y-yeah...you put up a wall and crush the others!"
"No...wait...it's my fault. I'm the club president."
"I'm blamin' others...that means I'm a failure...
I'm a failed human!"
"So sad...pitiful... Everyone hates me..."
"Agh...dat cute girl...them flower girls!"

[Miki]
"C-Club President?"

[Kiri]
"What happened?"

[Misato]
"Lemme put your face in my soft boobs..."

[Miki]
"Um...we're not crude like that."

[Misato]
"That's unfair! I always let Pekke use 'em!
Come feel the warmth!"

[Miki]
"You need to understand how we feel first!"

[Kiri]
"Club President, you're turning into Taichi."

[Misato]
"Whaaaa?"
"Sexual harassment is bad. You don't drink liquor,
it drinks you. Don't drink and drive..."
"I hate myself... What's with all this liquor...
Huh? But it says non-alcoholic..."

[Sakuraba]
"Club President, that's wrong."

[Misato]
"Sakuraba...?"

[Sakuraba]
"You definitely are drinking liquor."

[Misato]
"Non-alcoholic! See! Non-alcoholic!
Crucial fact!"

[Sakuraba]
"Even if it's non-alcoholic, it's still liquor!"

[Misato]
"Really? Sorry..."

[Sakuraba]
"Just understand...please. Next time try drinking
curry rolls."

[Misato]
"Curly rolls?"

[Sakuraba]
"Not curly rolls...curry rolls... You can't get
drunk on them."

[Misato]
"Even if I can't get drunk... I can't drink 'em!"

[Sakuraba]
"You can drink curry rolls!"

[Misato]
"Wha?"
"I feel a bit sober now."

[Youko]
"..."

[Misato]
"You're not sober."
"Ah, Youko..."

[Youko]
"What...?"

[Misato]
"I'm drunk and seeing things, so I'll tell you now!"
"You're a ghost! If not, at least you seem like one
because you're never at this club!"

[Youko]
"You're not seeing things, this is reality..."

[Misato]
"Wha?"
"Tomoki..."

[Tomoki]
"Why are we doing this? Doing the broadcast club and
fixing antennas?"

[Misato]
"I really don't know either."

[Tomoki]
"Nothing works...and in a world with no people,
who even needs an antenna to broadcast?"

[Misato]
"There might...be someone."

[Tomoki]
"No one's there."

[Misato]
"Somewhere...someone..."

[Tomoki]
"No one's anywhere! Especially anyone who'd want to
contact you."

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"I mean, why even continue the club."

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Tomoki]
"That's why you're the worst!"

[Misato]
"I know, I know...but what should I do?"
"I know I am the worst..."
"But I have to do this."
"I have to communicate my feelings to someone!"
"H-huh...? Why am I here...?"

I woke up and realized I was sleeping on the bed in
the nurse's room.
Wha? I was sure I'd been working on the antenna
until late...then... I can't remember anything else.
Did something happen?
How did I get into the nurse's room?
Did I sleep on the rooftop, wake up, and then walk
here?
Or maybe Pekke woke me up, and brought me here...I
think.
Hmmm...

[Misato]
"Owowowowow..."

Thinking about it made my head hurt.
The sun's already up...and...I'm falling to sleep
again...
Morning...a new morning. A morning of hope.

[Misato]
*yawn*

Yesterday, the whole day, I slept through it all.
I slept so much that my joints hurt.

[Misato]
"Wait, that means..."

I counted on my fingers...

[Misato]
"Today is Wednesday?"

Only four days until Sunday.

[Misato]
"I can't let this happen."

I jumped out of bed, threw on clothes and whooosh,
I ran to the rooftop.
At least that's what I imagined...
In reality, I folded the bed up respectfully,
washed my face slowly...and was way behind.
*bam*
I finally got up to the rooftop.
The antenna...nothing's been done to it.

[Misato]
"Mr. Dwarf, you just missed your change..."

All of the little dwarfs of the club looked shocked.
They were different than the dwarfs
of the legendary cobbler's fairy tale.

[Misato]
"Guess I have to do it myself."

An incomplete antenna.
A half-finished and abandoned antenna.
It couldn't transmit or receive anything.

[Misato]
"You're not living up to your potential. All the
materials are there. Though they're a little
broken..."

Donk, donk, donk went the sound of assembly.
I went through cycles of working on it, resting,
then checking the progress.
I didn't know if I was doing it right,
but if it looked good...
If I could just transmit a bit, I'd be happy.

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Misato."

[Misato]
"Pekke, what is it?"

[Taichi]
"I've come to club. To help."

[Misato]
"Didn't I entrust you with the script...?"

[Taichi]
"What? The script?"

[Misato]
"The broadcast script. Deadline's this Sunday."

[Taichi]
"I don't remember it."

[Misato]
"That's fine."

[Taichi]
"Wait! Don't just blow me off! I remember.
I just have to rewrite it from the backed up data!"

[Misato]
"Well, I don't remember it either."

[Taichi]
"Huh? So you're not asking me to do it?"

[Misato]
"I guess that's how it is..."

[Taichi]
"Good."

[Misato]
"Let me ask you again. Please write the first script
for the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club."

[Taichi]
"Our farts broadcast."

[Misato]
"If you could, without the gags, okay?"

[Taichi]
"They're not gags, it's just my brain! Don't worry.
I'll just write up a grand script fit to be called
the efforts of a literary master and show you!"

[Misato]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"I can help with the manual labor, too."

[Misato]
"Let's see..."

[Taichi]
"You can't finish it alone."

[Misato]
"But I want to build the antenna myself."

[Taichi]
"Is this your stubbornness talking or just a spiteful
remark?"

[Misato]
"Perhaps, this antenna and I will become drinking
buddies."

[Taichi]
"Wha? Drinking? Liquor is forbidden!"

[Misato]
"It's fine. I'm 30, totally an adult."

[Taichi]
"It's still forbidden..."

[Misato]
"Even though it's non-alcohol?"

[Taichi]
"Non-alcohol... So not liquor?"

[Misato]
"Of course. If I drink I'll be expelled."

[Taichi]
"In this situation, rules and laws
really don't apply."

[Misato]
"No matter what happens there's an unchangeable rule.
And I'm bound to it. There's nothing to worry ab-"

*clank*
Behind me was the sound of material
and steel collapsing.

[Taichi]
"Almost hit you."

[Misato]
"Goodness... Could have been bad if I'd been working
over there."

[Taichi]
"Ah, but..."

[Misato]
"Ah!!"

The rebuilt antenna's materials had totally
collapsed.

[Taichi]
"You can't do this by yourself! Let me help."

[Misato]
"No thanks. This is my work. Pekke, just write the
script."
"I guess it is just stubbornness then?"

Even when I worked through the night,
the repairs didn't progress.
I would fix it and it would break again,
and the zero would turn into a minus.
Not efficient at all.

[Misato]
"I can't give up now... Everything starts in the
negative."

I woke up earlier the next day and started.

[Misato]
"An antenna worker's morning starts early. Even
while dawn hasn't broken, you're up making an
antenna on a rooftop."
"Well, I'm only doing this because I love it."

I was really happy this morning.
Even though a lot had broken, I was happy to work on
it again.
I was thinking of constructing it perfectly,
but that was impossible.
Bad materials and replacement parts...
No way of knowing if I could use them at all.
But I thought it was perfect for me.

[Taichi]
"Are you still working on this impossible task
alone?"

[Misato]
"It's not impossible...just..."

[Taichi]
"I brought someone to help us. The electric singing
talent, Miki Yamanobe."

[Miki]
"Yes, I'm the electric singing talent, Miki Yamanobe.
I destroy conversations with my bad jokes!"

[Taichi]
"Thanks for taking all the dirty jokes I make too!"
"The hallway is secure! Miki's going to help us with
wiring!"

[Miki]
"I never said I'd do that. Kiri! Help! I've been
abducted!"

[Misato]
"Pekke, would you please stop that?"

[Taichi]
"But, she's a broadcasting club member."

[Miki]
"Club President, I promised Kiri that I would take a
day off from club today!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, she disappeared!"

[Misato]
"Pekke, could you stop with the..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I was worried about you."

[Misato]
"I'm fine."

[Taichi]
"Sure you're not running away from something? Seems
like you're doing all of this to escape."

[Misato]
"Don't worry about me... I'm fine."

[Taichi]
"I see. I brought the script. Would you look at it?"

[Misato]
"You wrote it already? Wow. I'm impressed."

[Taichi]
"A masterpiece, a pearl among coral."

[Misato]
"Should you really say that about your own writing?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Misato]
"I'll have a look at this pearl."
"..."

[Taichi]
"What do you think?"

[Misato]
"Nope."

Pekke grabbed the script and ran away howling.
A few days later.
Pekke didn't come up to the rooftop, not even once.

[Misato]
"Looks like he's upset with me..."

I thought that at first, but soon found it wrong.
In the entrance to the rooftop, breakfast and food
had been set.
Lunch, sandwiches...
Curry rolls too.
I thanked Sakuraba.
I ate only a bite.
I found a box filled with vegetables
and food as well.
Was that from Tomoki? Or...maybe it was Pekke who
brought it.
That's why I was able to finally get through my work.
Finally, Sunday came.
The first transmission of the Gunjo Gakuin
Broadcasting Club.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"Pekke... It's almost afternoon."

[Taichi]
"Well, I came to say good morning anyway,
as someone in your field."

[Misato]
"What field is that?"

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm a newbie to broadcasting,
so I've changed to this field."

[Misato]
"Oh, thank you for that. I can't thank you enough."

[Taichi]
"You can thank me...physically."

[Misato]
"Ph-physically?!"

[Touko]
"What did you say? Die!"

[Taichi]
"Blaaarggg!"

[Misato]
"Looks like Touko's here too."

[Touko]
"He dragged me here..."

[Taichi]
"I offered her food."

[Touko]
"Die in a world with no resurrection!"

[Taichi]
"Blaaarggg again!"

[Miki]
"You two are so good together!"

[Misato]
"Miki and Kiri too!"

[Miki]
"We just came to watch."

[Kiri]
"I just...came with Miki..."

[Tomoki]
"You haven't started yet?"

[Misato]
"Tomoki..."

[Tomoki]
"I came to see what you were doing."

[Sakuraba]
"Don't be embarrassed. He came to see you."

[Tomoki]
"I didn't! I don't care about this."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you're here because you crave..."

[Sakuraba]
"Her attention!"

[Tomoki]
"I don't!"

[Touko]
"You idiots..."

[Misato]
"Wow, this is like old times... Only if Youko was
here..."

[Taichi]
"She's here."

[Misato]
"I can't see her..."

[Taichi]
"She's watching you from somewhere."

The fun club I always dream of...
It was all coming together now.

[Taichi]
"Let's begin the broadcast. I'll help with the set
up with these guys..."

[Misato]
"Well, to be honest..."

[All]
"You can't broadcast?!"

[Touko]
"What?"

[Miki]
"Too bad..."

[Misato]
"I didn't think it would be that important,
but I did try hard..."

[Tomoki]
"Thought so. You took it on yourself, and messed
up."

[Sakuraba]
"So you came here because you were worried about
your sister."

[Tomoki]
"That wasn't the reason why."

Anyway, it was the same as when we camped together.
I always was so stubborn about this.

[Taichi]
"Well, let's rehearse anyway!"

[Misato]
"Hm...?"

[Taichi]
"Just save the real broadcast for when the antenna's
fixed. I mean, we're all here now."

[Misato]
"But, I inconvenienced all of you..."

[Tomoki]
"No point in coming all the way here to do nothing."

[Touko]
"Whatever, let's just get it done."

[Taichi]
"Everyone's in agreement."

[Misato]
"Then you speak, Pekke. You...have the script,
right?"

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Misato]
"But if you don't...what will you talk about?"

[Taichi]
"We'll just improvise."

[Misato]
"No...we can't, we can't."
"This iiisss the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Blub..."

Messed up there... One more time.

[Misato]
"This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club.
We're rehearsing now."
"..."
"Let's see now... I have nothing to talk about."
"Ah, that's all."
"I guess we can't end with that...um...ummm... Yeah,
this is important so I guess we'll just keep going."
"From today, I was planning to have a real broadcast,
but it didn't work out."
"If I let the others help, it might have happened,
but I didn't."
"I tried to fix the broken antenna,
with my own power."
"It's my antenna. I abandoned it while making it,
and didn't let others help fix it, and when I tried,
it broke even more...so there's no broadcast."
"The broadcast club is my escape. I can forget about
things I hate. The work helps me forget. That's
what's happening."
"I was too caught up with the thought, a fantasy
that someone would hear my broadcast if I fixed the
antenna..."
"But, it wasn't just that. It was an escape. I was
running from Pekke and avoiding you guys..."
"I wanted to speak to others, desperately. But I
couldn't even communicate to you guys who were the
closest to me..."
"But finally now, I am able to speak. Even though
the antenna is broken, and I can't broadcast
anywhere, I can speak to you."
"Thanks guys..."
"So please help when you have time. We'll fix the
antenna, set up everything... By next Sunday, I want
the antenna to work."
"This has been the Gunjo Gakuin's Broadcasting Club.
Our first rehearsal is finished."
"See you next week."

[Taichi]
"You're doing it again next week?"

[Misato]
"Next week, you'll do it Pekke. I'm never doing it
again!"
