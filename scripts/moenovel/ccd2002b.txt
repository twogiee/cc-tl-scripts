[Touko]
"Hey Kurosu, you know, you have a lot of female
friends."

[Taichi]
"Huh? That's out of the blue."

[Touko]
"When I walked by your room today
I could hear everybody."

[Taichi]
"Oh. That."

[Touko]
"You're pretty popular."

We were just having some fun.

[Taichi]
"Why are you acting all weird?"

[Touko]
"I am not!"

She got mad.

[Taichi]
"We're just club mates... There were guys there too
you know?"

[Touko]
"It's not like I was able to see..."

[Taichi]
"There were a few there. But if I were really
popular don't you think I would have a girlfriend?"

[Touko]
"Y-you don't, huh...?"

[Taichi]
"If I did, I wouldn't always be talking to you."

[Touko]
"Hm...?"

This was progressing well.
We spent the afternoon in the club room.
There was a nice breeze, so it was a little cooler
than the classroom.

[Taichi]
"You know, I've been thinking..."

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Club was kinda hard until you started coming
along."

[Touko]
"..."

Touko had started to come along to club sometimes.

[Taichi]
"Thanks for coming."

[Touko]
"I was bored so I just stopped by."

[Taichi]
"You come along when nobody is here..."

[Touko]
"Only by chance."

[Taichi]
"Have a seat. I'll make some coffee.
It's cheap stuff though."

[Touko]
"...Okay."

I was experimenting with her.
How much could I affect people with my kindness?
How much could I deceive them?
If I knew this, I could decide how to live my life.
Would I be able to adapt?
I only imitated kindness and sympathy.
Was it possible to survive like that?
It took a lot of will power to be able to manipulate
people like that.
After all, I wasn't like other people.
I decided to not let it get to me.
I must not lose spirit in the face of my ugliness.
My underlying ugliness contributed to my self image
as a witch.
Just like the fairy tales of ugly witches from my
childhood.
Books about the severity of historical witch hunts,
they only confirmed the evil nature of such things.
My white hair, my devilish characteristics...
Even the brightness of my eyes.
There was no end to my worries.

[Taichi]
"Here's yours, Touko."

I handed her a cup of coffee.
I had told her it was cheap, but it was actually
Blue Mountain blend.

[Touko]
"Um..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"I'm going to call you Taichi."

I was a little surprised.
For the first time, I thought she was starting to
change from the person I had always known her as.

[Taichi]
"A little out of the blue, but sure."

[Touko]
"Well you keep calling me Touko.
It's not fair."
"So I'm doing it back."

She grinned and laughed.

[Taichi]
"Go right ahead."

I tried to force out a laugh.
...

[Taichi]
"What's this?"

[Touko]
"Oh, I made lunch."

[Taichi]
"Huh. You can do those kinds of domestic things?"

[Touko]
"Of course. Actually, I'm pretty good at
cooking."

[Taichi]
"Didn't you make too much?"

[Touko]
"Yeah...I made a lot...
Taichi, you can keep it for later."

[Taichi]
"Ah, okay..."

I was amazed.

[Touko]
"Is it good?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, it's really good."

[Touko]
"Wh-what...about the fried egg?"

[Taichi]
"Everything looks really nice but for some reason
the egg looks kinda weird."

[Touko]
"Um..."

Oh...
It looked important to her, so I chose my next words
carefully.

[Taichi]
"Um...but, yeah, it's the best thing in here."

[Touko]
"Really?!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. It's so good."
"I can tell you took care making it.
Mmm. So good."

It was actually the worst thing in the lunch.
It was just as bad as it looked.
That day repeated over and over again.
...
Time continued to pass.
Casual times.
Silly times.
Was it all worthless?
No.
I would always be able to think back on these times
with Touko at the school.

[Touko]
"Come on, walk me home... You promised."

We had reached a point where she would ask me to
take her home.

[Taichi]
"Sure, no problem."

The car's GPS was set.

[Taichi]
"Heheheheh."

I had taken the principal's Ferrari.
I had swiped the key from the principal's office.
I didn't really have good driving skills.
But I compensated for that with effort.
Over the days of these repeating weeks
I was able to master driving quickly.
I could probably drive Formula One now.
*vroom vroom vroom!*

[Taichi]
"Let's go."

[Touko]
"Feels like a date, heheh."

She got in the passenger seat.

[Taichi]
"Fasten your seatbelt."

[Touko]
"Oh, right..."

[Taichi]
"Let's go!"

...

[Touko]
"Maybe we shouldn't drive anymore..."

[Taichi]
"I guess not."

I just couldn't get the hang of it.
I had totaled the Ferrari.

[Taichi]
"It's a pretty hard car to drive. The steering wheel
is strange, and the clutch is heavy making it hard
to get into gear."

"And it starts to catch when you down shift... I
think it's defective."
Or maybe I just wasn't good at driving...
Anyway, I could just keep using cars and wrecking
them. It was a little messed up.
We headed towards Touko's mansion.
...

[Touko]
"When I packed my bags, I put a lot of thought into
what I should bring."
"Then I found some old photos."

She looked happy when she said this.

[Touko]
"I'm glad I didn't throw them away... I'm thinking
of sticking them up on the walls."
"I have enough to cover the walls from ceiling to
floor."

[Taichi]
"Aww."

[Touko]
"Heheh."

She latched on to my arm.
I took an item out of my tool bag and 'equipped' it.

[Taichi]
"Look at this, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"An armband?"

She looked at it closely.

[Touko]
"Love Birds... Anti..."
"Anti-Love Birds."

She read the slogan.

[Taichi]
"I take the influence of love birds on the
environment seriously. I work in a position of
regulation and restraint with a firm attitude."
"Let go of me!"

She shook me off.

[Touko]
"I-it's the same old thing... I have no idea what
you're talking about."

[Taichi]
"You should be careful about expressing excessive
affection in front of others."

[Touko]
"Others? There's nobody else..."

[Taichi]
"Or maybe there is..."

[Touko]
"Ugh..."

She was displeased.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, it's good that you're a backward type of
girl with a strong mind."

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"But if you get sweet it's too plain and ordinary!
Go forward boldly! Be strict when you're shy. It's
cute! It's for your own good."

[Touko]
"O-okay..."

[Taichi]
"You're like a precious gem."

[Touko]
*gasp*

[Taichi]
"The glow of that gem is even brighter than
diamonds... But alas, diamonds are carbon and will
burn in a fire."
"Goddamn. I guess that just shows how stupid it is
to put all your life's fortune into a diamonds."

[Touko]
"Hm???"

[Taichi]
"There are pros and cons. Please understand, my
lovely lady."

[Touko]
"I don't really understand, but okay."

[Taichi]
"So, are you on board?"

[Touko]
"Taichi, so you're embarrassed of being clingy in
front of people."

[Taichi]
"Pretty much."

I pulled her panties down.

[Touko]
"It's not right!"

[Taichi]
"I know!"

We used the big RV from Touko's house to return
home.
I crashed it along the way.
There was still a fair way to go.
There was another car parked close by. I pulled out
the keys.

[Touko]
"Wow... You're really prepared..."

[Taichi]
"Just lucky!"
"Ah! I'm so tired!"

[Touko]
"Thanks, for doing everything."

[Taichi]
"No problem."

[Touko]
"Want to take a cold bath together?"

[Taichi]
"As long as there's no fooling around."

[Touko]
"..."

She was expressionless but I wondered
what emotions swelled under the surface.

[Touko]
"I'll just go first, then."

[Taichi]
"Okay, go ahead."

Well then.
I searched her things.
I found the Harakiri.
I went into the garden.
I smashed it.
I replaced it with a cute carnation flower.
Flowers were a symbol of peace.

[Touko]
"That was refreshing."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, it was."

[Touko]
"You know, I'm all clean now..."

[Taichi]
"Here we go again."

A more straight approach than yesterday.
That's what meant about love birds...

[Touko]
"Surely can't hold out any longer? You are such
a perv, after all."

[Taichi]
"Actually, I became a poten."

[Touko]
"Poten...?"

[Taichi]
"It's an abbreviation of a German word. It's means a
man who can't do anything sexual. I'll find the
etymology and send it to you."

[Touko]
"..."
"You don't like me?"

[Taichi]
"I love you."

[Touko]
"Then why?"

[Taichi]
"Because I love you."

[Touko]
"Hm???"

Even one time would not be good.
I just had to keep enduring.

[Touko]
"Fine. I'm just going to clean up and go to bed."

Did she mean skin care or something like that?
Just like her.

[Taichi]
"Typical, you do always girly things."
"You have to keep up your girly appearance, don't
you?"

She reached for her sword.

[Taichi]
"Um... You had better not do that right now..."

[Touko]
"You...!"

My words didn't reach her at all.
It was like they just went right through her.
Then unsheathed her favorite sword.
*carnation*

[Touko]
"What have you done?!"

Arrrgggggh!
She convulsed.

[Touko]
"Aaaah! Aargh!"

Something came out of her mouth.
*Something = ectoplasm

[Taichi]
"This is bad!"

[Touko]
"Hrrrnnnn?!"

I held her down.

[Touko]
*huff huff huff*

She regained her composure.

[Touko]
"Why did you do it?!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, it would be illegal to have a blade like
that."

[Touko]
"If only you knew how much this sword meant to me.
It's like my heart and soul!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, yeah... I knew that..."

I spat the words out.

[Taichi]
"You don't need a weapon!"

[Touko]
"Oh... Ooooh... My precious sword..."

[Taichi]
"I'll make sure not to bring a new one."

Touko shrunk away and went to sleep.
Hey.
Come on.

[Touko]
"Taichi... I want to go to your place."

[Taichi]
"Sure, come by."

[Touko]
"So like, your house?"

[Taichi]
"I often stay at the dorm because of work,
so I don't go home often."
"I'm usually alone."

[Touko]
"Oh, I see... Well, I'll go next time."

The time had come.
For her confession.
...

[Touko]
"I...like you..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I know..."

Because I lured you in.
It was proof that I could get along in this world.
I had been successful.
On my experiments with Touko.
Or so I had thought.
But I had forgotten about the past.
Touko and I had been unable to control ourselves.
Our extreme decadence had led to destruction.
Touko and I had always been together.
Forever.
Our desires and actions had escalated.
Neither of us had wanted to stop.
It had continued on.
...
...
...
The change came suddenly.

[Touko]
"Don't talk to Miyasumi anymore..."

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

She watched and tried to read me.

[Taichi]
"It's not like we have anything going on."

[Touko]
"I don't like it. Stop. Be with me."

[Taichi]
"I am. I'm with you now."

[Touko]
"More..."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean...?"
"I'm in the club with Misato. How can I not talk to
her?"

[Touko]
"Quit the club."

[Taichi]
"I can't do that."

[Touko]
"Miyasumi is no good..."

[Taichi]
"Touko?"

This was dangerous.

[Touko]
"I wish she were gone."

She was dangerous.

[Taichi]
"Hey, pull yourself together."

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

She regained her composure.

[Taichi]
"Get it together. You were acting strange."

[Touko]
"Oh, I'm sorry..."
"Hehe... So is there anything else you'd like to do?"

It was a slippery slope.
We were heading to school as always.
However.
Touko seemed sullen.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"Hmph..."

She had her barrier up.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

She had been like that the whole morning.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"..."

It was no good.
Touko just went straight ahead alone.
I followed her.
I walked next to her.
She was acting all stuck up, and pretended to ignore
me.
In a way, she was beautiful, even like that.

[Taichi]
*yawn*

I spread my arms out wide.
*squish*
Then used one hand to grab her chest.

[Touko]
"Eeek!"

[Taichi]
"Girl, you've got no boobs!"

[Touko]
"Shut up!"

[Taichi]
"Princess!"

The gate was totally open.
Almost like it was opened for us.
I used to think of school as a prison.
But now it was like a sanctuary.
No one was here.
No one anywhere.
Just a school, just Gunjo Gakuin, a place to gather.
It used to be a place people were drawn to.
But now, with all the people being gone, it was
nothing.
Almost everyone was gone.
A slow disappointing death, but for me...it was
great.
Touko had even come to live with me.
Such irony.
She was in the classroom.

[Taichi]
"You grace us with your presence early today."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And out of uniform, as well..."
"Aren't you hot in those clothes?"

She ignored me.

[Taichi]
"All right, all right."

I shrugged, and sat down in the seat next to Touko.
I looked at the side of her face.
She acted like she was ignoring me.

[Taichi]
"Sorry about last night."

[Touko]
"You don't even care at all."

[Taichi]
"That's not true."

[Touko]
"Taichi...you're always the same."
"It's almost like you don't care about me."
"You always leave me alone, and do your own thing."

[Taichi]
"Jeez, I'm sorry."

[Touko]
"I just wanted to be beside you for a while."

[Taichi]
"That's why I came prepared."

[Touko]
"Prepared?"

I dropped some croquette rolls on her desk.

[Taichi]
"Here you are! Eat all that you need to!"

[Touko]
"Noooo!"

*rumble*
But her stomach was growling.

[Touko]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe it's roundworm."

[Touko]
"It is not!"

*rumble rumble*
Her stomach again.

[Taichi]
"Your stomach is growling."

[Touko]
"That's got nothing to do with this!"

[Taichi]
"You can't hide it. Your stomach is trying to
converse with you."

[Touko]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"It's telling you it's empty."
"My stomach's empty too."
"So for the first period class, why don't we eat
these croquette rolls."

I opened the pack and took one out.
I was happy that it wasn't rotten.

[Taichi]
"I guess we should make up too."
"It's about morals, you see..."

Touko looked bewildered.

[Touko]
"Hey, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"Taichi, you don't need me, do you?"

[Taichi]
"That's not true."

[Touko]
"Then...why don't you touch me?"
"I never said I didn't want to... You don't want to
live together do you?"

[Taichi]
"I don't want to corrupt you..."

I dug into the roll.

[Taichi]
"I'm not sure if I can really explain the
reasoning..."

[Touko]
"The reasoning...?"

[Taichi]
"Touko, do you have confidence you can look after
yourself?"

Especially under these circumstances.

[Touko]
"...What do you mean look after myself?"

[Taichi]
"Like, you know, something that you did in the past,
you know?"

[Touko]
"But, Taichi, I..."

[Taichi]
"No matter what, I would have never done that."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I really like you Touko."

[Touko]
"Then..."

[Taichi]
"But I've always liked you."
Sassy little Touko, fighting against the whole
world.
"But I see no way out for you."
"That's why it hasn't become love."

I didn't really care about that anyway.
Touko had to live her own life.
She needed the strength to fight.

[Touko]
"That's why...you stirred things up..."

[Taichi]
"Well..."
"I'm not good at depending on people,
or having people depend on me."
"I don't want you to get hurt."
"But I will help you keep things together
because I like you."
"It's just a simple thing like that."

[Touko]
"..."

She silently chewed on the bread.

[Touko]
*sniff*

Her eyes welled up with tears.

[Touko]
*sniff sniff* "Ahaa aah..."

For her to grow.
I went to the toilet.

[Taichi]
"Phew..."

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

Youko.

[Youko]
"Anti-Love Birds."

[Taichi]
"What...?"

[Youko]
"Like you, I'm Anti-love birds too."

[Taichi]
"Oh, okay."

She looked at me expressionless with resolution in
her eyes.

[Taichi]
"I understand what you are saying."
"You just came to say that?"

[Youko]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"However..."

What's with her?

[Taichi]
"Youko."

[Youko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"I love you. Can I kiss you?"

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

She coiled around me like a snake.
She sunk in her iron claws.

[Taichi]
"Hey, keep that to yourself!"

[Youko]
"Aaah... Ow... Ouch... Sorry. Sorry."

[Touko]
"Wha..."

How many times had we done this?
I sighed heavily.
My stomach felt heavy.

[Taichi]
"Hey, want to go to the beach?"

[Touko]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"Just the two of us. Tomorrow."

[Touko]
"But...Taichi... You don't like me."

She had been giving me the cold shoulder, but she
was warming up slowly.

[Taichi]
"That's not true."

I smiled at her.

[Taichi]
"You are always in good shape."

[Touko]
"Good shape..."
"What are you talking about Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Love is complex."

I should get an Oscar.

[Touko]
"Then let me ask... Do you like me?"

[Taichi]
"Of course!"

She smiled brightly with brilliant white teeth.

[Touko]
*sigh*

She melted.

[Touko]
"I don't really understand... Whatever."
"You told me you like me."

She said to me enthusiastically.

[Taichi]
"Too simple."

I turned away from the Touko and whispered to the
forest.

[Touko]
"I've come to like weird guys."

Touko stretched out happily.
She really was whimsical.

[Taichi]
"It's Friday, right?"

There was only three days until the world would
swing back.
There was much I should do today.

[Taichi]
"Saying that..."

I looked at the floor.
Touko was sleeping.
She had groaned in pain during the first night, but
she had soon gotten used to it.
She was in a deep sleep.
I was going to the beach with her today.
The beach had a great atmosphere.
I had to be cautious though.
If something sexual happened, it would be hard to
control myself.

[Taichi]
"I've gotta work hard."

We ended up fighting when I avoided bare skin
contact with her.
Touko got in a bad mood and went off on her own.

[Taichi]
"I don't want to deal with that..."

That...
The slippery slope.
...

[Taichi]
"I mean it, Touko."

I edged up to Touko.

[Taichi]
"Don't try to do that stuff...in front of everyone."

[Touko]
"That's not the problem!"

[Taichi]
"The problem?"

[Touko]
"I mean, even when it's just us...it should be ok,
right?"

[Taichi]
"Well...you know..."

She must have been frustrated, being unable to
express her affection.
Sometimes you see couples kissing on the train.
I had never thought that would happen to me.

[Touko]
"Even here should be ok..."

[Taichi]
"Um."

[Touko]
"But I'm a little embarrassed..."

[Taichi]
"Listen to me."

[Touko]
"I think everyone will understand."

[Taichi]
"You've been acting strange recently."

[Touko]
"You made me this way."

She laughed merrily.

[Taichi]
"..."

Then I realized.
Touko too had her reasons for being at Gunjo. We all
did. It was obvious.
Was it jealousy or insanity? I couldn't tell.
She was slowly becoming unmanageable.
I was the first to pull myself together.
It might get worse the next time.
It was best to take action before it was too late.
It was something we all knew about, but couldn't do
anything about it.
I decided to reset.
...
At night I touched Touko a little.
Just a little.
Shoulder to shoulder we gazed at the ocean.
She was still acting angry.
I could feel what was going on inside her.
I could understand her feelings.

[Taichi]
"Shall we retire?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm... For a rich girl, you're horrible at chess."

I stretched.

[Touko]
"Woof..."

I won, 10-0.
She was still in a bad mood after coming back from
the beach, so I decided to play a game with her.

[Taichi]
"Do you need dinner?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

She shook her head no.

[Taichi]
"Okay, let's go to bed."

I climbed into the comfy bed.

[Touko]
*whimper*

Touko lay down on the hard floor.
Silence crept upon us and settled in.
Was she asleep?

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

No response.
But before long.

[Touko]
"Hey, Taichi..."

She spoke with her back to me.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"I wonder if we'll always be together."

[Taichi]
"I'll always be in your heart..."

[Touko]
"Heheh, well then, I'm glad."

[Taichi]
"Why'd you ask, all of a sudden?"

[Touko]
"Well, everyone disappeared, right?
Maybe someday, we..."

[Taichi]
"..."

"We."

[Touko]
"If we have to disappear,
I just hope we can go together."

Her words faded out and she fell asleep.
I couldn't sleep for a while.
I couldn't stop thinking.
How long would it take for Touko to get herself
together once she was alone again.
I wondered if she could actually do it.
Regardless... It didn't change my decision.

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

My second apology was lost in the darkness.
Saturday was here.
One more day.
Only one more day.

[Taichi]
"Waahhh..."

I got up.

[Touko]
*zzz*

Touko was sleeping beside me.
Lightly breathing in her sleep.
She looked sound asleep.

[Taichi]
"..."

She must have snuck in next to me during the night.

[Touko]
*zzz*

She was sleeping peacefully.

[Taichi]
"...Heh."

She looked like a child sleeping.
Ok then.
I went out alone.
The air was really clear.
Not cool, but not warm.
Maybe things had calmed down.
There was no way to check for certain.
Regarding Touko, that is.

[Taichi]
"It's not like...I made any special memories or
anything."

I maintained a neutral position.
I spent a week keeping just the right distance.
Touko would become strong and independent.
Because of that...she wouldn't need to be reset.
Reset... Right, that was for my mistakes.
I had been wrong about her.
But I still felt apprehension, even now.
...
I decided to reset.
...

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

Initializing.

[Touko]
"What did you just say?"

Initializing.

[Touko]
"You're kidding, right?"
"You're always joking around, right?"

Initializing.

[Touko]
"What are you talking about, idiot."
"You won't fool me."
"..."
"Are you serious...?"

Initializing.

[Touko]
"Because you like me, right?"

Initializing.

[Touko]
"Hey... Come on..."
"Do you realize...what you're saying?"

Initializing.

[Touko]
"I definitely will...not allow it... I can't."
"I'll tell everyone! Everyone in the club!"
"And your family! The whole school!"
"I'll tell everyone what you did!"

Initializing.

[Touko]
"Taichi... Stop... I don't like that..."
"Hey, let's go shopping. I'll get you some clothes."
"Taichi...?"
"W-wait..."

Failed to initialize...
Then...

[Touko]
"Taichi... Look..."
"I'm hurt... Taichi... Ouch... Ow ow..."
"It hurts really bad. It feels like I might die..."
"I'm bleeding a lot..."
"So... be nice to me... Taichi..."
"Be nicer to me... Stay next to me..."
"Ow... Ouch..."
"Taichi... Come out...!"
"Look. Look at my blood... Looook."
"If you saw this, you would be nicer to me."
"Taichi, come out..."

If Youko hadn't come along...
Touko probably wouldn't have survived.
Touko eventually returned to school.
And just like before...
She became beautiful.
I found Touko's loneliness beautiful.
She hid her face.
Her blood had been a vivid red.
It was still burned into my retinas.
I liked it.
I liked her.
I had a kind of philosophy for this kind of thing.
Misato and Miki and Kiri...
I paid attention to those around me equally.
I liked Touko equally as well.
But it wasn't the kind of "like" she wanted.

[Taichi]
"Can't you hurry up and finish...?"

My heart grew impatient at the lack of results.
And tomorrow was Sunday...
When I woke, Touko was crying in her sleep.

[Touko]
*whimper*...*zzz*

She must have been sad.
I brushed the hair stuck to her forehead aside.
I couldn't satisfy everyone by myself.
It was before noon.
I had slept too long.

[Taichi]
"Touko. Touko."

I woke her.

[Touko]
"Hmm...?"

[Taichi]
"Wake up. We have to go."

[Touko]
"Hm?... Where to?"
"Where are you taking me?"

[Taichi]
"Somewhere good."

...

[Touko]
"Where am I...?"

[Taichi]
"Well."

Touko just stood there, perplexed.

[Taichi]
"..."

I stared at her.

[Touko]
"Hey... What's going on?"

[Taichi]
"I have a question. Please give me a straight
answer."

[Touko]
"S-sure..."

[Taichi]
"Are you lonely?"

[Touko]
"Um... I don't know, maybe..."

[Taichi]
"Are you sad there are no people?"

[Touko]
"Not so much sad as...it makes me feel uneasy."

[Taichi]
"Do you want to go home?"

[Touko]
"Of course..I wish I could go back to that time. Who
wouldn't?"
"What are you getting at?"

[Taichi]
"My next question."
"Why are you always lonely?"

[Touko]
"Why? I don't know how to answer that..."
"It's just... It's frustrating. Nobody talks to me."
"I have to be by myself..."
"But you talked to me, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry..."

All I could do was apologize.

[Taichi]
"Last question."
"Do you like me?"

[Touko]
"Um..."
"Yeah, I like you..."

And that was the last thing she said to me.
I felt those final words deep in my chest.
Okay.
So that's where we're at.

[Taichi]
"Make no mistake Touko."
"I'm not leaving you. I promise."
"Be well."

[Touko]
"Taichi, what are you trying to say...?"

*blink*
I closed my eyes.
I was the only one that could feel it coming.
I was the only one had control of it. What was here
and what was on the other side.
In the beginning I could have led everyone here.
I could've sent them over.
I opened my eyes and looked.
Touko was gone.

[Touko]
"What on Earth...?"
"Taichi?"
"Aaah?!"
"Hm...a radio? How did it get in my pocket?"
"How come I can hear you?"
"Oh no! Taichi! The radio!"
"Hey... Where are you?! Idiot!"
"Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"Farewell Touko."

And with that various possibilities vanished.
Touko would no longer be in the classroom.
She would no longer cut me down.
No more hanging on to each other.
No more being hit.
Everything connection we made...
It had all been cut off.
From now on, I would have to treasure my memories.
And use them to keep on living.

[Taichi]
"Don't feel so sorry for yourself."

Myself.
I push my fingers into my eyes.
I pushed down with all of my might.
I continued to push.
I still had so much to do.
See you next week...
