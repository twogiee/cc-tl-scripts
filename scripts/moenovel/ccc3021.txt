Touko's house was huge.
So big that it blocked the sunlight, casting only
shadows.
I thought I had good night vision, but for some
reason, I couldn't see anything.
But that didn't seem too strange compared to the
sudden vanishing of humanity.
I went inside.
Of course, there were armors and such around.
Which was what I assumed, but the windows were shut
so it was all dark.
I couldn't see like this, no matter how good my
vision was in the dark.
Loitered around in the mansion.
It was like a maze.
Wondered where Touko's room was.
Second floor, maybe.
Walked up the stairs.
It was like a mansion where zombies spawned out.

[Taichi]
"Touko!"

No response.
My voice got sucked in by the carpet.
I checked each room one by one.
Hah, such a hassle.
I regretted not bringing Youko with me.
After opening numerous doors...
A light shined in.

[Taichi]
"..."

The windows were fully opened.
The soft wind entered the room and left after
circling around.
That must be why.
It smelled so fresh.

[Taichi]
"Touko..."

I didn't think I could touch her.
Not because she was unpleasant.
But because it seemed so precious.
Made you think of sublime sleeping beauty.
Touko was alone at Gunjo.
She originally attended a private all-girls school.
But came here because of the adaptability exam.
Along with the whole mansion...
Adaptability was shown in percentages.
Touko was 46.
Not high or low for Gunjo.
If you were to look at it roughly, half of them were
normal.
Touko, in isolation, was covered with pride and
disgrace and...was beautiful.
Rejected conversation. Even with teachers.
She would come to school but refused to wear the
uniform, disassociated herself and rejected people.
Didn't entrust to anywhere and didn't flatter people.
But her heart swayed a craving for human
interaction.
Which was why I was so attracted.
And now, Touko was on the bed with her hands
together.
Did she put her hands together herself?
Did she go as she was falling asleep?
She must have.
It was a tragic end. Typically.
But I felt something else other than overwhelming
sadness.
I was deeply moved as I stood there.

[Taichi]
"I see..."

She passed by herself.
That Touko... By herself.

[Taichi]
"Good job... Touko."

Weakness, medicine, or from hunger?
I couldn't tell.
No need to disclose it.
What could be said was this.
Being embraced by a dome bed, Touko laid there
as if time had stopped, and gave a light feeling
of dream and reality. It was whimsical.
Blessed her.
I closed the door.
Walked alone in the dark.
I decided to leave the mansion.
I could see her again once it resets.
That fact ran through my head right before I left
the mansion.
The preciousness lost its light when repeated.
Such as her decision, loneliness, and strife.
I got irritated...
Like I had been disgraced.
Then, for what reason...
Did I push Touko away?
I was still irritated on the car ride back.
