I woke up.
The sunshine pierced through the window.
It seemed like I had slept soundly. I couldn't
recall a single dream.
The time was...seven o'clock.
Should head to school.
Miki was there.

[Taichi]
"Are you going to wait again today?"

[Miki]
"Ah, Taichi..."
"She won't come, I wonder if something happened?"

[Taichi]
"I've got a message from Kiri."

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri and Youko are going to check out the power
plant. They're tough!"

[Miki]
"With Hasekura...?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, and Youko's here as a guest today."

[Youko]
"..."

[Miki]
"It's been a while..."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Go ahead and talk."

I pushed Youko's back.

[Youko]
"I'm going to check the power plant with Kiri
Sakura. I won't let anyone get in our way."

She said as if she's informing an enemy.

[Miki]
"I-I see..."

She said so indifferently.

[Miki]
"So where is Kiri?"

[Taichi]
"She's already there."

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"So she can't see you, right Youko?"

[Youko]
"Yes..."

[Miki]
"Is that so..."

She was dispirited.

[Taichi]
"Good luck on the investigation."

[Youko]
"Okay..."

They gave a small bow to each other.
Youko's job was done.
...
And after Youko had left...

[Miki]
"Are you being honest about what Kiri said?"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

[Miki]
"Well, I'm glad she's still here."

She put her hands over her flat chest.

[Taichi]
"Hey, do you want to go somewhere refreshing and eat
some sweets?"

[Miki]
"Sweets?"

Her attitude changed.

[Taichi]
"Candy and gummy bears. Handmade."

Her attitude changed again.

[Miki]
"Handmade?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. By Youko."
"Reduced sugar, good for health and beauty.
These gummy bears are organic. No calories."

[Miki]
"No calories?!"

It was decided.
...

[Miki]
"It tastes like what mommy makes..."
"Wow, this is really good."

[Taichi]
"Good, good."

Miki was in a good mood because of the handmade
candies.

[Miki]
"Hasekura is full of mystery."

[Taichi]
"That's true."

[Miki]
"Are you lovers?"

[Taichi]
"No, we just lived together, that's it."

[Miki]
"Cohabitation?!"

[Taichi]
"No. It's nothing like that."
"Since we both had no parents, we were taken in by
the same household and grew up together."
"Ever since, we've been like siblings."

[Miki]
"Is that so..."

[Taichi]
"Now, here, take this candy. Let's suck them like
you would popsicles!"

[Miki]
"Yay! Candy!"

She smiled.
The day I spent with Miki was fun.
Just a pile of casual moments.
I knew the value of something more important than
first impressions.
There was only a little time left.

[Taichi]
"I wonder if I'm deceiving her again this time..."

But she would be together with Kiri when she gets
back.
Miki, you'll forgive me, right?
Miki from both worlds.
Wednesday came.
Went to school.
The gate to prevent escape.
Instead of protecting the students, it was more like
keeping us away from the outside world.
That was the impression it gave me.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Miki]
"Morning!"

[Taichi]
"If it was Kiri-"

[Miki]
"Uhm, that's not what I'm here for today."
"I was waiting for you."

[Taichi]
"Heheh, can I expect something from that?"

[Miki]
"I like you a lot but I've got zero affection for
you."

[Taichi]
"..."

Too far to reach.

[Miki]
"Hm?"
"Taichi, you smell kind of sour."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, it's my cologne with a sweat smell. It's
called Sweat du Mint."

[Miki]
"There's no way a cologne like that exists!"
"Have you taken a bath?"

[Taichi]
"Bath?"
"What bath? I'm a gentleman so I don't need to
bathe."

[Miki]
"Or just washing off with water."

[Taichi]
"It's a waste of water."

[Miki]
"Ugh... So, today is...?"

[Taichi]
"It's Wednesday, right? So I think it's been three
days."

I said in a stupid sounding tone.

[Miki]
"Wahoooo!"

She passed out.

[Taichi]
"Hey, are you okay?!"

I took my shirt off and leaned over her.

[Miki]
"Whoa whoa!"

She seriously resisted.
...

[Miki]
"I can't pass out so carelessly from now on..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, it was my first reflex."

[Miki]
"That's some dangerous reflex."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry. Not bathing doesn't result in dying."

[Miki]
"But I don't like Taichi that stinks."

[Taichi]
"Even if you say so..."

[Miki]
"Just, come with me."

She took me with her.
Miki grabbed a hose from the prefab.

[Miki]
"Taichi, take off your clothes."
"Including your pants."

[Taichi]
"Sure thing."

I stripped.

[Miki]
"Wh-what kind of underwear are you wearing..."

She blushed red.

[Taichi]
"I knew that this would happen!"
"So I tried to be faithful to the original."

I stood still on the rooftop with my elephant trunk
underwear.
She opened the valve to the hose.

[Miki]
"Here we go!"

Water burst from the hose and struck me full on.

[Taichi]
"Gpft!"

[Miki]
"Take it!"

There was a sickly smell of citrus mint.
I was doused with body soap.
And what more, a complete bottle of it.
...Was I really that smelly?

[Miki]
"Come on, scrub yourself!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, yeah..."

[Miki]
"I'll be holding the hose, so be devoted to cleaning
yourself."

[Taichi]
"I just wanted to be like unwashed rice..."

[Miki]
"Here we go!"

The water squirted forth like an angry cat.
Just as I thought, Miki turned out to be a promising
rookie that I had anticipated.

[Taichi]
"When paired with Kiri, you were all lovey-dovey at
the pool... But now that you're paired with me,
you're treating me like a slug! Ugh!"

[Miki]
"..."

But the water did feel good.
I felt so clean.
I even washed my privates so as not to interfere
with ethical standards.

[Miki]
"Are you clean now?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I am."
"The most important part of my body is almost
thoroughly rinsed away."

[Miki]
"That's really great!"

[Taichi]
"I-Is that so... I feel like my heart's completely
missing..."

[Miki]
"Well, if it makes you pure, Taichi..."

Miki's eyes looked scary.

[Miki]
"I've got nothing to object about that!"

Was she really putting so much attention to it?!
No good!
Would the best part of me be scraped off because of
Miki's desires for purity?

[Taichi]
"No, stop it!"

[Miki]
"Spray it off!"

[Taichi]
"Don't get too into it!"

[Miki]
"Yaaaaah!"

[Taichi]
"Gyaaaaah!"

Noooooooooooo!!
Five minutes later.

[Miki]
"You calmed down."
"H-how do you feel? Clean and spotless?"

I raised my head.
I smiled at Miki, my junior.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, thanks to you."

[Miki]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"I feel so immaculate. I am very happy. I want to
thank you Miki from the bottom of my heart."

[Miki]
"Immaculate? Bottom of your heart?!"

What a refreshing feeling.
I changed to an honest, good citizen.
I'll never hurt anyone again.

[Miki]
"Uhm, I want to ask you something."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Miki]
"1. Do you feel like flipping skirts?"

I furrowed my eyebrows.

[Taichi]
"Nobody should do that."

[Miki]
"Ooooh."
"2. How about touching boobs or butts?"

[Taichi]
"That's sexual harassment! The worst type of man.
While I'm alive, I'd never allow myself to do that!"

[Miki]
"That sounded like what an American hero would
say..."
"3. Opinion about war?"

I hung my head in sadness.

[Taichi]
"Humanity's sin... But I believe that humanity will
overcome it in the future!"

[Miki]
"Wonderful..."
"I...I can trust you."

[Taichi]
"Thanks. I'll work hard not to betray your trust."
"Alright, Miki. Spray a little more water on me. I
want my body and heart to be cleaner. I want to
become the justice itself!"

[Miki]
"R-roger!"

The water hit me again.
My heart turned white with purity.
My body, as well.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

That reminded me I was still wearing underwear.

[Taichi]
"Well, I guess I should clean down here too."

I felt that of all places, that area should get
purified.
So I took my elephant underwear off.
Since it was a really fitted one, I needed some
strength, just like how you pull off your rubber
gloves.

[Taichi]
"Here we go!"

[Miki]
"Wha, stooooooop! Not in front of a virgin like me!"

[Taichi]
"Gah?!"

[Miki]
"You're still a perv!"

The water sprayed on my face was on full blast, just
like how she shouted on full blast that I was a
perv.

[Taichi]
"Awwwww..."

[Miki]
"Ah, sorry... Are you okay?"

[Taichi]
"Hey Miki! You're wearing a really short skirt
today!"

[Miki]
"Whaa?"

[Taichi]
"Looking at a girl's miniskirt, so irresistible!
Heheheh!"

[Miki]
"Why are you back to being a perv?!"

Miki ran away.

[Taichi]
"Hey hey!"
"What the hell..."
"Whoa, am I naked?"
"What the hell..."

I lay on my back and looked at the sky.
Miki didn't come back.
I reminisced.
The first day I met Miki.
I think I was the first in Gunjo to greet Miki.
She was a lovely lamb driven from her old flock
to a new one in Gunjo.
Day one.
She didn't bring her lunch with her...was what she
said.
I instantly went to find Miki when I got that
information from Miki's classmate, Miyuki.
I pretended it was a coincidence and used it as the
backdrop for our meeting.
At the sealed main gate where it prevented Gunjo to
cause any trouble to the neighbors.
Miki was standing still there.
You could say it was a pattern among new transfers.

[Taichi]
"Hi!"

[Miki]
"Huh...?"

And various stuff happened.

[Miki]
"Pfft."

She smiled a little.

[Miki]
"Weirdo..."

She loosened up a bit.

[Taichi]
"I'll just eat it all myself then!"

[Kiri]
"W-what do you think you're doing?!"

I quarreled with Kiri, who had the same intention as
me.

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah...you guys..."

Miki watched us fight with a complicated expression.
No matter how long I waited, Miki didn't come back.

[Taichi]
"Can't be helped..."

I felt depressed.
I wanted to get some air.
Without Misato on the rooftop, it was a deserted,
lonely place.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

I was lying down with arms and legs spread.
I could feel the wind on my skin.
I wished I could be blown away like a feather but
humans are heavy, so it's impossible.
It wasn't like liberation would come.
Humans were made this way to be aware of their
weight of life.

[Taichi]
"I have to go search for Miki, but..."

I closed my eyes and my consciousness blurred.
I felt strange, and opened them.

[Taichi]
"Miki...?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

She smiled.

[Miki]
"It's Miki."

Her eyes were bloodshot.
Did something happen?

[Miki]
"Oh, just sleep."

[Taichi]
"Can I put my head on your thighs?"

[Miki]
"As long as you don't try anything dirty."

[Taichi]
"If I do?"

[Miki]
"It depends on the extent of the sexual harassment."
"I'll break ties with you..."

[Taichi]
"That's scary. I can't do anything."

[Miki]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, very scary... If that happens, it's like 100
mega shocks!"

[Miki]
"That so? Well then, you can put your head on my
thighs."
"I was surprised. You looked passed out."

[Taichi]
"I was asleep."

[Miki]
"Just another crazy day."
"But when crazy things happen, you're the best."

[Taichi]
"Really...?"

[Miki]
"You're weird but interesting, everyday is like a
festival."

Tears.
I couldn't react when I saw her crying above my
face.

[Taichi]
"Miki...?"

[Miki]
"But the more time I spend with you, the more I feel
so unsatisfied... Kiri's not here... Parents,
friends and everyone else..."
"We lost the normal days..." *sniff*

[Taichi]
"Not a thing changed even when you spent time with
me... It can't be helped..."

[Miki]
"That's not what I mean though..."
"I don't have any self-confidence."

[Taichi]
"For what?"

[Miki]
"The self-confidence...to live."

[Taichi]
"Don't say that. Trust yourself."

[Miki]
"Sniff... I can't..."
"Kiri is gone, right?"

[Taichi]
"How...?"

[Miki]
"I just know..."
"I mean, others are gone, so it's the only thing you
can think of."
"Everyone disappeared."
"So Kiri disappeared too."
"Are we going to disappear too someday?"
"Disappear and be gone for good?"

[Taichi]
"Possibly..."

[Miki]
"See, hahah... Even you admitted it..."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Miki. Everyone dies in the end."
"Are you saying that just because you'll die
someday, you're gonna abandon the fact that you're
alive right now?"

[Miki]
"That's..."

[Taichi]
"It doesn't matter if we disappear. But why not live
until we do?"
"There are a lot of fun things you can do."

[Miki]
"Like what?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."
"You want to live with me?"

[Miki]
"With you?"
"Are you asking me out?"

[Taichi]
"I can buy you whatever you want."

I said it as a joke, but Miki looked at me as if I
was hiding something from her.

[Miki]
"Are you going to try dirty stuff with me?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Miki]
"Uh..."

[Taichi]
"Dirty stuff, I definitely will. It's an attitude of
those who believe in their own existence."
"The moment you cross the threshold of my house, you
will be the same as a non-virgin."

[Miki]
"That fast, huh..."

She sounded a bit fed up.

[Taichi]
"Kind of like Schrodinger's cat, you'll be a virgin
and non-virgin simultaneously."

And then I suddenly felt really sleepy.

[Taichi]
"Unh..."

[Miki]
"I'll think about it."
"Oh...he's asleep! That was fast."
"Jeez..."
"Really, what a weirdo."
"Hahahah."
"Ahahah..."

...
When I awoke, Miki was smiling.

[Taichi]
"Did I sleep again?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, a bit."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I was tired. I'll get up."

[Miki]
"Before that..."

She pushed me back down.

[Miki]
"I have to give thanks."

[Taichi]
"Thank me?"

[Miki]
"Thank you for cheering me up."

[Taichi]
"Well, then, with that body..."

[Miki]
"No, I was thinking of picking your ears clean."

[Taichi]
"Hn?!"
"I'm getting up!"

[Miki]
"No!"

[Taichi]
"This isn't good!"

[Miki]
"Hyaaa!"

She stuck it into my ear.
*squish*

[Taichi]
"Hngg!"

Then I went to visit hell.
And in the end, Miki didn't come to my house.

[Taichi]
"It's Friday..."

Only three days until the world loops back.
I should do what I could today too.

[Taichi]
"Oops, I should go to the beach."

I forgot to prepare yesterday, but it'll do.

[Taichi]
"Let's go to the beach!"

[Miki]
"...Huh?"

I gathered the essentials from Atomic Shop...
Packed the car...
And headed to the ocean.

[Taichi]
"Now this is the ocean I'm talking about!"

I struck a proud pose.

[Taichi]
"And!"

[Miki]
"Fast...it all happened so fast."

[Taichi]
"It's going to get even faster!"

[Miki]
"Yeah, you're excited."

[Taichi]
"Okay, let's have fun!"
"Whoa!"

[Miki]
"Hiyah!"

[Taichi]
"There!"

[Miki]
"Weheee!"

We enjoyed swimming and playing sepak takraw.
Lunchtime came.

[Taichi]
"Phew! I swam so much that I'm all worn out!"

[Miki]
"Instead of having fun, it felt like getting our
strength squeezed out."

[Taichi]
"I guess we failed at having fun then."

[Miki]
"Moving by swimming... It's ridiculous. It's made
for mermaids to do."

[Taichi]
"We teenagers are insane."
"Alright, let's see if it's ready."

[Miki]
"It's ready."

We leaned on the cheap table we brought and stared
at the meal we prepared.
Instant noodles.

[Taichi]
"Slurrrrrrp."

[Miki]
"Hot hot hot!"

[Taichi]
"I thought it's best for us to have noodles by the
ocean, but... It's so lonely."

[Miki]
"Right..."

[Taichi]
"Yours looks really delicious."

[Miki]
"Curry flavor."

[Taichi]
"Let me try."

[Miki]
"Sure, go ahead."

[Taichi]
"Ah, it is good. Do we have another one of those?"

[Miki]
"I just stuck some in the bag. Look and see."

There were quite a few, but they were broken from
the impact.

[Taichi]
"If you think about it, we didn't need that many."

[Miki]
"Don't forget that they saved my life."

We had an accident on the way.
"Y-Y-YOUR DRIVING SUCKSSSS
~~III"
She scolded me while crying.

[Taichi]
"Yes...sorry."

[Miki]
"Ahh, alright."

I made another cup of instant noodles and started to
eat.
On our last days, I was chilling and eating instant
noodles.

[Miki]
"By the way, did you notice?"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Miki]
"The fish and jellyfish, all of them gone from the
ocean."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I did. No living clams...just shells."

[Miki]
"I picked up a beautiful shell! I'm taking it home."

[Taichi]
"The gigantic octopus wasn't there either."

[Miki]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"Well, don't worry too much about it. Science is
dead anyway."

[Miki]
"Well, the world has become very lonely."
"I didn't notice before how lonely..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

The world is lonely.
She was right.

[Miki]
"Do you really think we just have to keep living in
this world...?"

[Taichi]
"Are you lonely?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Let's make lots of kids, then."

[Miki]
"Do whatever you want."

Half disgusted, half resigned.

[Taichi]
"Yay!"

She gave me the permission, so that meant I'd make
tons of babies with her.

[Taichi]
"I won't do it, though."

[Miki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"Let's just keep having fun."

[Miki]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"Next is night wrestling."

[Miki]
"I'm not sure if you're toying me or not..."
"That was so much fun!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, we should go again!"

[Miki]
"Okay!"

It seemed like she got her energy back.

[Taichi]
"Oh hey, remember the pictures you took today?
Will they take long to develop?"

[Miki]
"Do you want them soon?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, by tomorrow night if you can."

[Miki]
"That's pretty soon... Well, I can develop them
at school and give them to you there."

[Taichi]
"Thanks. See ya later!"

[Miki]
"Oh..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"Never mind, it's nothing"

She ran off towards the apartment buildings.
Saturday came.
One more day.
Only one more day left.

[Miki]
"Good morning, you're early today."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I want the photos."

[Miki]
"I'm going to develop it. It will take some time."

[Taichi]
"Sure, take all you want."

[Miki]
"Could you come with me?"

[Taichi]
"Ah...I wanted to relax here."

[Miki]
"Sure..."

She looked down.

[Miki]
"Let's eat lunch together."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

Miki left.
I thought about this weekend.
Inevitable.
I should just send her back safely.
I remembered each and every conversation I had with
Miki.

[Taichi]
"I guess I should go."

I went to the photography room.

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

[Miki]
"Excuse me."

She came.
With a large bag.
She smelled like soap.
With a new uniform.
This can't be...

[Miki]
"You give off a strange...vibe."

[Taichi]
"Well, that's rude."

[Miki]
"This is a small hotel, manager."

[Taichi]
"What, this is the best place for those with
agoraphobia."

[Miki]
"Even so, it's bigger than my place."

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Miki]
"Wow, such nice flooring."

[Taichi]
"It's normal in this town. Everyone has money."

[Miki]
"Well, I live in an apartment building that's been
there since poorer times."

[Taichi]
"Oh...the abandoned one."

[Miki]
"There's no elevator, so there's no problem at all
even if the electricity goes down!"

[Taichi]
"What floor are you on, Miki?"

[Miki]
"...The top one."

[Taichi]
"Go ahead and cry...I know I would."

[Miki]
"Waaaah! Now I don't need to climb up those stairs!"

[Taichi]
"Pitiful..."

[Miki]
"Well, thank you for your sympathy. Now please show
me my room!"

[Taichi]
"Here it is."

[Miki]
"It's your room!"

[Taichi]
"When you come to a guy's house, it means that..."

[Miki]
"Yeah, yeah. I know..."

[Taichi]
"Honesty is the best policy."

[Miki]
"Taichi, can I ask you one more question?"

[Taichi]
"All right."

[Miki]
"What's in the next room?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, you can't go there."
"Well, you want to see it?"

[Miki]
"Yes?"

I let her go.
She came back blushing.

[Miki]
"There's a w-w-wall full of your pictures!"

[Taichi]
"Scary, right?"

[Miki]
"Rough to look at."

[Taichi]
"You can look, but no touching."
"So, the floor of this room will be where you
sleep."
"Here's a sleeping bag."

Miki stared at the bundled up sleeping bag.

[Miki]
"What are you thinking, making a girl to sleep in a
sleeping bag like this?"

[Taichi]
"It's protocol for the guests to sleep on the
floor."
"If you want to sleep in my bed, you better be
prepared to overcome the 100 trials of Taichi
Kurosu!"

[Miki]
"..."

She looked worried.

[Taichi]
"Hey hey!"

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna mess with you!"

She looked up at me...

[Miki]
"Go ahead."
"I'm prepared."

She looked serious, and it surprised me.

[Taichi]
"Uhh, you don't have to say that. I was just
joking."
"Are you scared or something?"

[Miki]
"I am scared."

[Taichi]
"Right?"

Miki turned her head left and right.

[Miki]
"No one around. It scares me."

[Taichi]
"Oh, THAT'S what's scary."

[Miki]
"What about Kiri? Why is she gone?"

[Taichi]
"We don't really know"

[Miki]
"Will I disappear? And you?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"It makes you go crazy."
"Hold me, Taichi..."
"...So that I won't disappear."

She said as she leaned against me.
I had to let her lean on me.
I could have endured if it wasn't night time.
But the atmosphere that enveloped us was of
something we couldn't refuse anymore.

[Taichi]
"Hold you, huh..."

She began to cling to me as I lightly touched her
back.
She held me tight.
We became one.
I realized that this was the last memory I could
make with Miki.
This again...
Became another memory.
I laid Miki softly on her side.
...
...
...

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"..."

She was sleeping.

[Taichi]
"Hahah."

The carefree one.
She was sleeping soundly.
On the floor.
She seemed a bit pitiful.
So I moved her to my bed.
Closed all the windows.
Held her.
And slept.

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

I knew.
She was small and warm.
That's what Miki was.

[Miki]
"Huh? Picnic?"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

Sunday.
I suggested it while we were eating breakfast.

[Miki]
"Well, it's Sunday."

[Taichi]
"I've already prepared."

[Miki]
"Really? That's fast."

She stared intently into the basket.

[Miki]
"Hm? So is that for a perv-picnic?"

Then she laughed.

[Taichi]
"You guessed it."

[Miki]
"Wow, you really are the worst."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean? Not like there are other things
to do."

[Miki]
"If you only possessed some romantic attribute..."

[Taichi]
"You can't survive on romance."

[Miki]
"That's a plain way of putting it."

[Taichi]
"Well, let's go. I'll bring the toys and the
costumes."

[Miki]
"What are you planning to do to me?"
"Not to say, on a mountain too?"

[Taichi]
"Who knows?"

[Miki]
"Uhh..."
"And? What are you going to do to me?"

[Taichi]
"You'll see when we get there. It's a place no one
has ever discovered."

[Miki]
"Waaah."

Maybe she was already accustomed of how psychedelic
I was, but she still followed me without suspicion.

[Taichi]
"You have parents, right Miki?"

[Miki]
"I do."
"Poor parents."
"I mean, I did."

Past tense.

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry."

[Miki]
"Well, no one else is here, so we're all the same."

[Taichi]
"Poor parents."

[Miki]
"My allowance was low too."

[Taichi]
"How much?"

[Miki]
"$30."

Whoa.
That's cheap.

[Taichi]
"You can't buy anything with that."

[Miki]
"It's important to save it."
"And then New Year's money."
"When we were told I was going to Gunjo, they got me
a whole bunch of nice stuff."
"I wonder what all that meant!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

Better not to know at all.

[Taichi]
"Well, either way, it's important to save
something."

[Miki]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"We're here."

[Miki]
"...Shrine."

[Taichi]
"Over here."

[Miki]
"Are we really going to do it here? Can't I refuse?"

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Miki]
"Ahhhh..."

[Taichi]
"Go hold the radio."

[Miki]
"What kind of game is this?"

[Taichi]
"What? It's for you to know the situation once you
go to the other side."

[Miki]
"Hm???"

[Taichi]
"Walk here, slowly and straight."

[Miki]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Here, here."

[Miki]
"I'm not sure if I'm getting what you're saying..."

[Taichi]
"Just walk."

[Miki]
"O-okay..."

Good.

[Taichi]
"Stop. Don't move."
"Okay, now pose for me."

[Miki]
"What kind?"

[Taichi]
"Make something up."

[Miki]
"I can't do that...what should I do?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

[Miki]
"Something like this?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"Umm...?"

[Taichi]
"Alright, I burned it into my memory."

[Miki]
"What's gonna happen..."

[Taichi]
"Miki, I'm going to make a prediction."
"In the near future, you're going to be a tough guy."

[Miki]
"So wait, I'm getting a sex change?"

[Taichi]
"You'll become a good woman."

[Miki]
"Whoa."

[Taichi]
"You'll get experience. You'll become something
great, if you ask me."
"The letter X is made by an intersection!"

[Miki]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"What, you don't get it? I just said something
emotional."

[Miki]
"An intersection? You mean crossing paths
without meeting?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, don't say that! You're messing up the point!"

[Miki]
"Ahaha."
"Taichi, you're too deep I can't understand you."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

[Miki]
"My first impression of you was weird, and it's
still the same impression I have now."

[Taichi]
"I guess I never really developed."

[Miki]
"Well, I'm also someone who got paired with you."

[Taichi]
"Yeah. So you should give birth to a good child."
"Well, it's too bad I couldn't teach you some
dazzling things on my bed!"

Really, it was too bad.
I mean, extremely bad.
I regretted it.

[Miki]
"Uhm, what are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"See ya."

I waved.

[Miki]
"Umm..."

[Taichi]
"Hey, raise your hands."

[Miki]
"Okay, but..."

[Taichi]
"Now smile."

[Miki]
"If feels like..."
"It feels like a good bye!"

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Miki]
"It's strange...Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Maybe I wanted to have a sister, or a daughter like
you, Miki."

Miki's eyes opened wide.
And then...
The sky darkened.

[Taichi]
"It was really fun. See you."

[Miki]
"Taichi! No!"

*blink*
She was gone before she could move.
She had been sent back.

[Miki]
"Wha...huh?"
"Taichi! Taichi!"
"Huh...?"
"Whaaaa?"
"He's gone! In a second!"
"Where did you go, Taichi?"
"Wait, the radio works?"
"What does this mean..."
"If the radio works, there's transmission... Which
means..."
"Oh..."
"City lights."
"There are...people."
"Whoa, this is nuts!"
"Taichi, there are people and radio and city lights!"
"He's gone... Where did he...?"
"I'll go ahead of you then!"

I was all alone.
From this world, another soul had departed.
Even so.

[Taichi]
"She made it, I guess."

The last instant.
Why did she scream "no" at me? What did she meant by
it?
She shouldn't had any idea that something was
happening...
Maybe she was trying to tell me something.
That was what I thought...
