[Misato]
"L-let's calm down for now, all right?"

[Taichi]
"No. Once a man comes this far, he can't stop."

[Misato]
"Oh, gosh..."

[Taichi]
"That time."

[Misato]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"In first year, when I was by myself."
"You really listened up to what I was saying at the
rooftop."

[Misato]
"That's because...I just happened to be in the same
place..."

[Taichi]
"You saved me from the darkness, Misato."
"I didn't really make it into the broadcasting club,
did I?"
"Because my adaptation score is too high..."
"But still, you invited me anyway."
"You personally took matters into your own hands to
make sure I could join the club."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I know, I looked into it."

[Misato]
"That's because...I thought you looked lonely by
yourself... So through healthy club activities..."

She distanced herself as I got closer.
But I edged even closer.

[Taichi]
"If you reach out to people...you can have
relationships."
"You get thanked, and feel warm and fuzzy."
"It's only normal that I want to get closer to you,
Misato."

I reached out to her.
The tip of my finger touched her lips.
I grabbed her wrists.

[Misato]
"But I'm not..."

[Taichi]
"Then... Are you turning me down?"
"Do you want to take me back to my old darkness?"
"Even if you do so...I won't force you."

[Misato]
"That's not making it easy for me..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I'm sly."
"I'm sly..."

My finger dropped from her lips to her neck then
stopped.

[Taichi]
"..."

I could even undo her buttons, but my hard-on was
stopping me.
Emotions of hesitation.
It would be a rare opportunity of a lifetime.
I changed my mind and gave everything up.

[Taichi]
"Let's greet each other."

[Misato]
"Greet?"

I made my move before she tried to question me any
further.

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

We touched for a split second.
Then I moved away.

[Taichi]
"A foreigner's type of greeting."

It wasn't usually on the lips.

[Misato]
"..."

Misato had frozen.

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

[Misato]
"Uh..."

[Taichi]
"Uh?"

[Misato]
"Ughh..."

She stood still.
Then fainted.

[Taichi]
"M-Misato?!"

She was already breathing lightly, asleep.
She had fainted.

[Misato]
"Hn..."

One hour.
That was how long she slept for.
I was watching the whole time.

[Misato]
"Oh... Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Misato]
"Oh... I must have just slept..."

Then it suddenly hit her.

[Misato]
"But why did I?"

[Taichi]
"Probably because of my safety ability."

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind, it's nothing."

It was like my memories were flying.
I couldn't touch them, but maybe that was a
good sign.

[Taichi]
"Are you okay?"

[Misato]
"I'm so embarrassed... I must have been tired."

[Taichi]
"Well there's nothing you can do about that."

Of course.

[Taichi]
"Just wait a bit."

I went downstairs and came back.

[Taichi]
"Here you are."

A popsicle. Hand-made.

[Misato]
"Wow..."
"Thank you."

We both bit into the popsicles.

[Misato]
"It's cold. Yummy."

Okay.
She didn't seem angry.

[Misato]
"Umm... So what were we talking about?"

[Taichi]
"Whether we should go to the beach tomorrow."

[Misato]
"Is that really what we were talking about...?"

[Taichi]
"You just about fell asleep then."

[Misato]
"Ahh, I hate myself for doing that."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Misato."

[Misato]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Do you want to go to the beach tomorrow?"

[Misato]
"The beach?"

[Taichi]
"Just the two of us."

[Misato]
"Right..."

It looked like she was thinking about club
activities.

[Taichi]
"You need a break every now and then, too."

[Misato]
"Hmmm... Let's see."
"Then let's just take tomorrow off."

Looking shy now, are we...?
She looked overwhelmed and confused.
She didn't seem to get it.
I'm sure things wouldn't change even if we had sex.
It's not even something to get so caught up in.
Now what was I supposed to do?
For now, all I could see was the darkness.
