Well then.
Just left the club activities to the others.
Now, time to pick up Touko.
I decided to use the car.
Looked for car keys that matched the car
from the teacher's lounge.

[Taichi]
"Whoa..."

The parking lot was a disaster.
It almost seemed like a street gang
did a hit-and-run over and over again.

[Taichi]
"They're all dented..."

This one was even missing a bumper.
A tree had fallen.
The front radiator had a crack in it.

[Taichi]
"Professor Tomoki..."

Tomoki had a divine talent for bad driving.

[Taichi]
"I guess that amateur couldn't drive manual cars,
heheheh."

Opposed to him, I knew how to drive.
Just a difference in status for a human being.
Got inside the car with the right key.
A man drove manuals.
But the car was automatic.
Must be a car for a woman.

[Taichi]
"Heh, I'll show you!"

I was wild.
On my high horse.
Released the clutch half-way and pedaled the gas.
Oh no, I hit the car in front of me.
I sure was glad I was wearing a seatbelt.
Reversed a bit.

[Taichi]
"Back it up, back it up..."

Ran over the tire block and hit the tree shrubs.

[Taichi]
"This ain't good."

That was a one-in-a-million kind of mistake.
A super rare event.
Retry.
Shoot, the gear was still in reverse.
What's a million times a million...?
Oh well.
It was an miraculous event.
It looked like an expensive car too...
Sorry Mr. Sakabihara, rest in peace.
Went forward.
Oh wow wow, the e-brake was still on.
Took it off.
Boom, the car suddenly accelerated.
Tore off the bumpers of each car as the car grazed
the front of each vehicle.
I was fairly efficiently destroying them.
Oh man, the principal's Ferrari wasn't looking too
hot.

[Taichi]
"..."

Oh well. It's his fault for driving a Ferrari at
such a dangerous school.
Moved forward slowly. Turned right.

[Taichi]
"Good."

Stalled the car.

[Taichi]
"..."

Restarted.
Reversed.

[Taichi]
"..."

I often thought about it, but seat-belts were a
necessity.

[Taichi]
"And off we go!"

The car stopped working.

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

The biorhythm must be in poor condition.

[Taichi]
"Japanese cars are pretty frail."

To be assigned a car like this would be the dream
come true for the western police.
The most it could do was to get destroyed by a water
truck.
Youko was banging on the window.

[Taichi]
"What?"

Opened the window.

[Youko]
"Hop out."

I hopped out.

[Youko]
"Wait here."

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

Walked around in circles and waited. A car pulled up
from afar.
With flawless maneuvering, it stopped in front of me.

[Youko]
"Hop in."

Got in the passenger seat.

[Youko]
"Where do you want to go?"

[Taichi]
"To Kirihara Palace, please."

She drove me there.
I became so sorrowful.
