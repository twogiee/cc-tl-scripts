[Taichi]
"You're early."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And out of uniform, as well..."

School regulations were virtually nonexistent
at Gunjo.
Commit any kind of offense, and security would
handle it.
There was no need for students to regulate
themselves.
That's why the rule that you had to wear school
uniforms didn't make any sense.
Even at the prestigious Gunjo, they weren't going
to tear the clothes off of a girl her age and force
her into a uniform.
It was about separating herself from others.
That was undoubtedly Touko's determination
to resist.

[Taichi]
"Though I'd just love to see that body in uniform."

[Touko]
"..."

Hmm.
It was rare that disregard suited a character
so well.
It made Touko extremely picturesque.
I sat next to her and took in the profile of
her face.
I felt insatiable lust the whole time.

[Taichi]

[Touko]

[Touko]

[Touko]

[Taichi]

[Touko]
"What do you want?!"

She suddenly stood up.

[Taichi]
"Hey! Portraits aren't supposed to talk!"

[Touko]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"Just be beautiful."

[Touko]
"I don't get you at all!"

[Taichi]
"You've got a strange inflection that makes you
sound like an old lady. The more you talk, the worse
you look."

[Touko]
"Whaaaat did you just say?!"

That hit a nerve.
"Whaaaat," she said.
It was the verbal downfall of art.

[Taichi]
"Hmph. You're no fun."

I tried to shrug my shoulders as if the high-handed
notion of world justice had been achieved and
Americans had been eradicated once and for all.

[Taichi]
"Your second name will be the Destroyer of Art."

[Touko]
"I don't need a second name!!"

[Taichi]
"That's great. Picasso said the same, you know. Once
again you prove yourself to be among the greats."

[Touko]
"I!! Don't!! Need!! It!!"

I whistled.

[Taichi]
"You're scaaaary."

[Touko]
"I don't talk like that!!"

[Taichi]
"You can turn the double exclamation point setting
off, you know."

[Touko]
"What did I do to deserve this?!"

[Taichi]
*burp burp-burp burp*

[Touko]
"Are you making fun of me?! You are, aren't you!
Then do your worst!!"

We had ignition.

[Touko]
"Isn't normal conversation a sign of friendship?
You just showed up to make fun of me!"
"Why is someone as stupid as you trying to make me
look stupid?! I can't believe it, don't want to
believe it, and won't let myself believe it!"

[Taichi]
"You're awfully fiery, aren't you."

She was amazing.

[Touko]
"~~II"

I listened with rapt attention.
Touko's right hand was a blur.
Huh?!
*POW*

[Taichi]
"Ugh."

I totally deserved that surprise punch.
It knocked me to the floor.
I rolled into an empty desk and chair. A truly
magnificent fall.

[Taichi]
"Owowowow..."
"That's the Harakiri Fist for you. There's no
stopping it."

[Touko]
"Idiots like you don't belong in the same world as
me! It's a mistake that I'm here and a mistake that
you're sitting next to me!"

[Taichi]
"Redundant, much?"

[Touko]
"Shuddup!"

[Taichi]
"This sexual hysteria is hard to stomach."

[Touko]
"Eww?!"

Her face froze.

[Touko]
"Uh, uh, uh... You... Did you really just say that?"

[Taichi]
"Was it in poor taste?"

I played dumb as I fiddled with my ear.

[Touko]
"It all was..."

She spoke in a muffled voice.

[Touko]
"Passing through distant dimensions..."

She slowly lifted her head.

[Touko]
"Get away from me!!"

I was deservedly punched again.
