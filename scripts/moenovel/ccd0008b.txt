I entered the first-year classroom.
Kiri and the others weren't there.
There was a cardboard box in the corner of the room.
A circular red stamp that said "Miki's House" marked
the box as if it made it look like a privately owned
box.

[Taichi]
"At least make it look more like a play-house..."

I guess it was Miki's personal property.
But I didn't know for sure.
I crawled inside the little cardboard house.
Why did I always cram myself into confined spaces?
Even still, it was a comfortable sort of confinement.
I waited.
No more than a few moments later, Kiri arrived.
She was alone.
She set her stuff down and went to the window.
After taking a quick scan of the area to make sure
no one was around, she reached under her skirt.
She fixed her wedgie.

[Taichi]
"..."

She fixed her wedgie.
She fixed her wedgie!
She fixed her wedgie!!
She fixed her marvelous wedgie!!
I became animalistic.
A camera.
My kingdom for a camera!
Why oh why hadn't I brought a camera with me?
I felt irritated. And angry.
The resentment I felt for myself at that moment
burned like a black flame, and I sullenly and
silently sulked.
Why?! Why now?! Why here?!
Why couldn't I have my camera?!
With as much will as I could muster, I paused my
inner monologue. Better to rest in the eye of the
self-reflective storm for now.
But Kiri's deviance didn't end there.
She took another quick glance about.
After double-checking her isolation, she unhooked
her skirt.

[Kiri]
"Ahh..."

Her skirt slid to the floor.

[Kiri]
"Phew, nothing's leaking."

Leaking? What? Could it be...?
Such casual, girlish silliness.
I couldn't take it. I couldn't!
As Kiri began to lean against the window...

[Taichi]
"Tadah!!"

[Kiri]
"Aaah?!"

I burst forth.

[Kiri]
"Ah, Taichi...?"

[Taichi]
"Tadahhh!!"

[Kiri]
"Wha-, whawhawhawha??"

Kiri went full panic.

[Taichi]
"I saw..."

[Kiri]
"Bwuh...?!"

[Taichi]
"You adjusting yourself, and then after that..."

[Kiri]
"Aaaaaaahhhhhhh..."

She was sort of speechless. I turned to
get ready to make my escape.

[Taichi]
"Everything..."

[Kiri]
"Ah, ugh..."

She had no more words.

[Taichi]
"That really made my morning. Thanks, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Th-that's... Uhh... Ughhh..."

[Taichi]
"Well, now that we're so open with one another...
How about getting lunch with me?"

[Kiri]
"Get out!!"

She booted me out of the room.
