[Taichi]
"Misato..."

[Misato]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Can you make miso soup for me from now on?"

It was an old-fashioned way of proposing, but I took
a stab in the dark.

[Misato]
"Uh."

She got flustered.
Her body stiffened, then her gaze drifted.
She placed her fist over her mouth and wrinkled her
forehead in deep thought.

[Misato]
"Pekke, I..."

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

[Misato]
"I can't make miso soup."

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

I yelled out.
As corny as it might have seemed, I thought it was
pretty decent way of playing it off as a joke.
