[Taichi]
"Well then, shall we retire?"

I stretched as I relaxed my tense shoulders.

[Touko]
"Woof."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm... For a rich girl, you're horrible at chess."

I stretched again.

[Touko]
"Woof..."

I got 10 wins, 0 losses.
Touko seemed faded away when we came
back from the beach, so I proposed a match
to distract her.

[Taichi]
"Do you need dinner?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

She shook her head no.

[Taichi]
"Okay, let's go to bed."
"Come on, over here."

I called to her gently and she blushed a little.

[Touko]
"Wooof."

She climbed into bed.
I held her close.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

I kissed her neck.

[Touko]
"Woof...ruff...woof."

[Taichi]
"By the way..."

[Touko]
"Woof?"

[Taichi]
"Why are you barking?"

[Touko]
"You made me speak like a dog as punishment
for losing at chess!"

[Taichi]
"Aaaah, that's right!"

I'd totally forgotten about it.

[Taichi]
"Okay then, speak doggy!"

[Touko]
"Uhm, can I just ask something first? How long
do I have to do this?"

[Taichi]
"Until you win at chess!"

[Touko]
"I'm going to die a dog!"

She covered her face.

[Taichi]
"Okay then, want to change the game?"

[Touko]
"To what?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

Accelerated calculation.
*ka-ching!*

[Taichi]
"To twister game."

...

[Voice]
"Right hand... Blue."

The battery-powered device called out the color.

[Taichi]
"Got it!"

[Touko]
"Gyaaah, don't stick your nose up there!"

[Taichi]
"It's not my fault!" *sniff sniff*

[Touko]
"Don't sniff me!"

[Voice]
"Left foot... Red."

[Touko]
"I-I can't...make it."

[Voice]
"Left hand... Green."

[Taichi]
"Pardon me, coming through your skirt..."

[Touko]
"Gaaagh!"
"What are you doing?!"

[Taichi]
"Playing twister!"

[Touko]
"I-It'll flip up!"

[Voice]
"Right foot... Red."

[Touko]
"Ohh... Owww! I won't make it!"

[Voice]
"Left foot... Yellow."

[Taichi]
"Reached it."

[Touko]
"Why are you so flexible?!"

[Taichi]
"I have a flexible mind."

[Touko]
"I don't understand at all."

[Voice]
"Left foot... Green."

[Touko]
"Unnn... I'm getting a cramp!"

[Voice]
"Right foot... Blue."

[Taichi]
"Excuse me!"

[Touko]
"Gah! That's my crotch!"

[Voice]
"Right hand... Green."

[Touko]
"I-I can't! I can't!"
"I hate Twister!"

...
10 wins, 0 losses.
I won.

[Taichi]
"Well then, shall we go to sleep?"

[Touko]
"Woof."

[Taichi]
"You tried so hard, I'll let the dog thing go."

[Touko]
*sigh*

She sighed heavily.

[Touko]
"I'm so tired..."

[Taichi]
"It is the middle of the night."

[Touko]
"Yeah, let's go to bed..."

[Taichi]
"Right."

...

[Taichi]
"Hey, in our house, guests sleep on the floor."

[Touko]
"The floor's too hard I won't be able to
sleep... You meanie!"

[Taichi]
"If a girl was sleeping next to me, I'd just be up
all night thinking lewd thoughts."

[Touko]
"But..."

[Taichi]
"If you can't sleep there, you're free to use any
bed in the house."

[Touko]
"Ugh..."

She was thinking it over.
Her eyes looked miserable.
My heart felt miserable too.

[Taichi]
"Is that a no?"

[Touko]
"Fine... I'll sleep here."

God, she was so cute.
She didn't want to sleep away from me.
But I couldn't be too kind.
Touko would get more and more spoiled.
She'd dissolve into nothing.
Just like a candy.
I'd have to slowly take my time licking her.
...so I wouldn't lose her.

[Touko]
"Taichi, you're kind of harsh."

Seriously...

[Taichi]
"Good night."

[Touko]
"So hard it hurts..." *sniff*

She lied down on a thin mattress spread on the
floor.
I lied down too.
Oppressive silence filled the room.
Outside the window, the starlight made patterns
like countless pillars of light.
It looked like a different world.

[Touko]
"Hey, Taichi..."

Her back spoke to me.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Touko]
"I wonder if we'll always be together."

[Taichi]
"You're stuck with me, even if you don't like it."

[Touko]
"Heheh, well then, I'm glad."

[Taichi]
"Why'd you ask all of a sudden?"

[Touko]
"Well, everyone disappeared, right?
Maybe someday, we..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"If we have to disappear,
I just hope we can go together."

Touko fell asleep.
Together, huh.
I hadn't really thought about it.
All that about people disappearing.
Why did it happen?
How did it happen?
There wasn't any way to explain it.
Youko wouldn't tell me anything. Clearly she didn't
know anything at all.
And even if she would tell me, it's not like we
could understand the reason.
I looked at the night sky through my window.
The eight of us just had to keep living.
We hurt and loved each other while we did it.
