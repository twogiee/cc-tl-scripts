What a beautiful world.
No matter how twisted things got, whenever I saw the
city, I was reminded that the world was beautiful.
Beauty was beauty, I couldn't deny it.
The air was alive with summer.
It was so exquisite that it was hard to describe it
in words.
That thought always struck me whenever I looked out
from these mountains.
In the distance, between the gently sighing trees,
I saw an isolated cluster of white buildings.
The city.
And I was standing in the tranquility of this brand
new, pristine city...
Okay... The tail end of it, anyway.
The city proper was on the other side,
tight against the towering mountains.
There were shopping malls, and if you went on there
was a train station at the far end, as well as
rental shops, arcades, bookstores, restaurants...
All signs that society had passed beyond mere
gluttony...
Some people jokingly called it "The City."
Well then, how about this side?
Lots and lots of houses.
Along with lots of hills, of course.
And there was a school. Just one.
Other than that, it was just nature, as far as the
eye can see.
It was the kind of town where everyday people would
come and go on their way to work. Coming and
going... (Insert adult joke #1)
A commuter town, in short.
Same city, two different places.
I bet we have some deep-seated political divisions
to thank for that.
If you looked at a map, these towering mountains
that divided the city, were simply called "hills."
Don't let the cute name fool you. They're anything
but.
If someone believed the name on the map, they might
drag wifey and little junior out for a hike or
something, and put the whole family in danger.
The only way to reach the city was by train or
unpaved mountain roads.
Actually, you technically could get to the city from
the roads branching off of the peaks on the other
side.
Well, so long as you didn't mind taking the scenic
route.
And so the city remained distant.
This really was the countryside.
Once, a boy in my class named Sakuraba had said:
"I'm taking this new bike through the pass. This is
something I have to do..."
And so, gritting his teeth, he had set out on his
journey.
And then...
Sakuraba hadn't come home for three days, and
eventually his parents had called the police.
Apparently, he had said he was taking his new
mountain bike for a little test ride.
But he had gotten carried away, and had ended up
having an accident about five kilometers out of
Aihara City, the next (and distant) town over.
In the end, they had caught him running at large, 
terrifying nobody in particular on a deserted
stretch of road.
Sakuraba's family was as wealthy as our classmate
Kirihara's, and his parents were quite
overprotective.
We called the two of them Sakuraba of the West and
Kirihara of the East.
The Kiriharas were an old samurai family, and their
daughter gave off an arrogant, aristocratic vibe.
The whole family walked around with sour faces,
and were harsh, unloving types.
Some people jokingly called them the "Harakiris."
The Sakurabas were the opposite. The closest they
came to martial valor was when the father almost
died from appendicitis because he didn't notice it.
It seemed his son had inherited his innate
clumsiness too.
It was hilarious catching glimpses of this idiocy,
like how they told the police he'd been kidnapped
when he didn't come home that night.
Sakuraba had been severely scolded by the police,
and his bike had been confiscated.
After that, he became the laughing stock of the
school.
For a good while, it was like he had a spot reserved
on the front page of the school newspaper.
His rambling interviews,
in particular, were a real riot.
"Breaking News: Mysterious Structure
Spotted in Hasegajo Back Woods!"
"Advanced Technology Hidden in the Wilds,
Accessible Only by 12 Hour Hike!"
"After an endless journey, I witnessed a scene
beyond my wildest imagination!"
Bullshit, all of it.
Basically, on his way home he had gotten lost in the
woods.
He had probably been looking for a shortcut.
And by sheer accident, he had stumbled on some kind
of facility.
Naturally, the interviews continued with incredible
revelations.
"...A secret base..."
"...Shocking..."
"...Heavily armed guards..."
"...Beyond the comprehension of mankind..."
Here are the top five keywords from the interviews:
Number 1: Mysterious (22 times)
Number 2: Shock (19 times)
Number 3: Discovery (17 times)
Number 4: Forbidden (6 times)
Number 5: Trembling (4 times)
The school newspaper stripped Sakuraba to the bone,
and sucked his marrow dry.
He learned how cruel journalism could be the hard
way.
Afterwards, he had diarrhea from the stress for a
week (there had been an article about it).
On the eighth day, he showed up at school like
nothing had happened (there had been photos).
The only difference was that he had dyed his hair
blond (there had been a special feature).
And from then on, he lived life as a blond.
Clearly, he was trying to overcome the stress by
creating the illusion of a "new self."
I guess this was the reason people had started to
call us "Gold" and "Silver."
Anyway, back on track.
What Sakuraba had mistaken for an advanced
extraterrestrial outpost was the nuclear power plant
that had brought prosperity to the city.
It was an example of dirt cheap land transformed
into solid gold, right before your eyes.
I guess it was a sign of the times.
People got rich, buildings were built, and the city
as we know it came to be.
The land was cheap, and the taxes low.
And the electricity was free.
That's why the city had so many lights everywhere.
And yet, none of them seemed to be anywhere useful.
The city decided its theme should be "Healing."
Which was a peculiar theme for a rural community so
deeply tied to a nuclear power plant.
Yet the city hall, with its rococo aesthetic,
overflowed inside and out with an aura that screamed
"Be thou healed!"
It was an odd place, to be sure.
And yet...perhaps that's what made it so
comfortable.
It retained a strange, intimate sense of a world
that had been broken.

[Taichi]
"..."
"Ouch."

I made out a hushed sound.
My head was suddenly pushed forward.
I could feel the tendons in the back of my head
stretch, and it hurt like hell.

[Taichi]
"What the hell?!"

I turned around, and saw a young girl.

[Taichi]
"Oh, it's the Empress."

[Girl]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Methinks Her Majesty is in high spirits this morn."

I raised my hand in greeting.

[Girl]
"..."

I expected her to respond with one of her typical
witty retorts.
"Oh, you! Who you callin' Empress, anyway!
Why I oughta!!"
Or something like that.
But alas, my hopes were dashed.
I was met instead with cold anger.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong, Kirihara? I expected a bit more
oomph."
"Oh... Could it be? That time of the month?"

[Girl]
"..."

The air chilled several degrees.
But I didn't stop.

[Taichi]
"A visit from Aunt Flo?"

[Girl]
"Taichi Kurosu..."

It was like I could see the anger flowing out of
her.

[Taichi]
"Chocolate and ice cream time?"

Touko... Kirihara was her family name, but she would
always be Touko in my heart... Anyway, right now her
head was twitching slightly...

[Girl]
"Naaaah!"

I'm sure she was really saying "You bastard!"
She didn't always say what she meant.
I guess I just had a way of understanding.
It was genuinely amusing how haughty Touko could be,
yet she still sounded like a kid when she talked.
All of a sudden-
WHACK!

[Taichi]
"Ooof!"

Right on the chin.
It was a clean hit.
I had no chance to dodge.
She had delivered an uppercut, her fist thrusting my
chin into the air and knocking my head back.
She hit me so hard, I actually saw lights, like
effects from a video game.

[Touko]
"Help us clean up the camp."

Her voice was low.
If I kept poking at her, I wouldn't be kissing the
sky next time, I'd be eating dirt.
That was the impression I got, anyway.

[Taichi]
"Yes, I'll help- OWW!"

Without a word, she grabbed me by the ear and
dragged me back to camp.

[Taichi]
"Ow ow ow! You're hurting me!"

[Touko]
"Well, you hurt my hand with your head."

[Taichi]
"Hey! What's with the evil-stepmother-punishing-
a-hated-child line!"

[Touko]
"There aren't many guys to help, so get to work."

[Taichi]
"I already have! I did my share during this trip..."

[Touko]
"We can't relax until it's all done."

[Taichi]
"Can't I take a little break?"

Was I her soldier or something?

[Taichi]
"Kirihara..."

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"It was fun, yeah? The camping, I mean."

[Touko]
"..."
"Hmph."

She ignored me.
She was clearly not in a talkative mood.
Still, for her this was a lot of chatter.
It was weird for her to actually engage in
conversation like this.

[Touko]
"Your head is empty."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Touko]
"When I hit you, it made a hollow sound."
"If you don't get those brain cells multiplying,
you'll regret it when you're all grown up."

[Taichi]
"Oh, how rude! Hope you have a lawyer ready!"

[Touko]
"You...are so...exhausting..."

She sighed heavily, and I decided to stop there.
I went along silently behind her.
My eyes unconsciously fell to her butt, wrapped
gently in an expensive-looking dress.

[Taichi]
"Like a lovely little peach..."

I whispered, so she wouldn't hear.

[Touko]
"If you touch it you are going down."

[Taichi]
"..."

Down...where? (Hoo boy...)

[Touko]
"I feel like I wasted a whole week of summer break."

[Taichi]
"You mean, 'Oh, I'm so sad this lovely camping trip
is over!' right?"

[Touko]
"Is your brain broken?"

It was.

[Taichi]
"I just had a good time, that's all."

[Touko]
"Hmph!"

[Taichi]
"Sure looked like you enjoyed yourself..."
*mumble mumble*

[Touko]
"Did. You. Say. Something?"

[Taichi]
"No ma'am! Not a word!"

We had been camping for a whole week.
It might have only been a couple of times, but I had
seen her smile.
Her expression was always so serious normally.
No mistake, she must have had fun.
What with the tents, and all the equipment...
The whole thing felt like it had happened in another
world.

[Taichi]
"Owowowowowow!"

She pulled harder at my ear.
We came out of the woods, and into the open.
Light was raining down.
The sunlight was brilliant.

[Touko]
"Everything's mostly done."

[Girl]
"Come on you two, quit playing hooky!"

A gentle voice floated over.
A distinct voice.
Our club president.

[Touko]
"No, wait, it wasn't me!"

[Taichi]
"Owowow, Don't run! Hey! My ear!"
"Ow! Don't pull so hard, my ear's gonna rip! It'll
rip! It's very important to me, don't rip it!"

[Club President]
"Please knock off the kinky stuff!"
"You don't want to get suspended, do you?"

The club president's voice was trembling in dismay.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Touko]
"Oh, you perv..."

[Taichi]
"Ouch."

I stroked my beloved ear, released at long last,
along with my poor beaten head.
I grinned.

[Taichi]
"Teehee, ouch."
"Okay, it's off to work I go!"

[Touko]
"That boy..."

I skipped away.

[Touko]
"Ugh, seriously..."

Touko's sigh followed after me.
I could see the others behind the club president.
We went over to them together.

[Taichi]
"Heeey!"

I called out, for no reason in particular.
Five heads, all busy gathering up equipment, turned
to me at the same time.
The attention made me want to act the fool.
I took off my shirt.

[Touko]
"Gross?!"

Behind me, the Empress shrieked in disgust.
I ran around barechested.
My nipples frolicked in the wind.
I felt the five pairs of eyes on me.
I felt lifted up.

[Taichi]
"Look at Meee!!!"

The five heads turned back to their work, as if
nothing had even happened.
An excellent demonstration of synchronized ignoring.

[Taichi]
"Aha!"

I was a happy idiot.
For the moment, at least.
The trip would end.
And the new school year would start
Our old lives would resume.
And the same old tomorrow would play out again...
