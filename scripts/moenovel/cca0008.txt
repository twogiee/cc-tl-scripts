I was in the middle of returning to class after
killing some time in the clubroom.
I noticed a girl crouched in the empty hallway.
Love-making lvl. 0.

[Taichi]
"Are you okay, young lady?"

I tried reaching for her butt.

[Girl]
"Whoa!"

The girl leapt to her feet instantly.
She shuffled to keep her distance.
She was quick to prepare for battle.
She even attempted to get a hit on me as she sprung
back up.

[Taichi]
"Not bad."

[Girl]
"You too."

I caught the dust cloth that was aimed for my face
and tossed it onto the floor.

[Taichi]
"Long time no see. Nine, no, ten hours ago?"

[Girl]
"Maybe."

Her looks definitely did not infringe on any
copyright claims or constitute plagiarism in any
way, shape, or form. Just throwing that out there.
It made me feel safe knowing that.
Safety first.

[Taichi]
"Don't think I forgot your name just because we
haven't met in a while."

[Girl]
"Yeah?"

[Taichi]
"So don't worry..."

[Both]
Taichi: "Xavier."
Girl: "Couldn't you at least try with a girl's name?"

I could tell by her face that she'd already forgiven
me since it was a cool name.

[Taichi]
"You've improved, Miki."

[Miki]
"Of course!"

Miki Yamanobe stood proudly, presenting her sad
little chest.

[Miki]
"You won't get my butt that easily."

[Taichi]
"I had it on the tips of my fingers."

[Miki]
"Only because I let you."

She doesn't miss a beat.

[Taichi]
"But you didn't seem to notice your skirt flapped-"

[Miki]
"It didn't."

She's good.
She didn't fall for bluffs anymore.

[Taichi]
"All right, you win this time."

[Miki]
"Heheh."

She gave a big smile.
Wow, I want to hug her.

[Taichi]
"What were you doing anyway? Playing cleaning lady
or something?"

[Miki]
"Ah, yes. The school's been getting a bit dirty
lately."
"I like cleanliness."

She flexed. Not that she had any muscle to do it
with.

[Taichi]
"Voluntary, eh? That's so cool!"
"Ahh. I got it, I got it. You don't have to say
anything, my sweet. You want my autograph, right?
I, Taichi Ijuin's, signature?"
"You didn't have to demand it in such a roundabout
way."

[Miki]
"Oh, oh... You're doing that thing."
"It's been a while."

Her expression turned to one of slight
disappointment.
Like she was gonna cry.
Like she was gonna cry.
Made me think the same thing twice.
Gah, I need to figure out how to play this cool.
We were two elite young adult cadets who shared
bittersweet feelings!

[Taichi]
"Wh-what's wrong, Yamanobe?! I w-won't enforce it
upon you if you aren't up to it! Report to me
honestly!"

Jeez, my voice sounded so shaky.

[Taichi]
"Oh god, you're crying..."

She wiped the corner of her eye.
It made me want to cry too.

[Miki]
"Ah, no. It's nothing, sir."
"Just some youth juice coming out of my tear
hole..."

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

Youth juice.

[Taichi]
"Don't scare me like that."

I wiped off the cold sweat from my brow.

[Taichi]
"So I guess the Prince's (my) autograph will be put
on hold."

[Miki]
"No!"

She shrieked out.

[Miki]
"I do want it. Give it to me!"

[Taichi]
"Y-you want me give it to you that badly?"

That made me wince.

[Miki]
"Do it, please give it to me."

She really just asked for me to "give it to her" in
that high-pitched voice?
My lower body was getting hot.
But then it calmed down.
What a benign human being I am.

[Taichi]
"O-okay. Give me that thing."

[Miki]
"Yes."

Miki pulled out a student handbook from her
flatboard chest.

[Taichi]
"Student handbook."

I said out loud, meaninglessly.

[Miki]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Well, just like various countries have various laws
and things they can and can't do because of ratings,
there are also words you can and can't say."

[Miki]
"You don't think everyone has to understand the
words you are saying, do you?"

[Taichi]
"And yet, I've just lost my sexual desire."

[Miki]
"Wh-what is this old man saying?!"

[Taichi]
"I'm out of good comebacks..."

[Miki]
"You got old."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

[Miki]
"Be careful not to infringe on specific trademarks
and/or rights of corporations covered by ethical
regulations."

[Taichi]
"That's beyond my control..."

I couldn't have everything. I felt so helpless.

[Miki]
"Holy hell, my head..."

Miki scratched her head.
She blushed a little, no doubt because of our
lustful conversation.
No words were spoken.
She looked out the window and just stood there
awkwardly.
Wow, this made it more embarrassing. Say something.
Use your words to make fun of me, please.
Miki had become more knowledgeable about sex and
stuff thanks to me, but didn't have the experience
to talk about it directly.
A pure girl who forbade direct harassment.
Taichi Keyword:
"Direct harrassment"
Teasing or childish crude acts that could be seen as
sexual harrassment... Basically sexual harrassment.

[Taichi]
"You sure do use your handbook a lot, Miki.
It's worn-out."

[Miki]
"Worn-out."

Repeated Miki, unnecessarily.
The handbook was filled with autographs that I'd
signed.
Page after page.
She was really into collecting my autographs.
Actually, I might be making her collect them...
I found an empty page and filled in my autograph.

[Taichi]
"..."
"Um, I'm using your chest so that I can sign my
autograph, okay? It's not to tease you or be mean to
you or anything..."

[Miki]
"I'm not opposed to it."

[Taichi]
"Y-yeah?"

I finished my autograph.
Miki looked happy.
She really didn't seem opposed to it.
I checked the other pages.

[Miki]
"Ah, I don't write my dates on there or anything."

[Taichi]
"Is that so."

I handed the notebook back to her.
She hugged it to her slipper-sole chest.

[Miki]
"Nothing to worry about, I'm a pure young lady."

[Taichi]
"I-I'm going to need to see some proof."

I was childish when flustered.

[Miki]
"Why yes. Of course you do."
