[Kiri]
"What?!"

Kiri shuddered at the sight.

[Kiri]
"That underwear..."

I was still in the elephant pants that Miki had
slipped me into (and it was certainly more slipping
than dressing) the day before.

[Miki]
"Huh? You didn't take a bath, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Miki]
"Nasty!"

[Kiri]
"So filthy......"

Agh, the girls were such a clean freak.
I was trapped in their admonishments.

[Miki]
"And it's summertime, you know?"

[Kiri]
"His personality must match his appearance."

[Taichi]
"So what, being dirty is a crime now?"

[Kiri]
"It's best to deal with him, right now."

[Taichi]
"Wait a sec!"

[Miki]
"Mmm... My image of you has fallen dramatically."

[Taichi]
"But it's just one day! I take a bath tomorrow and
I'm good as new, right?"

[Kiri]
"He doesn't even get it..."

[Miki]
"You need to take a bath every day, you know..."

[Taichi]
"Eh, really? Youko never told me that...
I had no idea..."

These kinds of things happen all the time. We live
in an age individualism! People keep to themselves
and value their privacy!
Being a 'regular' person wasn't so easy!

[Miki]
"What should we do, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"It's pretty bad, Miki."

[Miki]
"Yep, pretty bad."

They banded together to discipline me.

[Kiri]
"I thought he was pretty strange at first,
but for him to be this out there..."

[Miki]
"I guess we gotta do it, huh?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah, it can't be helped."

[Miki]
"I mean, we can't go to club with him like this."

[Kiri]
"Nope. Where should we do it?"

[Taichi]
"What do you two mean by 'it?'"

Kiri and Miki ignored me, and continued talking to
one another.
Their voices were hushed. I could only hear bits and
pieces of their conversation.

[Miki]
"Somewhere no one can see."

[Kiri]
"We'll have to keep quiet."

[Miki]
"With strong medicine..."

[Kiri]
"Do it thoroughly..."

What were those two plotting?

[Taichi]
"I've got a bad feeling about this..."

I wondered if I should run away.

[Kiri]
"Don't move!"

[Taichi]
"Hng?!"

No good. I couldn't escape now.
If I tried anything, Kiri might shoot me.

[Miki]
"Taichi, we've decided how to deal with you."

[Taichi]
"Should I put my pants on?"

[Miki]
"Nope."

[Taichi]
"You monster."

[Miki]
"Leave it to the professionals."

So Miki was a professional now, huh?

[Taichi]
"Okay, okay... But this is some pretty severe
treatment for just one day without a bath..."

[Miki]
"I can't believe it. You only have to take care of
your hygiene since you don't even have a single
responsibility."
"But you've been neglecting that duty, Taichi."

[Kiri]
"You're not normal...in a number of ways."

Now they were treating me like a freak.

[Miki]
"Let's go."

They dragged me along with them.
And then...

[Taichi]
"Uh, what are you gonna do to me?"

I was extremely unnerved.
Misato hadn't come yet.
In other words, there was no one around to save me.
Miki appeared with a hose.
Kiri was standing to watch over me with her crossbow
in hand.

[Miki]
"Take off your clothes, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Aren't I naked enough?"

[Kiri]
"..."

*click* Kiri pointed the loaded crossbow at me.

[Taichi]
"All right."

I stripped for them.
I removed my shirt.
My stripping continued for what felt like eternity,
until I was left in only the elephant panties.

[Taichi]
"These too, huh?"

[Miki]
"Hmmm, maybe we'll leave those be."

And with that, Miki released the valve on the grip
of the hose.

[Miki]
"Here we go!"

Water burst from the hose and struck me full on.

[Taichi]
"Gpft!"

[Miki]
"Take it!"

So this was what they were whispering about.
A compulsory cleaning.
Ahh, if only this cleaning came with a sensual
massage...

[Miki]
"Kiri, the medicine!"

[Kiri]
"Okay!"

Kiri fired something my way.

[Taichi]
"Oof, wh-what's this?"

There was a sickly smell of citrus mint.
Body soap?
Kiri gave the bottle in her hand a squeeze,
and I was quickly doused in their liquid abuse.

[Miki]
"You ready for this?"

Kiri and Miki had deck brushes in hand...
Deck brushes!

[Miki]
"Get him!"

[Kiri]
"Yep yep!"

I was scrubbed raw like a hardwood floor.

[Taichi]
"Owowowowowowowowowow!!"

It stung so much!

[Taichi]
"Do I look like a deck floor to you?!"

Crap, I realized that I hadn't eaten lunch yet.
I wondered when this will end...

[Miki]
"Soap, more soap!"

[Kiri]
"Soap, on it!"

Their calls for soap continued.
My heart began to pound.
And then, the deck brushes again.
Once I got used to the agony, it almost started to
feel all right.
The stinging even became a refreshing sensation.

[Kiri]
"M-Miki! Th-the elephant?!"

[Miki]
"Whah?! It's reaching for a drink!"

Kiri dowsed the poor elephant.

[Kiri]
"Pervert! Pervert!!"

[Taichi]
"Th-this is what happens when I get stimulated...
I can't hel-"

[Miki]
"Scrub-a-lub-dub-dub!"

Their exfoliating became much more vigorous.

[Kiri]
"Eek, the elephant's gone!"

Kiri's torrent completely removed them.

[Miki]
"You mean my precious elephant cover that I bought
from Atomic Shop?!"

Of course it had been from Atomic Shop...
That shopkeeper (female, beautiful, 25 years old)
had a perverted streak too. She had sold all kinds
of stuff.

[Miki]
"Look Kiri, it's like a different species!"

[Kiri]
"I can't look! It'll rot my eyes!"

They were acting like elementary school kids.

[Miki]
"Hey, did it move just now?!"

[Kiri]
"Aiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeee!!"

They ran away as fast as they could.
I was left standing alone in my nakedness.

[Taichi]
"Heh..."

A single tear escaped the corner of my eye.

[Misato]
*yawn* "Well then, let's get a lot done today...?"
"Aaaaaaaagggggghhhhhhh?!"

Only a truly innocent maiden could have had that
kind of response.

[Taichi]
"Heh."

It was a bittersweet moment...

[Taichi]
*sob sob sob*

I began to cry.
*fwump*
I suddenly felt a towel wrap around me.

[Miki]
"Ah, sorry we ran away!"
"We got a bit too worked up, we've never seen that
kind of thing before... Here you go."

She handed me clean underwear and a uniform.

[Taichi]
*sob* "Miki...you're the best."

I put on the clothing.

[Miki]
"You're spotless now, all better!"

[Taichi]
"It still stings all over."

[Miki]
"Kiri, Misato, it's safe now!"

[Kiri]
"Really?"

Kiri and Misato made their way over in trepidation.

[Miki]
"Now that that's finished, let's do club activities!"

She put on a bright smile.
And so we went about club activities with zeal.
Ahhh, things felt so much simpler.
Was this what unity was supposed to feel like?
I had put so much effort in planning the camp, was
there really any meaning to it?
Were my methods poor? Was I being too forceful?
How should one connect with others?
There we so many things I still didn't understand.
