Touko was in the classroom.
She was asleep on the desk.
She must have been sitting here all this time.
Didn't escape to the club like Mimi and Tomoki...
Didn't take it easy like me...
And didn't have a strong ego like Youko.
Touko may not have a place to escape to.
That was...the same as before.
Before mankind vanished.
Touko was alone.
She had been living a lie her whole life.
It was like she was on thin ice, and it was only
getting thinner.
I got closer and called her.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"...Hmm."

She moved.
But didn't wake up.

[Taichi]
"Do you want a sandwich?"

[Touko]
"Don't have the appetite."

Her breathing sounded like she went back to sleep.

[Taichi]
"I see."

She seemed to be worn out.
Has she been eating properly?
I took out a candy from my pocket and left it on her
desk.
