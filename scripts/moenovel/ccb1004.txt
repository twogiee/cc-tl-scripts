On the roof, I could see that the assembly of the
antenna was not progressing well.

[Taichi]
"Misato?"

[Misato]
"Hm? Yes?"

[Taichi]
"What are you doing asleep this time of day?"

[Misato]
"What? I wasn't sleeping."

She squirmed around, still looking half asleep.

[Misato]
"Anyway, good morning."

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Misato."
"Won't you get sick from sun exposure, sleeping
here?"

[Misato]
"Oh, yeah, but I'm being careful."

She lifted the edge of her skirt to wipe her
glasses.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

It didn't feel right to look at her like this. I
turned around.
Amazing. I was such a gentleman.
Sometimes, I amaze myself.

[Misato]
"Better clean these glasses."

Misato was still half asleep behind me.
Maybe she had been up all night again?
I wasn't brave enough to ask her.
I looked back and she peered at me.
I could see those ample thighs of hers.
But, they didn't turn me on.
I was back to my normal self.
Well, was this even normal for me?
Whatever.

[Taichi]
"Hm!"

I suddenly had a strange thought.
About this girl, Misato.
Misato wore glasses.
Her glasses were one of her defining features as a
character. They added charm and made her stand out.
But often these glasses type characters were not so
popular. So absurd!
I, Taichi Kurosu, question the world!
Don't mess with girls with glasses!
Ahh... I felt better.
Then, Misato spoke.

[Misato]
"Sweepy..."

She tried to stop a yawn as she wiped her glasses.
She was so pure.
My pure Misato.
I turned around to face her direction again.
She put her glasses back on.

[Misato]
"I'm so sleepy."

[Taichi]
"Sure looks like it."

[Misato]
"So, umm... What were we talking about?"

[Taichi]
"I want to help out."
"I'm part of the club, so let me help with the
work."

[Misato]
"Ahh..."

She started mumbling to herself.
I tried to listen to what she was saying, but I
couldn't quite make it out.
I could just hear bits and pieces of her mumbling.

[Misato]
"I was stupid to worry."
"I wasn't trying to run."
"...Like a dog..."
"I'm used to it."
"It's not a bother..."
"...Need to be taught."
"I'm older, after all."
*hiccup*

She finished with a hiccup.
She was normally a fine, clear headed kind of girl.
Something was up.

[Taichi]
"M-Misato?"

[Misato]
"Composition..."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"You've got to do the composition."

Her eyes seemed to sink as she spoke.

[Taichi]
"Composition? What are you talking about?"

[Misato]
"The composition for the first transmission of the
Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club."

[Taichi]
"Oh, the planned transmission to be sent through
that antenna on its first broadcast?"

[Misato]
"Yes, something with knowledge, emotion,
tears, and truth."
"Something that will allow our broadcasting club to
revitalize that old fashioned youth culture through
the ears of those that hear us!"

A bunch of liquor bottles rolled around her feet.

[Taichi]
"Uhh...?"

[Misato]
"Lack of morals, too much individualism, violations
of human rights, all the things that are a hazard to
a kid in this day and age!"
"Can we youth help each other and build ourselves up
together? I think that the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting
Club can be the answer that we seek!"

[Taichi]
"Well said!"

[Misato]
"Heh heh heh."

She laughed.
She relaxed a little and put her hands into her 
pockets.
Then she pulled something out.
It was a small bottle of sake.

[Taichi]
"Hey... Wait!"

Too late!
She chugged it down, with the practiced form of
a heavy drinker.
It was like watching some old guy at a bar.

[Misato]
"We need that composition..."

She said, her eyes looking droopy.

[Taichi]
"S-sure..."

[Misato]
"The deadline is on Sunday."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Misato]
"Great!"
"Well, then...I'm gonna expect the best from you...
And...maybe, I think, I'll take a nap over here..."

[Taichi]
She sounded positively drunk.

[Misato]
"Ugh..."

She lay down on the ground.

[Taichi]
"You can't do that!"

[Misato]
"Heh heh heh heh..."

[Taichi]
"Misato! Misato!"

[Misato]
"Night..."

And she was asleep.
She's normally so serious. It must be the liquor...
I couldn't believe it.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I checked the liquor that she drank.
It was non-alcoholic.
Alcohol: 0

[Taichi]
"She got drunk on this?"

That obviously shouldn't have had any effect...
Odd.

[Taichi]
"Anyway... Let's get you to the nurse's office
to sleep."

[Misato]
"Pekke...good..."

It sounded like she was trying to say thanks,
but didn't quite get the words out.

[Taichi]
"I'm going to pick you up and carry you, okay?"

[Misato]
*zzz*

[Taichi]
"I might touch your boobs or butt, okay?"
"You might not have panties on when you wake,
okay?"
"When you wake up, you might feel a breeze down 
there and say, 'Where are my panties? What
happened?'"
"Did I do something shameful? No... I couldn't
have... Something happened to me."
"I'm what happened to you!"

I slapped myself on the head.

[Taichi]
"Ugh, seriously..."

She was totally useless.
Anyway, I got her sitting up.
She slumped.
Her neck rolled.
She was dead asleep.

[Taichi]
"She must have been really tired."

I needed to get her up to take her to the nurse's
office.
I threw her over my back and tried to move her.
But with her asleep, it was difficult to maneuver.

[Taichi]
"Hm? Huh?"

I finally got her up into a piggyback position.
In order to stabilize her, I reached my arms around
to hold her.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

My fingers poked something that I didn't expect.
*poke*
My fingers got caught in her clothes.
She was starting to slip.
I tried to keep her on my back, but she was falling.
My hands slipped, and her blouse started
to pull out of her skirt.

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

This wasn't good! Her clothes might rip.
I let her down.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

Okay.
*flop*
Something had fallen on the floor.

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

Her bra!
Why?
When I touched her, I must have...

[Taichi]
"Damn, this won't be good if someone finds out."

Even though I kind of liked it.
I picked up her bra.
And pushed her blouse back into her skirt.

[Taichi]
"..."

I had to do something with her bra...
Today, she hadn't worn a bra. She forgot.

[Taichi]
"Let's go with that."

I put her bra in my pocket, and picked her up again.
She was quite heavy.
I managed to get her onto my back once again.
Her boobs...
With only a shirt to cover them.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh..."

I could feel them against me.

[Taichi]
"Hurry...to the nurse's room."

I felt pretty embarrassed.
My face was hot.
I wasn't myself.
I got there, finally.
There was no one around.
I laid her down on the bed.

[Taichi]
"Good night, Misato. Sweet dreams."
"..."

As I watched her sleep, my heart began to well up.

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

I put my face close to hers.
*smooch*

[Taichi]
"Okay then."

The day had just begun.
...With a kiss.
