[Taichi]
"Here."

I gave her the paper bag.
She should have no problem obtaining food supply
herself...

[Youko]
"Thanks..."

She started eating.

[Taichi]
"Okay, later."

I started walking.

[Youko]
"..."

*nibble nibble nibble*
She followed me as she ate...
So, I decided to tease her.

[Taichi]
"Oh, hey Youko, come here for a bit."

I called her over.
I held her head and pressed down on the
pressure point.

[Youko]
"Uh, uhh, no... Not there... It makes my stomach
feel weird."

[Taichi]
"You are the definition of healthy, aren't you?"

I kept pushing.

[Youko]
"Uhh, my head... Don't push it... It feels strange
up there..."

She twisted and twirled her body.
I didn't let her escape.

[Taichi]
"How about that?"

[Youko]
"I give, I give."

Early afternoon, I continued to bully her.
