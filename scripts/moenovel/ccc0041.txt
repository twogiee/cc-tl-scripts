The nurse's office.
The place felt empty without a nurse (often having a
strong tone) with enormous fun bags and glasses.
A nurse's office without a nurse with enormous fun
bags and glasses was like an expensive piece of
sushi with no fish.
As of right now, the likelihood of seeing the nurse
with enormous fun bags and glasses was zero.
Youko was there in her place.

[Taichi]
"Put on some glasses and a white coat."

[Youko]
"Yeah..."

She disappeared near the bed.
And returned with glasses on.
That was too quick.
Why the bed?
And then, from the school nurse's locker...
There was a white coat inside.
She came back.
She delivered exactly what I asked for.
And she did it in under ten seconds.

[Youko]
"Better...?"

[Taichi]
"A-Okay!"

[Youko]
"Okay."

There was no way I could ever disapprove of this.
And it wasn't like her fun bags were "fun size"
either.
Youko as a school nurse in a white coat.
"Take your clothes off. I can't examine you if
you don't."
"Down there, too."
"No... You'll pay dearly if you try to touch me."
"Yes... Hold still... Good boy..."

[Taichi]
"Oooh..."

This wasn't so bad!

[Youko]
"Just now, I could tell you were having a bawdy
fantasy about me."

[Taichi]
"..."

I've been conquered.
Because of our long relationship...

[Taichi]
"Enough with the cosplay."

[Youko]
"You made me do it."

She muttered.
She returned to her usual self.
And went back to the bed to return the glasses.

[Taichi]
"Why are you here?"

[Youko]
"Miyasumi was hurt..."

I took a peek at the bed.

[Taichi]
"Mimi?"

[Youko]
"She's asleep already."

[Taichi]
"You treated her?"

[Youko]
"I did."

I fixed my gaze on her.

[Taichi]
"Rare for you to voluntarily help someone else like
that."

[Youko]
"If I didn't...I thought you'd tease me."

[Taichi]
"I see."

She was right about that.
I pinched both of her cheeks.

[Taichi]
"But I'll tease you either way."

[Youko]
"Yeah..."

I kneaded her pretty face like clay.

[Youko]
"Stop it..."

But she didn't really resist.
She didn't know how.
Normally, she just rejected or ignored.

[Taichi]
"Take that, and that."

[Youko]
"Oooh... Oooh..."

[Taichi]
"Your cheeks sure are soft."

[Youko]
"It hurts... It really hurts..."

[Taichi]
"It's your fault for having cheeks."

[Youko]
"You and your nonsense."

Enough playing around.

[Taichi]
"So will our injured patient pull through?"

[Youko]
"Nothing life-threatening. Just light scrapes and
bumps."

She said with her slightly red cheeks.

[Taichi]
"Good to hear."

Looked like she was breathing normally.
She didn't seem to be in pain.

[Taichi]
"She's sleeping well."

I pushed the hair from her face.

[Misato]
"Mmm."

She purred like a cat.
Adorable.
Moved my hand to another place.
*grab*

[Taichi]
"Grrr!"

Youko grabbed me by the wrist.
She had the grip of a grown man!

[Taichi]
"What are you doing...?"

[Youko]
"You were trying to harvest some melons."

[Taichi]
"N-no."

[Youko]
"Stuttering isn't going to help you out."
"Especially, with the way you act to girls..."

[Taichi]
"Ugh. You know me that well, huh..."

As I thought, the whole world was a metagame.

[Youko]
"For as long as I'm here, there will be no
harvesting of melons."

[Taichi]
"Damn you!"

Though, I am no match to her in close combat.

[Taichi]
"How about this?!"

I made the mistake of thrusting my free hand
toward Youko's chest.

[Youko]
"I knew that was coming..."

Youko's eyes were brimming with confidence.
Who cares!
Even if it was a trap!

[Taichi]
"Nothing will stop me!"

My left hand grabbed her breasts.
She showed no indication of dodging or blocking.

[Youko]
"Just as planned..."

[Taichi]
"What?!"

[Youko]
"Your attacking out of confusion and targeting me...
I saw it coming."

[Taichi]
"This feel... Could it be?!"

[Youko]
"Yep... No bra."

[Taichi]
"Uhh... Uhhhhh... Say what?!"

So soft.
Through her clothes they felt unbelievably soft!

[Taichi]
"Ahhhh!"

My wisdom faded away...

[Taichi]
"Oh, my Sophia (wisdom)..."

Touching something so soft yet firm, was degrading
my wisdom!
The meatier the body the faster the degradation.

[Taichi]
"...Such a sophisticated object... My mind is falling
apart."

Next thing I knew, both of my hands were on her
breasts.
Ahhhhh.
I've been seduced.
Totally seduced.

[Misato]
*yawn*

Misato woke up.

[Misato]
"Ah... I slept with my glasses...on..."

She noticed our strange situation.

[Misato]
"Hiyah!"

She struck a karate chop.
And separated the object and my hand.

[Misato]
"Pekke!"

[Taichi]
"Y-yes!"

[Misato]
"That's a yellow suspension!"

She thrust her finger at me.
Wondered if there was a red suspension...

[Taichi]
"B-but she's got such sophisticated assets!"

[Misato]
"I don't care what she has, that's no excuse!"

She scythed her arm with a strong gesture that could
have taken my head off.

[Misato]
"Long time, no see, Hasekura."

[Youko]
"Mm-hm."

[Misato]
"It really has been... O-ouch..."

[Taichi]
"Are you okay?"

[Misato]
"Yeah, some materials collapsed on me and..."

[Taichi]
"Youko saved you."

[Misato]
"Oh... She did?"

[Youko]
"I'm not the one who saved you."

[Taichi]
"Then who?"

[Youko]
"It was Tomoki Shima."

[Taichi]
"Tomoki?"

Ah-hah. That's why he was there...

[Taichi]
"He is super shy you know..."

Mimi looked dumbfounded.

[Taichi]
"...Hello?"

[Misato]
"Tomoki helped...me...?"

She looked panicked as well.
Since when was it now...?
Both of them stopped talking to each other.
Tomoki was in the club room.
Mimi was in the broadcast room.
It was rare for them to be in the same room.
Anyone would perceive it instantly.
The reason though, that remained unclear.
The weird vibes amongst us all...
The next thing I knew, Youko had disappeared.
