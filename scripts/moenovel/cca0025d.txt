Come on, I've got this!

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

[Misato]
"Yeah?"

[Taichi]
"Will you marry me?"

I proposed with my thumbs up.

[Misato]
"Heheh."

She gently smiled back like an angel.
*Angel's Call*

[Misato]
"No way!"

[Taichi]
"Hello Tomoki? It's Kurosu. Yeah, I just proposed
to your sister but got rejected. For real, just now.
She's right next to me. Hahaha!"
"Anyway, I'm so over the moon and extremely bitter
at the same time! Thanks for encouraging me to
express my feelings. Go rot in hell!!"

[Misato]
"Isn't your phone out of battery...?"

[Taichi]
"You don't need to state the obvious!"

I broke down into tears.

[Taichi]
"Waah!"

[Misato]
"You don't need to take it out on him..."

[Taichi]
"I meant it as a joke..."
"But I thought the timing was good, and that things
would work out. My heart aches to have been turned
down so easily!"

[Misato]
"It's your fault for blurting out a proposal out of
nowhere."

[Taichi]
"But, you never know what life is going to throw at
you! You've just gotta believe in the moment."

[Misato]
"Here, I'll give you a pickled cucumber to make you
feel better. And drop that tone now too, okay?"

[Taichi]
"Hey don't try pawning my feelings off with a lousy
cucumber..."

[Misato]
"I'm sure you'll meet a better person, Pekke."

[Taichi]
"I'm going to cry."

The cucumber tasted like a broken heart with a side
of crushed dreams.
