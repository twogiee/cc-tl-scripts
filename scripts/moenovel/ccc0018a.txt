"Well then, let me give you this."

I took out a wrapped sandwich from my bag.

[Miki]
"What's this?"

[Taichi]
"There's a fairytale about eating some sand
and a witch in between..."

[Miki]
"Ah, a sandwich."

She beat me to it.

[Taichi]
"Ughh, that's right!"

[Miki]
"I'm being scolded..."

[Taichi]
"Take it!"

[Miki]
"What, are you sure? Isn't it your food?"

[Taichi]
"I can get them anytime."
"There's enough for two, eat it with Kiri."

[Miki]
"That's thoughtful of you...but."

[Taichi]
"I invited Kiri to lunch but I couldn't get any
response from her."

[Miki]
"Wooow, it's the apocalypse and this guy still
teases Kiri..."

Miki trembled uncontrollably.

[Taichi]
"I'm not due to change just because the world is
ending."

I said in a monologue tone.

[Miki]
"As expected of this young man..."

[Taichi]
"Don't get it wrong. I'm Young Adult Cadet to you."

[Miki]
"I can't tell the difference."

[Taichi]
"Young adults are what man among men expected
to be. An ideal adult form I am to be."
"A super elite flawlessly working, adored by
subordinates and withered by superiors."
"And spend the weekend on the beach, forgetting
about the clutter of the city. At night, read
Byron's poetry book while enjoying some cognac."

[Miki]
"Not only do you have delusions on girls
but your future self too."

[Taichi]
"Don't speak well of me like that, Miki."

[Miki]
"Ah, no, I wasn't."

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm just a cadet right now whose buds haven't
even sprouted."
"And surely Kiri will be all over me once it
sprouts..."

[Miki]
"An ugly duckling basically turns into an ugly adult
when they grow up."

She said with a smile.

[Taichi]
"That's so mean!"

I broke down into tears.

[Taichi]
"I just need some hope to live, that's all."

[Miki]
"There there, don't cry."

[Taichi]
"Anyhow, pretend like you made this sandwich
and have Kiri eat it."

[Miki]
"Um, I mean no offense even though you're doing so
much, but..."
"You didn't lace it with anything, did you?"

[Taichi]
"..."

She barely had trust in me, so little that it felt good.
