I wondered if Kiri was on her way to school.
I didn't recall seeing her on Monday.
I was on the fourth floor. The first-year classroom.
Kiri was there.
She was gazing out the window.
She looked so frail.
Despite that, her form was vibrant and full of life.
Viewing her from behind and to the side,
I caught a glimpse of unhappiness in her profile.
Her silky black hair was across her face, as if to
conceal her expression.
Such youthful vitality hidden behind a thin,
fragile veil... She was a lovable young woman.
Should she ever shatter, her fragments would likely
hurt those around her as well.
Still, seeing her narrow frame and delicate back,
she did indeed look quite defenseless...
She was like prey in the eyes of a hunter.
She didn't even notice that I was there.
