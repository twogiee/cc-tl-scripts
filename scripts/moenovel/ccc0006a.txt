I was in the middle of walking up the hill
when...

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

I heard a sound of tires screeching against the
road.
My danger signal lit up.

[Taichi]
"As if I'll let you!!"

I brilliantly jumped aside.
*CRASH*

[Taichi]
"Waahhh!!"

I rolled around.

[Nanaca]
"Eeeee!!"

She flew away as if she was on a wire stunt.
She maintained her posture despite colliding into
the roadside trees and crashing into the ground,
face first.

[Nanaca]
"Sorry Taichi!!"

[Taichi]
"How does she know my name..."

[Nanaca]
"Have you forgotten?"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Our eyes met.

[Nanaca]
"Have you forgotten about me?"

[Taichi]
"Uh."

I forgot.
Let's just say I had amnesia.
Maybe I was her lifesaver or something in
the past.
Customary Diligence.
Taichi Keyword:
"Customary Diligence"
To challenge head on with a standard attitude.

[Taichi]
"I only permit of SF. Even if you're a childhood
friend I promised to marry 10 years ago, I won't
pardon you."

I spoke with a cold air.

[Nanaca]
"Heheh."

She was a cute girl.
But also a little weird.
Or obviously weird.
But since I was a useless human, I still thought
that she was cute.

[Taichi]
"Mm."

I squeezed.
I grabbed her boobs.

[Nanaca]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

I kept squeezing.
I could feel it.
But what was this feeling.

[Taichi]
"Is it silicon? Is it really silicon?"

[Nanaca]
"Aha."

*WHAM*

[Taichi]
"Aha."

I'd only just been sent flying.

[Taichi]
"So, what's your name?"

[Nanaca]
"You're quick to recover."

[Taichi]
"I'm used to it."

[Nanaca]
"My name is Nanaca."

[Taichi]
"Nanaca?"

[Nanaca]
"Yep. I'm Nanaca."

She gracefully greeted me by pinching the
sides of her skirt.
I copied her.
It was a mirror image.
A mirror image of two stupid people...

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm going to school so would you like to
walk?"

[Nanaca]
"Okay!"

She was wearing a uniform I'd never seen before.
She must be from a school in another neighborhood.
She looked quite athletic.
She followed along well without staggering
even though I walked slow.
At first sight, she looked like an energetic,
beautiful young girl.
Like she possessed energy to personally come
wake me up every morning.

[Taichi]
"Heheheh."

Wonderful.

[Nanaca]
"Aren't you upset that much?"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaca]
"With the world having come to this."

[Taichi]
"I am..."

There was no way I wouldn't be.

[Taichi]
"I just don't show it."
"Personally, the less people there are, the more I
feel as if I've been stripped to the core."

[Nanaca]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I can put up with it now because I know 
everyone's still here."

[Nanaca]
"Right."
"You must hate yourself."

[Taichi]
"I'm not saying I hate myself... Well, I don't
really know to be honest."
"I can't make sense of it. Everything's starting to
seem so trivial."
"It hurts a little though."

Nanaca looked sad.

[Taichi]
"Ah, I should stop."

I joked around, despite the situation.

[Taichi]
"I've decided that when I make a girl cry,
it's because of sexual harassment."

I wiped her tears.

[Nanaca]
"I wasn't crying though."

[Taichi]
"You looked like you were about to."

[Nanaca]
"But your decision of sexual harassment... That's
sickening."

[Taichi]
"It's an expression of affection."

[Nanaca]
"You call your perverted pranks affection?"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

I puffed my chest out in pride.

[Taichi]
"With a heart for admiring beautiful things,
I play perverted pranks."
"Because personalities, no matter how typical they
may be, still belongs to that one unique person."
"It's human nature."
"And besides, I don't have any qualifications to
love anybody..."

I said too much.
There were times when my logic let loose because I
was also only a human.
Phew.

[Nanaca]
"Ohh..."
"I haven't heard that kind of opinion before."

[Taichi]
"Haven't heard before?"
"Have we really met in the past?"

[Nanaca]
"We have."

She looked down.

[Taichi]
"When?"

[Nanaca]
"I wonder..."

[Taichi]
"So it's a secret..."

[Nanaca]
"I guess so."

[Taichi]
"Muahahah, if you don't confess I'll lift your skirt
up."

[Nanaca]
"Do it and I'll shove you again."
"You like that don't you."

[Taichi]
"Err..."

She was tough.
Even sexual harassment didn't bother her.

[Taichi]
"I give up."

[Nanaca]
"Oh?"

[Taichi]
"It's no fun playing with someone's skirt
if they don't react."
"Ahh, to think that I, Taichi Kurosu, who prides
himself on empty, superficial dialogue,
said something so serious."

I kept walking.

[Nanaca]
"That's sad."

Her voice sounded fairly distant.
I felt uncomfortable.
So I turned around.
She was at an almost impossible distance away from
me.
Even though we were literally just walking side
by side just a few seconds ago.
20 meters. A distance that was impossible
to travel in a second.

[Taichi]
"What..."

[Nanaca]
"Taichii!"

She cried sorrowfully. It cut through my heart.
Nanaca was crying for real this time.

[Nanaca]
"I don't know if that's a good thing or not!"
"But if you wish to change the world back to the way
it was..."

She pointed straight at me.
No, behind me.
School?
No... The mountains.
It was the mountain trail we took to go to camp.
It was mostly animal trails, but it was the fastest
way to get out of the summit.
Then beyond that...
There was a small shrine.
I didn't know what was enshrined in there.
It looked like an old, run-down, small shrine.
Maybe it was a shrine for people who worshiped the
god of disobedience.
But now, it looked completely abandoned.
I wondered what was in there.
With trivial thoughts running through my mind,
I turned back to Nanaca.
But she was gone.
Along with her bike.

[Taichi]
"..."

The new school term was quiet, with not even a
cicada singing.
