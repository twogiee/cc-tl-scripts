[Taichi]
"Uhh."

That night I was busy writing.
I wasn't getting anywhere with any of it.
The storyline was so predictable.
But I had to keep at it.

[Taichi]
"It lacks in color."

Of course.
What if I got Misato to have a read through it?
I wasn't going to waste any time.
I left straight away.
I reached her house.
I knocked on the door but no one answered.

[Taichi]
"Misatooo!"

Still, no one answered.

[Taichi]
"Your Taichi is here!!"

Silence.
Maybe she was out.

[Taichi]
"..."

She couldn't possibly still be at school could she?

[Taichi]
"Ohh, she's here!"

[Misato]
"Ah, Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Took your time!"

[Misato]
"S-sorry."

[Taichi]
"Whoa..."

It seemed like she was setting up the antenna.
Just casually.

[Taichi]
"Surely you can't do anything when it's this
dark outside?"

[Misato]
"It was bothering me... Is that wrong of me?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."
"If you have the spare time to do things like that,
why don't you take a look at my manuscript?"

[Misato]
"Oh, did you already finish it?"

[Taichi]
"It's still in progress, but I wanted your opinion."

[Misato]
"Oh, but I can't read anything because it's
too dark."

[Taichi]
"Maybe."
"How about you call it a day now and go home?"

[Misato]
"Uhh... But I only have to do a little more."

[Taichi]
"Mimi..."

[Misato]
"Just a few more tweaks!"

[Taichi]
"You won't gain anything from rushing to finish it."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Just do it slowly. There's nothing wrong in that."
"There's plenty of time to finish it."
"And the more you rush it, it'll fail on you just
as fast."
"Would you be able to deal with that, Misato?"

[Misato]
"Er..."

She looked like she was about to cry.
I felt my spine go numb.
Then I realized I had blurted out too much.

[Misato]
"Maybe I'm running away."

[Taichi]
"Maybe."

[Misato]
"Does it look like that?"

[Taichi]
"It looks like that."
"You're running away by forcing yourself to work."

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"You're giving yourself more work to pre-occupy
yourself."

[Misato]
"Is it that obvious?"

[Taichi]
"I thought that was normal."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"What you're doing isn't that unusual."
"Everyone needs to take their mind off things once
in a while. We all need a way to escape"
"But for those who need to desperately escape
like you...it's hard."
"It'll take a toll on you."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It's like you're over 30 years old."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Evidence of the wounds you've inflicted on
yourself."

[Misato]
"..."

Silent affirmation.
I kept talking.

[Taichi]
"It's okay to work by yourself. But if you end up in
a sticky situation...it'd be dangerous to be alone."
"If anything were to happen, being on this rooftop
in itself is dangerous."
"Are you following me?"

[Misato]
"Yeah... I am."

She said so disdainfully.

[Taichi]
"You're making me really worried."

She took her glasses off.
Then she pat her teary eyes with the back of her
fingers.

[Misato]
"I've been insecure enough to even make you
worry, Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"Haha... That's not the point I was trying to make."

[Misato]
"Ahahah."
"I was surprised that you could say things like
that."

I wiped her tears.

[Misato]
"Thanks."

[Taichi]
"Don't mention it."

[Misato]
"It's just that... I feel like we're all falling
apart. And everyone's going to vanish."

[Taichi]
"I haven't vanished, right?"

[Misato]
"Well, that's cause your motives are...different."

She saw through me.

[Taichi]
"Well..."

[Misato]
"But I might have become a little stubborn."

[Taichi]
"And to be clear, it doesn't seem like you're
really alone."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

I showed her the package I picked up under the
water tower.

[Misato]
"A gift?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."
"They're just curry rolls, though."

[Misato]
"Oh..."

She put her hands up to her mouth.

[Taichi]
"He's been pretty hard to spot lately, too. Seems
like he's a little nervous."
"That idiot can't stand watching his friends getting
into trouble."
"Yet he manages to bring spoiled curry rolls
like this."

[Misato]
"But you seem happy, Pekke."

[Taichi]
"Do you want some?"

She nodded ever so slightly.
We both ate the curry rolls together.
