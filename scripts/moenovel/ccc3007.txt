[Shinkawa]
"You know, I lost my memory."

He said, suddenly.

[Taichi]
"You're like the main character of a game."

[Shinkawa]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing, forget it."

Shinkawa spoke.
The fact he had no memory of his childhood.
The fact he was afraid of needles.
The fact he feels horribly scared in the forest
shadows.
Something happened to him, long ago.
But, he didn't know the details.
Kiri's parents didn't tell him about it either.
Lastly, Yutaka Shinkawa had no family.
Everything was covered in darkness.
At the end, he was sent to Gunjo with Kiri.

[Taichi]
*munch munch*

I listened while I devoured a pizza.
It was a delivery pizza.
Back then, I had money and would always order food
for lunch.
To not cause stress to the mentally ill, Gunjo's
school rules were not too strict.
They thought if they stopped having pizza delivery,
it might anger some students.
In a school that isolated you for treatment, if you
had self-consciousness the rules became meaningless.
Like prisoners on a prison island...

[Taichi]
"Hmm...is that so. Lost memory. Hmm."

I pondered. Then...

[Taichi]
"No problem!"

[Shinkawa]
"Good... I figured you would say that..."

[Taichi]
"I don't mind you with your lost memory, but if you
had it, I wouldn't like it."

[Shinkawa]
"..."

And into that dull atmosphere came Kiri.

[Kiri]
"You two hanging out again?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, Kiri-baby!"

[Kiri]
"Just call me Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Okay, Kiri-baby."

[Kiri]
"It's Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Okay, Ms. Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Call me by my proper name..."

[Taichi]
"What am I supposed to do..."
"Right, Yutaka?"

[Shinkawa]
"..."

He was asleep.

[Taichi]
"Man, he sleeps fast."

[Kiri]
"He's always been like that."
"It's like an after-effect or something..."

[Taichi]
"From losing all his memories?"

[Kiri]
"...Did you hear from him?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, just now."

[Kiri]
"Well, then I guess he trusts you."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Kiri]
"We never had friends in our old school.
Neither my brother nor I."

That kind of thing was common.
Especially since the results of the adaptation test
leaked.

[Kiri]
"Even my friends betrayed me... I couldn't
trust anyone anymore..."
"Even though we'd hurt no one, they all hurt us."

[Taichi]
"You've had to bear your fangs."

[Kiri]
"If we're attacked, we have to protect ourselves."

[Taichi]
"That's a way to think too."
"But this is a world where beasts that protect
themselves get shot by guns."

[Kiri]
"...But we're humans."

She said it with a low tone.
Such anger.
Kiri was just too straightforward for this day and age.

[Taichi]
"Among them...there are those who aren't human."
"Sometimes, don't you think those around you aren't
worth it?"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I do sometimes. Rarely though. But if you end up
thinking like that it's over."
"We just have to keep living on though. Even if you
have to force yourself to act like a friend to these
normal people... It's to live on."

[Kiri]
"Is that why you do weird things?"

[Taichi]
"Never thought that far."
"...But there are times we have to."

[Kiri]
"Wait, me too?"

[Taichi]
"You want to survive, don't you?"

[Kiri]
"I..."
"I..."

She put her head down and wrapped her arms around
herself.

[Kiri]
"This whole world...frightens me...so much..."

[Taichi]
"What scares you about it?"

[Kiri]
"The evil..."
"The evil within people..."
"No one...is kind...so little kindness."

She trembled.
It was understandable.
She never wished to come here.
She had to come here.
The country made her do so.
She had no other choice.

[Kiri]
"I thought if humans disappeared, they'd just
vanish... There'd be nothing in this world."
"The whole world is filled with nothing, so it's
rare when there's something!"
"I always think about getting washed away by this
nothingness..."

[Taichi]
"Are you talking about, human extinction like in
science fiction?"

[Kiri]
"No, not like that... Not something that has a
reason..."
"It's like you wake up and everything was a dream."
"This whole world is just people hating each other...
It's terrifying..."
"But when I think, someday...everything
vanishes...and in this small world...I'm the only
one left..."
"I...I..."

[Taichi]
"Kiri Sakura."

I called her.
She was so sullen.

[Kiri]
"Oh...sorry."

[Taichi]
"Scared of the evil within...and being alone...huh."

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"Sit down and eat some pizza."
"Since my eating partner fell asleep."

[Shinkawa]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

She slowly sat down, but didn't take any pizza.
Her expression seemed to wriggle back.
She dazed off a bit.

[Taichi]
"After all that happened, you were sent to a penal
colony..."

[Kiri]
"A penal colony? Is that what this place is?"

[Taichi]
"Pretty much."
"But there's no evil or bullying. Look."

I pointed to everything around us.
It was noon.
Everyone was gathering their own food and eating.
No one got together, they all ate alone.
No conversations.
Only Shinkawa and I were talking.

[Taichi]
"Everyone's in their own zone."
"In a way, we all have the strength to live alone."
"No need for dependency, everyone's independent."
"Everyone is completed as is."

[Kiri]
"That's...not right though."

[Taichi]
"If you're incomplete and try to make connections
with other people, mistakes will happen."
"It even happens among normal people."
"That's why if you become complete, people should
stay alone."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you going to eat?"

[Kiri]
"I...can't eat food that other people touched..."

[Taichi]
"Are you a germaphobe?"

[Kiri]
"Especially, when a guy touches the food..."

[Taichi]
"So you're afraid of guys too?"

[Kiri]
"No...not like that... Just, guys seem...so
unclean..."

[Taichi]
"Not all guys are like unclean you know..."

She seemed like an adolescent girl being too aware
of the other sex.
It would easily turn into hostility, but when calm they become shy.

[Kiri]
*squirm*

Just like she was now...
That meant, on the other side of the coin, she was
probably hyper-interested in what sex was like.
Yay.

[Taichi]
"What the hell am I thinking..."

But I couldn't rob Yutaka of his potential future
wife.

[Kiri]
"Hey, so what we were just discussing..."
"It may not be evil...but this school... It seems
that the 'nothing-ness' here is so vast... Even if I
try to talk, no one talks to me."

[Taichi]
"They're not ignoring you. Their rules are just
different."

[Kiri]
"Rules...?"

Her doubtful repetition of what I said made her look
so much younger.
I realized, that was the true Kiri.
This shy girl, who becomes nervous when she talks.

[Taichi]
"They're operating on different channels... It's
difficult to contact them..."

It was hard to explain.

[Taichi]
"You and I have a normal psychological base. We have
different rules compared to those who don't have a
normal psychological base."
"Once you understand their rules, you'll be able to
talk to them."

[Kiri]
"How can I...find those rules..."

[Taichi]
"You have to be observant... For example..."

I moved closer to a sullen girl with glasses.
She and I had traded before.
I clapped.
She looked over to me.
I showed her a slice of pizza.

[Girl]
"..."

She showed interest.
She went to grab it.
I backed up and she backed off a bit.
A radius of 30 centimeters. That was her personal
space.

[Girl]
"..."

She understood, and raised her lunch box to me.

[Taichi]
"Okay."

I got a fried egg from her.
In exchange, I gave her the pizza.

[Girl]
"..."

She started eating it.

[Taichi]
"Just like that."

[Kiri]
"What was that?"

[Taichi]
"She likes trading things."
"Other than that, she only cares about her own
world. That's why she has no interest in anything
outside of a 30 centimeter radius."
"Also, she is really good with simple math. On top
of that, she can answer the date and day of the week
up to a hundred years in the future."
"I guess she really loves numbers and calculation."

[Kiri]
"Does that make her happy?"

[Taichi]
"Sure."
"Each person has their own definition of happiness."

[Kiri]
"...I don't like it."
"It may not be evil within her, but I don't like it."
"I mean...people are here...and each one seems
like they're on their own prison island."
"I don't like it."

[Taichi]
"..."

It was almost as if...
Kiri wanted someone to care for her...
Almost like she was screaming for it...

[Taichi]
"That's your scar..."

[Kiri]
"Huh..?"

Shinkawa groaned.

[Taichi]
"Looks like big brother is waking up."
"Do you like Yutaka?"

[Kiri]
"What... What are you talking about?"

She blushed.

[Kiri]
"No...I mean...it's different."

[Taichi]
"Easy to tell."

[Kiri]
"I told you, it's different."

[Taichi]
"Must be nice to be Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"What?"

Yutaka woke up silently.
He rubbed his eyes.

[Shinkawa]
"Dang...I fell asleep again... Where's my pizza?"

[Taichi]
"I ate it all."

[Shinkawa]
"What the...?"

He looked shocked.

[Taichi]
"I didn't think you'd ever wake up."

He groaned deeply.
But he didn't look like he was going to complain.

[Shinkawa]
"..."

He looked interested in something else.
He looked at me.
Then at the blushing Kiri.
He put his arms together and thought.
Then he looked up at Kiri again.

[Shinkawa]
"Okay, I see...have you settled on a marriage date?"

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow."

[Kiri]
"I'M NOT MARRYING YOU!"

Aaand that was a thing that happened.
