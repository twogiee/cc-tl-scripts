[Taichi]
"Hey, it's little Miss Wishy Washy."

[Touko]
"Wha...?"

[Taichi]
"I'll give you this."

I gave her my sandwich from earlier that morning.
Touko just kept staring at me.

[Touko]
"What is this?"

[Taichi]
"A sweet bun."

[Touko]
"No it's not! It's a sandwich!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, so you know, then."
"Here."

*shove*

[Touko]
"Stop it."

She pushed it away.
The sandwich fell.
I picked it up.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating well?"

[Touko]
"Like I need to tell you."

She spun around.

[Taichi]
"It's tough having to look out for yourself, right?"

[Touko]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"You want others to worry about you."
"You want to feel fulfilled."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I'm worried about you a little."

She glared at me.

[Touko]
"You got some nerve."
"If you're worried, why, then, why?!"

She lost her temper.

[Taichi]
"I wasn't trying to make you angry or anything."

*wham*
I staggered.
It didn't hurt a bit.

[Touko]
"Aw..."

She fell to the ground after her attack.

[Taichi]
"Hello?"

[Touko]
"Hm..."

She was pale, covering her eyes.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

I crouched down next to her.

[Touko]
"Don't call my name like you know me..."

She said in a thin voice.
Her face broke a sweat instantly.

[Taichi]
"Are you hurt anywhere?"

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hey, there's no time for that. Let's call a truce."

There were no doctors around anymore anyway.

[Taichi]
"Touko!"

[Touko]
"I can't see..."

She went blind?
It made me shiver.

[Taichi]
"Anything else?"

[Touko]
"I feel sick. I'm so dizzy I might puke..."

[Taichi]
"Are you going to?"

[Touko]
"No..."

[Taichi]
"Then lie on your side."

I urged her.
Touko didn't resist.

[Taichi]
"How are your eyes?"

[Touko]
"Completely dark..."

She might have gone blind.
But that wasn't the worst thing.
It was better than a disease or some serious organ
injury.

[Taichi]
"Just stay calm and try not to panic."

[Touko]
"I-I'm fine."

[Taichi]
"Anything out of the norm with your body in the past
few days?"

[Touko]
"None."

[Taichi]
"Were your eyes contaminated at all?"

[Touko]
"No."

Hmm.
So it really was all of a sudden.

[Touko]
"Oh..."

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Touko]
"My vision is slightly coming back."

What a relief.

[Taichi]
"Then it's anemia."

[Touko]
"Anemia?"

[Taichi]
"Temporary blindness is one of the symptoms. It's
likely why you felt ill too."

[Touko]
"I see..."

[Taichi]
"Do you still feel ill?"

[Touko]
"It's getting a little better..."

[Taichi]
"Are you really eating well?"

[Touko]
"..."

The silence meant no.

[Taichi]
"Don't you have the appetite?"

Touko slowly sat up.

[Touko]
"I always don't in the summer."

[Taichi]
"But you can't let that happen to you again,
got it?"
"What did you eat today?"

[Touko]
"..."

So she had nothing.

[Taichi]
"Here, sand and witch."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"A sandwich."
"It's from a fairy tale, eating sand and witch
together."

A nice lie that might trick some origin and
etymology snobs.

[Touko]
"..."

Touko rubbed her eyes.

[Taichi]
"How're your eyes?"

[Touko]
"They're okay now."

[Taichi]
"Good. Here."

Touko slowly grabbed the sandwich, as if her hand
was water-leveled.

[Taichi]
"Good girl."

[Touko]
"I'm not some pet..."

Even her retort was halfhearted.

[Taichi]
"It's homemade."

She unwrapped it and took a small bite.

[Touko]
"It's stale."

[Taichi]
"It is from this morning."

[Touko]
"It's big and hard to eat."

[Taichi]
"It was made for me."

[Touko]
"Too much mustard."

[Taichi]
"I like it that way."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Does it taste bad?"

[Touko]
"No, it's good."

[Taichi]
"Then take your time."

[Touko]
*sob*

She sobbed.
She was mortified.
Phew.

[Touko]
"Oogh..."

She covered her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Do you need to puke?"

She shook her head.
She overdid herself and swallowed it.

[Touko]
"I want something to drink."

[Taichi]
"Here's my water bottle."
"An essential for the end of the world."

I handed it to her.

[Touko]
"..."

She hesitated for a long while.
Then she put her mouth directly on it.
Then bottoms up.
Her throat protruded as she took in the water.

[Taichi]
"Are you not drinking either?"

[Touko]
"There's no water coming out the faucet."

[Taichi]
"How about Tazaki Mart?"

[Touko]
"I went there..."
"But I tripped on my way back and it all fell down
the hill."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you a clumsy one."
"You should've headed back to the store and got
more."

[Touko]
"If I did, I needed to leave another note."
"What if someone saw me..."

[Taichi]
"Say what?"

Just for that?
Just for what others might think?

[Taichi]
"Your life should come first!"

[Touko]
"But..."

She looked like she was about to cry.

[Taichi]
"That's a bit too silly, Touko."

[Touko]
"I'm delicate!"

[Taichi]
"That doesn't make sense when everyone's gone."

Nothing needed permission.
There were only pursuing.
The power to live.
That's the purest essence of a person.
Every necessity was taken over by despised desire.
Touko didn't seem to have that.
No.
It was something I always knew about.
It was Touko's weakness.
I got it.
She was already at her limit.
The world ended and her family in that mansion were
all gone.
She was all alone.

[Taichi]
"We have to live with just the eight of us from now
on."

[Touko]
"..."

Her silence was oppressive.

[Touko]
"Everyone's going to die."

[Taichi]
"We surely will."

Death was something no one could escape from.

[Taichi]
"The problem is how, and when we will die."

[Touko]
"But...people just disappeared. That's impossible..."

[Taichi]
"But this is our reality."

I thrusted.

[Taichi]
"The world has taken out people. We are with
each other now."

[Touko]
"I can't handle it..."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

This flow...
I supposed it couldn't really be helped.
I willingly got close to her.
The kind of relationship I wanted with Touko
wasn't anything sweet like honey.
But there wasn't an option for me to leave a girl so
distraught behind.
Part of the way with her was fine.
But...what would happen at the end?
What to do?
What do I do?
There was no escape at that point for sure.
Even if the route I chose to take with her collapsed.
This time I had to follow it to the very end.
Even when I'm tormented by the pain of maturity.

[Taichi]
"If you can't handle it no matter what."

[Touko]
"What?"

Touko responded sensitively.
She shut her mouth.

[Touko]
"No matter what?"

[Taichi]
"Well, no, you can eat all of that."

I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Hey..."

[Touko]
"Hugh?"

Touko responded as she bit into the sandwich.

[Taichi]
"Why do you think the humanity vanished?"

I looked out the window.
And I asked without expecting any answers.

[Touko]
"It didn't."

An outrageously philosophical answer returned.

[Touko]
"It just diluted and vanished."
