I dared to double-cross myself.
A challenge to destiny.

[Taichi]
"Miki, I don't like when things happen just as
expected."

[Miki]
"I see."

[Taichi]
"So I'm going to fight it."

[Miki]
"So brave."

She said it like she didn't care.

[Taichi]
"Nah, never mind."

I said just on a whim, and recklessly going through
puberty.

[Taichi]
"Just kidding, pressing the explosive switch!"

I got to Miki's backside and reached for her bra
hook with my fingers!
*GRAB*

[Taichi]
"What!"

My fingers were stopped by Miki's fingers!
She just put her hands on her back without looking
behind.
What kind of reflexes and flexibility... But I
didn't overlook the tag on her bra that I
could see from the cuff of her shirt.

[Taichi]
"Then how about this!"
"Fishhook!"

I'll leave what fishhook is to your imagination,
but it's a disgraceful attack from behind while
in the air.
But!

[Miki]
*swoooft*

My hand was squeezed between Miki's thighs.
I couldn't lift my hand.

[Taichi]
"You blocked it!"

My plan has failed, but her thighs felt so good.

[Miki]
"Is that all you got?"

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

Miki had the energy of a comic book protagonist
who has gotten seven times stronger
in the short while she trained.
S-so strong!

[Miki]
"Now it's my turn."

Miki swayed into position.
It was like a dance.

[Miki]
"Prepare yourself!"

She took her stance.
Then instantly went below me.
She took her fingertips and went for my kneecaps,
and slowly started to spread it.

[Taichi]
"Ouuughhh?!"

It was so ticklish I couldn't stand.

[Taichi]
"Th-this move?"

[Miki]
"Heheheh, kneecaps are more sensitive
than you think."

[Taichi]
"So unexpected!"

No joke, it really was ticklish.

[Taichi]
"I'm...utterly defeated."
"And...my quota has been met."
