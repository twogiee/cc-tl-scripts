[Taichi]
"Hello, Miss Innocence."

Her whole body stiffened as I spoke.
Her nervousness was visible even from behind.
She slowly turned around.
Her movements loosened as she did so, and she formed
some semblance of an aggressive stance.
Thinking back on it, she had a very grave expression.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Kiri]
"What do you want...?"

Her voice was strained.
It came out as barely more than a whisper.

[Taichi]
"Nothing in particular, I just-"

[Kiri]
"Then would you please..."

She cut me off with her words.

[Kiri]
"Please, show yourself out."
