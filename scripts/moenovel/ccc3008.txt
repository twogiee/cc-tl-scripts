No one was around.
I opened my lunch.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

It was a lunch enough for two people, like usual.
I had nothing to do, so I went to the rooftop.
Kiri was there.
She was looking out through the chain fence.
A feeling of deja vu hit and returned me to a past
memory.
Summer was over.
The cicadas were deafening.
They made enough sound to knock you out.
The sound known to muster all the strength you
have left.
A summer tinted with all the life remaining.
Kiri was on the roof.
Alone.
She was crying.
You'd know even from behind by the way her 
shoulders were shaking.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi...?"

She didn't hide her tears.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka...fell from here..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

I knew.
Everyone did.
In this town.
Usually, when a student killed themselves by
jumping off a school, everyone talked about it.
The guardian would press the school questions as
to who caused it as they tried to expose the reason
into the light.
The school would also try to avoid responsibility.
But Gunjo didn't have those problems.
No one would question why, and the school didn't
have to try to get away with it.
Several people would take responsibility.
But the world didn't really care about the dangerous
boys and girls of Gunjo.
There were only a few who were saddened by it.

[Kiri]
"No one... No one grieved... No one knows how we all
feel and live... No one..."

She rarely got agitated like this.
A week had already passed since Yutaka's death.
Kiri was still grieving.

[Taichi]
"Hey Kiri... Do you think Yutaka was happy?"

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"Was he happy in his own way?"

A common question.
However...
This time it had an opposite meaning.

[Kiri]
"He...always had a hard time."

[Taichi]
"Did he really always have a hard time?"
"Were there no moments of happiness?"

[Kiri]
"That's..."

He definitely did.

[Kiri]
"When he became friends with you...he started to
laugh again."
"But he never recovered..."

Her tone strengthened.

[Kiri]
"He never recovered from all the sadness and pain
he's ever experienced."

[Taichi]
"Well then, are you saying that he had lived a
worthless life, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"N-not like that..."

[Taichi]
"Though I said it already... Sadness had no reason
to it."

I was lost.
On how to deal with Kiri.

[Taichi]
"You're free to cry."

I looked at the sky.
I instantly noticed the huge cumulonimbus cloud
moving above me that filled my sight pure white.

[Taichi]
"At least until the summer ends."

The cicadas roared loudly.
I wondered if Kiri realized the flood of emotions
behind my words.

[Kiri]
"Waaaaahhhhhhh!"

She looked down, grasped the bottom of my shirt,
and cried out.

[Kiri]
"My brother... Yutaka... He's gone... Gone..."

She sobbed.

[Taichi]
"..."

Yutaka.
She really loved her older brother.
The one-legged man who lived his life
prominently.
Kiri's parents...
Their faces showed a slight relief at his funeral.
I wondered if Kiri noticed that.
She must have realized.
Even through the harshest of times, they had
supported one another.
He was her other half.
Kiri was his other half.
Just like me.
Except for the fact that that was what Kiri chose
for herself.
Now all the emotion was sapping her power.
But when the sadness faded, she would search
for a new other half.
Yutaka and Kiri.
Two people of one mind and body.
Kiri wasn't responsible.
But I...I as a monster...felt I was.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

I put my arm around her back.
Because she was lost in emotions, she didn't notice.

[Kiri]
"Uhhhhnnngg..."

She slowly calmed down.
By then, I held her completely.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, are you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"You're lonely...right?"

[Kiri]
"Kurosu...?"

[Taichi]
"I'm empty...totally..."

I gazed downwards to her small face.
Her eyes that looked like two obsidian stones
glistened with tears.

[Taichi]
"I think...he was happy. He had you, and forgot all
of his pain."
"I think he died happy..."

I brought my face closer.

[Kiri]
"Hmm...?"

She looked a bit confused.
I brought my face closer and closer.
Then I stole a kiss.

[Kiri]
"Ah...?!"

She flailed at me with her arms.
But I held her strongly.

[Kiri]
"Mnnn..."

She held her breath.
I pushed her against the fence, and kept kissing her.

[Kiri]
"Hmmnn...no...I can't..."

The surprise kept her from thinking.
She didn't resist at all.

[Taichi]
"Are you lonely?"

[Kiri]
"Huh..?"

[Taichi]
"You're lonely, right?"

[Kiri]
"I...don't know..."

I kissed her again.
And again.

[Kiri]
"Nnnnn?"

She suddenly resisted.
She pushed me away.

[Kiri]
"S-stop it!"

[Taichi]
"..."

I knew I was smiling softly when I did it. I was
certain of it.

[Kiri]
"Y-you're..."

I watched the shock turn into disgust.

[Kiri]
"...!!"

She dashed away.
She passed by me.
The door behind me squeaked and closed.

[Taichi]
"Haha..."

I covered my face with my hands.
I knew now that this was bad.
My mouth was forming a cruel smile.
Kiri neglected me since.
She stopped coming to the club.
Miki tried to bring her forcefully, but she
avoided me.
We never talked, and became distant.
And that was what happened...
