But we had club activities, so...
Misato's blueprint.
I believed if we took care of that list of problems,
we would be set for broadcasting.
I believed in her.
Believe. Such a beautiful word.
Just enough to quench this thirst.
Initiated the work.
Work continued under hot conditions.
The sunlight didn't bother me.
Because my hair was white.
That alone made a huge difference.
So I continued on, even at high noon.
Soon after.

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

It was Kiri.
Standing by the fence, she gazed at the scenery.
She hadn't noticed me.
But I was making so much noise, so she
should have.

[Taichi]
"Hey! Kiri!"

I called out and...
Kiri turned lazily and started walking towards me.

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, nothing in particular..."

Kiri looked up at the antenna with curiosity.

[Kiri]
"You're really working for the club, huh."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I suppose."
"In this heat I'd like to go to the beach."
"We went last year. Do you remember?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"It was fun but I felt bad for Miki."

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

Very straightforward.
Rather, she seemed weird.

[Taichi]
"What's the matter?"

[Kiri]
"Youko..."

[Taichi]
"Has Youko been...watching you?"

[Kiri]
"Y-yes..."

Kiri's hands began to tremble.
Even though she was a tough girl.
She was scared.
She shrunk beyond recognition.

[Kiri]
"And..."
"And..."

Her voice was trembling.
I couldn't watch.
She was immature but beautiful like a piece of
glass-work.
So frail, as if she would break if touched.
Such a vague state... I didn't get her.
I had a grudge developed towards Youko.
Ugh, I was getting depressed again.
I was okay when my spirits were up.
But I got pretty down when they weren't.
I went deep.
Too deep for the sun to reach.
A place where you forget about the warmth of the
sunlight.
A place where feelings had no meaning.
If I was there too long, my heart would grow cold,
and all that would remain was the pure will to live.
As if living in the ocean depths.
But that could also be nice...
If I was the only man left on earth.
In that way, there was no need for pain.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, help with the club activities."

The sudden suggestion made Kiri's eyes
grow wide.

[Kiri]
"With club activities?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."
"I can't finish it alone, so give me a hand..."

I tried to convince her.
I really needed help, but there was also a part of
me that hoped for a glimpse of panties by having
Kiri work on the step-ladder.

[Taichi]
"Panties are nice..."

[Kiri]
"What did you say?"

[Taichi]
"This is an E-type antenna, right?"

[Kiri]
"I thought I heard you say panties."

[Taichi]
"I didn't say anything like that."

I started whistling.

[Kiri]
"So...what do you want me to do?"

[Taichi]
"You're going to help?"

[Kiri]
"You're ordering me, aren't you?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, well, yeah."

[Kiri]
"I owe you one anyway, so I'll help."

[Taichi]
"Yay!"

[Kiri]
"However!"

She shut me down with her strong attitude.

[Kiri]
"I'm absolutely not trying to reconcile with you,
okay?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, sure."
"That's just part of life."

[Kiri]
"Tell me what to do."

[Taichi]
"All right, have a look at this."

I gave her the blueprints.
Her face tightened up.
A minute later, she started to frown.
