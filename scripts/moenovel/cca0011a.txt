[Taichi]
"So, how about those club activities?"

[Misato]
"Oh, sure."

She stared right at me.

[Misato]
"Did you come here to assist me?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"Is that so."

Her gaze bored into me.
Then she smiled.

[Misato]
"Thank you very much, Pekke."

[Taichi]
"Just my duty as an imperial soldier."

I saluted.
She giggled.

[Misato]
"Unfortunately, it's going to be dark soon."
"Fun club time is over."

[Taichi]
"Booo."

[Misato]
"I'm sorry. I've decided to do it on my own, so
there wasn't really a set schedule."

[Taichi]
"But you can't finish this on your own. There's
still wiring to be done."
"And there's the power line, too."

[Misato]
"No worries."
"Women have to show guts."

[Taichi]
"Then men have to show love."
"Misato, I, I-"

I tried to scoot closer, and...

[Misato]
"Club hours are over!"

[Taichi]
"Ugh!"

Her arm pushed my face away and probably made my
face even uglier.
That last "ugh!" made me feel like I'd sunk as far
as I could go, to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.

[Misato]
"Right, let's go home. Although, we live in opposite
directions. Hahaha."

[Taichi]
"Something doesn't sit right."

[Misato]
"But you had a lot of fun today, no?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, I don't know."

[Misato]
"You touched my butt when you dug your face
into my boobs, didn't you?"

[Taichi]
"That was an accident."

[Misato]
"You even rubbed them around."
"With both hands, too."

[Taichi]
"Like I said, an accident."

[Misato]
"Hm, well, okay. If you say so."
"It tickled."

[Taichi]
"Misato, my safety is still on."

[Misato]
"Safety? What?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. I woke up suddenly this morning with that
feature."
"I am Taichi, suitable for all ages, and the most
juvenile of them all."

[Misato]
"Juvenile?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, and it's no picnic, let me tell you."

[Misato]
"So infringing copyrights and sexual harassment are
no longer your wheelhouse?"

[Taichi]
"Unfortunately."

[Misato]
"That is...troublesome."

[Taichi]
"It feels like having both my hands ripped off."
"But, that's okay."

I let out a chuckle and looked at the sky as if I
was in some corny TV drama.

[Taichi]
"My attitude towards you will still be wholesome."

[Misato]
"Good boy."

Then I got a hug again.
I was now, a wholesome boy.
I was no longer corrupt.

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry..."

[Misato]
"Heheh."

She let go of me.
She lent in slightly, the deepening orange dusk
behind her.

[Misato]
"I'll forgive you, but it's time to go home and
think about what you've done."
"Goodbye, Pekke."

I left the building and looked up at the rooftop.
The antenna was up.
And next to it...
...Was Misato, still there.
She was working.
Even though it was almost night time.
Working by herself.
Then I realized something.
She had gently turned down my help.
