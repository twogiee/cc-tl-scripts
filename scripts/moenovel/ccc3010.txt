I was conscious.
I felt the sensation of my eyes being like a
periscope.
It was three hours since my stomach issue.
I had slept.
Or maybe I froze up.
My capacity was already reaching the end.
I opened my eyes.

[Taichi]
"Miki...?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

She smiled.

[Miki]
"It's Miki."

[Taichi]
"I..."

[Miki]
"Oh, just sleep."

[Taichi]
"Can I put my head on your thighs?"

[Miki]
"As long as you don't try anything dirty."

[Taichi]
"If I do?"

[Miki]
"It depends on the extent of the sexual
harassment."
"If you try putting a hand under my skirt,
I'll shoot you."

[Taichi]
"I won't..."

[Miki]
"Okay then...lay your head on my thighs."

[Taichi]
"Got it."

Her thighs were warm and soft.
They smelled good.
The feeling of her skirt, and the thickness of the
thighs under them.
Pure bliss.

[Taichi]
"I feel like sleeping again."

[Miki]
"Go ahead then."

[Taichi]
"But that's no fun."

[Miki]
"Heheh."
"I was surprised... It looked like you passed out."

[Taichi]
"I was asleep."

[Miki]
"Just another crazy day."
"But when crazy things happen, you're the best."

[Taichi]
"Really...?"

[Miki]
"You're weird but interesting, everyday is like a
festival."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"I guess lately you've been really lonely."

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."
"There's no way the population went from six billion
to eight..."

[Miki]
"We're the last survivors of our species."

[Taichi]
"No...I don't think so."

[Miki]
"Wh-why not?"

[Taichi]
"Hah hah hah, you know why."

I grabbed on to her butt.

[Miki]
*stab*

I'd been stabbed.

[Taichi]
"Ow! What was that?!"

[Miki]
"A knife."

It was a combat knife.

[Taichi]
"That's dangerous! Why do you have it?"

[Miki]
"Kiri told me to protect myself with one."
"But what I stabbed you with wasn't a knife.
It was my pinky fingernail. Faked you out."
"Don't worry, there's no blood."

[Taichi]
"Oh, okay..."

I was relieved.
I wanted to see as little blood as I could.
I couldn't let her set me off like that.

[Taichi]
"I think Kiri's being too aggressive in arming people
so that they can defend themselves."

[Miki]
"I think so too."

[Taichi]
"The Flowers symbolizes peace after all."

I turned my head face down.
I buried my face between her thighs.
I nuzzled my face right into that little triangle
at the top of her thighs.

[Miki]
"Ah! Ah!"

[Taichi]
"I'm still in the gray zone...right?"

[Miki]
"If you do that, I'll initiate the appropriate
response!"

[Taichi]
"I feel like I've arrived at the entrance to an
enthralling palace."

[Miki]
"You're just playing with me. Well then!"

She took out an ear pick.

[Miki]
"An ear pick."

Good.
A perfect situation.

[Taichi]
"Please do... Nah, even if I say don't, do it!"

[Miki]
"Are you sure...?"

[Taichi]
"Take my ear's virginity!"

[Miki]
"That's not a good image..."

[Taichi]
"My heart's a-flutter."

[Miki]
"Well, if you really want me to."

[Taichi]
"Be...gentle..."

[Miki]
"I'll be careful."
"I don't think it will get you any cleaner, though."

Wha...?
She stuck it into my ear.
*clunk*

[Taichi]
"!!"

[Miki]
"I found a big one!"

*scritch*

[Taichi]
"Gyarrgg!"
"Pain! Pain!"

But she kept on going.

[Miki]
"Heh heh, this is fun! It's been a while!"

She's been thirsty to do this!

[Miki]
"There! And there!"

*scritch scratch*

[Taichi]
"Eeeeeeek!"

It wasn't that it hurt.
It was ear-torture, meaninglessly abbreviated,
"earture."
*scritch scratch*

[Taichi]
"My ear!"

I screamed like some mad chef, and tried to
wiggle away.

[Miki]
"Stop, it's dangerous if you move."

Miki repositioned herself.
I saw her panties for an instant.
I suddenly felt a brief euphoria.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

She wrapped a leg around my neck.
Her thighs surrounded my face.

[Taichi]
"What?!"

In this position...
I felt like I was in outer space.
Or rather "in-her" space, between those thighs.

[Miki]
"Let's do it this way. Heeh heeh..."

Her ear torture tool (ear pick) went in again.
*scratch!*

[Taichi]
"Yaaaoooowww!"

But my head couldn't move.
It felt good, but I couldn't get away. I didn't want
to get away, but I did.
It was heaven and hell.
Simultaneously!

[Taichi]
"Aphhhaghhaahhhummmphhhggh!"

Pain and pleasure.
They both danced around me, and I was tossed about.

[Miki]
"Whoa! I found the boss ear crud!
"I have to attack it!"
"Go! Go! Scramble! Here comes the ear cleaner!"

She sang out.

[Taichi]
"HH"
"Gaaaaaaahhhhhghhh!"

I screamed like some mad chef again.

[Miki]
"It...it won't come out! Then how about from the
other side!"

[Taichi]
"Gyaaaaaa!!!"

In that second, pain won out over pleasure.

[Taichi]
"That's not my ear drum! That's my brain!"

Not really, of course.
However, since it was so tightly stuck,
it had to be an important organ.
Please, Miki, don't pluck out that poor thing.

[Taichi]
"W-wait! That has to be an important organ!
In a human body, what you think is useless
may actually be important!"
"I mean, just like your double switches are in a
meaningful position!"

[Miki]
"Time for my drill attack!"

[Taichi]
"Noooooooo!"

I screamed for my ears.
My ear/brain!
I could hear it slowly peel off!

[Taichi]
"I'm highly against lobotomy!"

And then...
*pwip*

[Taichi]
"!!!"

It popped out of me with a spasm.
My head was stuck in her legs, and my limbs flailed
like worms.

[Miki]
"Yes, I got it... Whoa, it's huge... I won!"

I died...
But she finally released me.

[Taichi]
"I really enjoyed your legs and thighs and...there."

But she said...

[Miki]
"Now, let me work on your other ear."

[Taichi]
"Whaaaa?"

[Miki]
"I wonder if the other side has a big one like this
side."

My face was stuck inside her thighs.
Paradise!
And as I felt the flow of pleasure, again came the
pain.
She stuck the ear pick in again.

[Taichi]
"Gyaaaaahhhh!"

Her foreign body removal policy was something
to be feared!
Then...

[Taichi]
"Whooooaaahhh..."

The Great Stabbing of the Two Ears lasted over
ten minutes.
It was the longest ten minutes of my life.

[Miki]
"I'm so happy, so happy."
"You want to see what I cleaned out of you?"

[Taichi]
"No thanks..."
"Whoa, I can hear well now."

[Miki]
"You were really plugged up."

[Taichi]
"It's like a new world."

[Miki]
"You're the first one who enjoyed getting their ears
cleaned by me."

I bet...
No, I don't think I was either.

[Taichi]
"No, I guess because of my powerful desires,
I can say that I simply endured it."

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh."

I laughed loudly.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, were you searching for Kiri?"

[Miki]
"Oh, you know where she is? I couldn't find her."

[Taichi]
"She was here until three hours ago."

[Miki]
"I haven't been able to find her at all today."

[Taichi]
"Aww."

That was most likely because Kiri was emotionally
unstable.

[Taichi]
"Maybe she wanted to be alone."

The day Yutaka died. It was today.
Right, that's why...

[Taichi]
"You should just leave her alone today."

[Miki]
*sigh*
"Did she say something to you?"
"Or did you do something perverted to her?"

[Taichi]
"Of course not."

I denied it weirdly.

[Miki]
"Are you being honest?"

It was true that I did try.

[Taichi]
"I AM a gentleman."

[Miki]
"So you tried to, and then she chewed you up
and spit you out, I bet."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"Yup, that's it."

Like how disciples see through their masters.

[Taichi]
"Well, she said I'm crazy in a really skillful way."

[Miki]
"That's..."

[Taichi]
"It's true though."

[Miki]
"..."

I got a bit depressed.

[Miki]
"I...like you when you're in your nice mode, you
know?"

[Taichi]
"Are you giving me a back-handed compliment?
I'm a battle-lord, and I won't be deceived!"

[Miki]
"You're saying that with a smirk."

Ah! I gave it away!

[Taichi]
"Then will you marry me?!"

[Miki]
"Why am I getting proposed to while being lectured?"
"Well, yeah sure, I will."

[Taichi]
"What! Really?"

[Miki]
"If Kiri says it's okay."

[Taichi]
"That's rough!"
"Well, could we sign a contract now real quick?"

[Miki]
"That's what sucks about you, Taichi."
