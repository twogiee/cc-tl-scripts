I made it to the shopping street after tackling a
few hills.
There was no one in sight.
I could see Tazaki Mart.

[Taichi]
"..."

I gazed at the shop with a bit of hope in my heart.
But there was no sign of life.

[Taichi]
"He must be out again..."

Tazaki Mart had been unstaffed for a while now.
The owner, Goichiro Tazaki (47, single), was an
incredible train nerd.
Often he would open up the shop, then leave to go
take pictures of some local train somewhere.
Sometimes he'd show off his pictures and hang them
up, but it was kind of a drag.
Kids these days just didn't buy into the whole train
craze thing.
The shop was still open, even when he was out.
It was, basically, an unstaffed shop.
After not getting a job with Japan Rail in his 20s,
he'd turned into a real punk (on into his 30s), but
after his parents died he settled into placidity.
Other than the inheritance, I wondered what could
have changed the wild man into a gentle train nerd.
Whatever the case, the kind old man now ran a shop
that offered a rare endless tab, and was an
irreplaceable part of the neighborhood.
So it wasn't seen as strange that no one was
manning the register.
Now that I was there, I realized how thirsty I was.
I went deeper into the shop and got a bottle of
green tea.
I took out my notepad and began writing.
-Sep. 7, Green Tea: 130 yen,
Taichi Kurosu
I stuck it to the wall.
I saw that several others were already there.
-Sep. 3, Healthy GoGo Vegetable Juice: 110 yen,
Miki Yamanobe
-Sep. 3, Magnum Lychee: 110 yen,
Hiroshi Sakuraba
@"It's hot and spicy."
-Sep. 4, Bottled Water: 140 yen,
Misato Miyasumi
-Sep. 5, Healthy GoGo Vegetable Juice: 110 yen,
Miki Yamanobe
-Sep. 5, King du Doria: 110 Yen,
Hiroshi Sakuraba
@"It wasn't very good."
-Sep. 6, Healthy GoGo Vegetable Juice: 110 yen,
Miki Yamanobe
-Sep. 6, Pepper Policeman: 110 yen,
Kiri Sakura
They'd come to buy a bunch of stuff while we were
camping.

[Taichi]
"..."

When we got back, everyone had disappeared
from town.
TV, radio...all the media had gone dark, and
utilities like water and electricity were cut.
Everyone was stunned.
Mainly because we'd just gone through some emotional
back and forth that was a little hard to deal with.
We were tired, and not in any mood to talk.
We'd put off talking things through,
and split up.
Flash-forward to today...
It was the start of the new school term.
I headed to school like normal.
I opened the door.
The sense of another detainee spilled forth, and I
gently touched my cheek.
She was in a seat by the window.
The girl, elbows on the desk, glanced around.
Her long hair was gorgeous.
It was in precise order, kept so by effort that
bordered on neurotic.
You could tell from up close.
Her iron-willed control would never allow a single
frayed hair, or split end.
It sparkled when you touched it, and flowed like
fine dust through your fingers.
When we first met, she was equipped with
unbreachable guard.
She had an irresistible aura, along with an
invisible suit of armor.
I figured she had her reasons.
This was, after all, Gunjo Gakuin.
We had uncontrollable classmates.
Classmates like the walking dead.
Empty young boys and girls who saw only the world
inside their heads.
The number of us capable of actually maintaining a
normal conversation was small.
Emotionless security guards stood everywhere.
Our classrooms were bedlam.
It was a miserable view of the world, like wind-up
toys piled into a hill of corpses.
With an adaptation score of 46, survival for Touko
Kirihara meant struggling to protect the remaining
54\p of her humanity.
She maintained her self-awareness only through the
rejection of others.
From that viewpoint, the choice she made on first
entering this school had been the right one.
The Touko here now still resembled that girl.
Her ostentation, her bluster, her vanity.
That was the rundown of the person called Touko
Kirihara.

[Taichi]
"You actually came!"

[Touko]
"..."

Her gaze leapt outside the window.
The timing made her intentions clear...
She was intent on ignoring me.
