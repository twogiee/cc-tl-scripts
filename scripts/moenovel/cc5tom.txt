"Friendship is not asking anything in return."
That was why I decided to start a new club activity
that evening.
It was the least I could do for everyone.
I gathered up all of the food in town
and divided it evenly.
I felt that kind of club activity was needed.
Monday morning. A new term started today.
The new club activity also started today.
My pulse raced at the indiscretion.
Like an elementary school student before a typhoon
or heavy rain.
I might start skipping at any moment.
I would've done it if my leg felt better.
Nah, probably not.
I took a bit of a detour and headed to Tazaki Mart.
It was on the edge of the shopping street
and frequented by other students as well.

[Tomoki]
"Morning!"

The former athlete in me overdid it with the
greeting.

[Tomoki]
"Nobody here, huh."

Yesterday evening, we all checked out a major area
in town.
A sky with nothing but starlight.
None of the shops were lit up.
And yet, they were as open as they were during the
day.
It was an extremely strange scene to behold.
The two first year students were taken aback by it
all, and Kirihara pouted in anger.
My older sister just seemed nervous.
That's why they're utterly and completely useless.
Sakuraba folded his arms in thought.
Was he thinking about trivial garbage like usual?
Or seriously concerned for a change?
Hasekura was composed and calm.
No, that wasn't the word...
The more step-up word... Detached, maybe?
She wasn't agitated in the least.
She surveyed the town and disappeared
after whispering into Taichi's ear.
Guess she wanted to investigate a bit on her own.
Honestly, with someone like her...
It'd help if she'd be a leader and guide us.
Taichi hadn't changed at all.
He said stupid stuff to make people laugh
and teased the girls incessantly.
The same old Taichi.
Seeing Taichi like that calmed everyone's nerves a
bit.
We all lacked something.
That's why we had to do this together.
I just had to do what I could do.
Securing food was the first and foremost job
of the Life Maintenance Club.
The store was well-stocked with drinks,
alcohol, snacks, and chocolate.
We found canned-goods, packed foods, instant noodles,
and other instant foods.
Because the clerk hadn't been gone for long,
all of the goods were still fresh.

[Tomoki]
"A huge selection is great and all, but it's gonna
be tough to get this stuff and divided properly."

Numerous memos dotted the walls.
Looked like this shop had a rule where you write and
post the amount you owe when the clerk was gone.
The names of Taichi, Sakuraba, and the two first
year students were all there.
My older sister's name was there, too.
I remembered why I started coming here less.

[Tomoki]
"Guess we can just leave it as is."

Everybody knew there was food here.
They can all use whatever they need when they need
it.
I doubt any of them would hoard it all to themselves.
Even if things went south, I can't imagine
any of them being that stupid.

[Tomoki]
"All right, time to search for other areas."

The school cafeteria came to mind.
The place where Gunjo Gakuin students satisfied
their appetites.
A place with which I was very familiar.

[Tomoki]
"Oops. Guess I was wrong."

There was no food to be found in the cafeteria
kitchen.
Last night was when everyone disappeared.
And yet, ingredients should have been delivered
each and every morning.
In their place, we found mounds of seasoning and
cooking oil.

[Tomoki]
"We can make enough food for tens if not hundreds of
people with this!"

There may not be food, but there was at least
electricity and gas available.
We found some business-use ramen soup after that.
All we needed was hot water, and we'll have
cafeteria ramen back on the menu!

[Tomoki]
"Shocking. I was always a fan of the cafeteria
ramen."

Enough with these disappointing reveals, please.
Disappointed, I returned to the cafeteria only to
find the bread case.
Maybe the baker made a delivery yesterday!
I missed it because it was in a different spot
than usual.
I leapt with joy as I examined the case.

[Tomoki]
"What on earth is this..."

My expectations were always betrayed.
The bigger, the worse.
The case was nothing but curry rolls.
The students hated them, and there were always
leftovers.
Sakuraba was the only one with bad enough taste in
food to enjoy them.

[Tomoki]
"But there's still hope."

I checked the other cases, too.
They mostly contained curry rolls...
Curry rolls, curry rolls, curry rolls, curry rolls,
croquette rolls, curry rolls, curry rolls,
deep-fried rolls... About 90\p curry rolls.

[Tomoki]
"What was the cafeteria lady thinking? This is akin
to harassment. Maybe they thought a lack of options
would raise sales?"

I thought I'd found treasure, but it was more like
trash.
This felt like a colossal waste of time.

[Tomoki]
"They were carelessly tossed into the cases, too.
It's like a bread orgy in here."

Perhaps this was desperate ploy by the bakery in
response to how unpopular their curry rolls are.
It's like they just stuffed all of their unsold
bread in here.

[Tomoki]
"Still, this is precious food."

I put the bread case in a conspicuous location.
I bet somebody would eat it if they saw it.
Though I can only think of one person who would want
to.
Just seeing all those curry rolls was enough to
remind me of that awful flavor.
Where was Sakuraba the one time he was needed?

[Tomoki]
"He's always wandering about."

Sakuraba might be nowhere to be seen.
But the beauties were there to behold.

[Miki]
"Oh, there you are, Shima!"

She was awfully cheerful considering what went down
yesterday.

[Kiri]
"Hey..."

And she was on the alert.
It's a bit troublesome in a situation like this to
call for honed communication abilities.
It wasn't a specialty of mine.
So I just said what needed to be said.

[Tomoki]
"Have you seen Sakuraba?"

[Miki]
"Sakuraba? Haven't seen him. Nor do I want to."

[Tomoki]
"How mean of you to say."

[Miki]
"But we did see Taichi not long ago!"

[Tomoki]
"Taichi, huh. What was he up to?"

[Miki]
"Sexual harassment and kindness."

[Tomoki]
"The usual then."

[Kiri]
"Umm, Miki..."

Kiri's face showed annoyance.

[Miki]
"He was just fooling around."
"If you're looking for Taichi, your best bets are
the classroom or the rooftop."

Not that I was looking for him.

[Tomoki]
"What makes you think that?"

[Miki]
"Because that's where Kirihara or the club president
would be."

[Tomoki]
"Oh, I see. Makes sense."

[Miki]
"Statistically speaking, Detective Miki's profiling
has about a 50\p rate of success."

[Tomoki]
"Don't think statistics are relevant there, but
whatever. I'll check those places out. Thanks."

[Miki]
"You're very welcome."

[Tomoki]
"I'll tell you this to return the favor. There's
bread in the cafeteria."

[Miki]
"Really?"

[Tomoki]
"But it's pretty much all curry rolls."

[Miki]
"Oh, okay. Want any, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"That bread is..."

[Miki]
"I know, right?"

Too unpopular.
Guess I'll go tell Taichi about it.
Of course, tell him there's bread but not about
curry rolls.
It's not fair for me to have to be the only one who
is disappointed.
I found Kirihara in the classroom.

[Touko]
"What?"

Well, that's frightening.

[Tomoki]
"Have you seen Taichi?"

[Touko]
"He's probably up on the rooftop..."

[Tomoki]
"Gotcha."
"Say, Kirihara..."

[Touko]
"Whaddaya want...?"

[Tomoki]
"Never mind..."

A girl like her wouldn't give curry rolls
the time of day.
I didn't go up to the rooftop.
It wouldn't matter if I did.
That they're trying to fix that antenna on that
dangerous rooftop of all things.

[Tomoki]
"How foolish can you be."

A club activity where you hurt yourself and others
wasn't the way to go.
Life is precious and needs to be treated
with respect.
I'll stick to my own club activities, thank you.
I walked around looking for ingredients until
sundown.
I checked the shops around the school...

[Tomoki]
"Surprisingly empty."

Butchers, fish dealers, restaurants... All were
privately owned but had almost no food left to be
found.

[Tomoki]
"Maybe the day of the week or stocking is to blame."

Finding food was harder than I thought it'd be.
Thankfully, I had food waiting for me at home.
Rice in the rice cooker, bread in the cupboard,
and food in the fridge.
Every house should at least have some food in stock.
There was still plenty of time until everyone's
personal stock ran out.
I should search them carefully.
Yesterday was nothing but fool's errands.
Today, I needed to make smarter choices.

[Tomoki]
"Hmm."

I looked at the town map I found back home and
nodded.
I marked the stores I already visited with an X.
I tried the major supermarkets but found little
besides sealed foods, instant food, and dried goods.
And not much of it.

[Tomoki]
"I thought it'd be easier to find stuff."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Immoral Sister-Complex Club president. Are you
doing great?"

[Tomoki]
"It's the Life Maintenance Club..."

[Taichi]
"How are you doing?"

[Tomoki]
"Well enough. Trying to find supplies."

[Taichi]
"I see. Want me to help?"

[Tomoki]
"The king of food-snatching will be enough."

[Taichi]
"But why?! Tell me!"

[Tomoki]
"I just told you."

[Taichi]
"That's not the real reason."

I was startled a bit.

[Taichi]
"With me on board, the Immoral Sister-Loving Club
will transform into the Healthy Eroticism Club."

[Tomoki]
"You're so, so wrong. So wipe that stupid grin off
your face."

[Taichi]
"It'll be fine. We'll just make some memories
for the yearbook."

[Tomoki]
"Why are you so eager to help?"

[Taichi]
"Just thought I'd be a friend."

[Tomoki]
"I don't get where this is going."

[Taichi]
"Friendship is..."

[Tomoki]
"Not asking anything in return."

[Taichi]
"And that's why I want to join your club."

[Tomoki]
"It's just abrupt is all, and I don't need a sicko
like you."

Ugh. I was playing right into his hands.

[Taichi]
"Okay. So what exactly does the Super Ninja Club
do?"

[Tomoki]
"It's the Life Maintenance Club. Not that the name
matters, but still..."

[Taichi]
"We enter homes to find provisions. That's as
Japanese ninja as it gets!"

[Tomoki]
"Don't make it sound like robbery."

The stupidity continued.
Then I agreed to have him as an observer.
Having fun with Taichi wasn't what the club is about.

[Youko]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"Whoa! What's up?!"

Hasekura appeared out of thin air.
She was more of a super ninja than Taichi will ever
be.

[Youko]
"Taichi asked me to come."

[Tomoki]
"Is that right?"

[Youko]
"The kitchen garden should be your target
if it's food you're after."

[Tomoki]
"The kitchen garden..."

I hadn't thought of that.
Food was sold at the store.
But it wasn't grown there.

[Tomoki]
"A field would work just as well..."

[Youko]
"Yeah, but they're far away. Tough to harvest."

[Tomoki]
"You speak the truth."

I was annoyed at my own stupidity.

[Youko]
"After that comes household stocks."

[Tomoki]
"Yes... But only as a last resort."

Even with everyone gone, I still had a conscience...

[Youko]
"But it's only a matter of time. The wealthier
households would be our best bet."

[Tomoki]
"But how do we know which is which?"

The only wealthy households I knew were Sakuraba's
and Touko's.

[Youko]
"Look for security company stickers."

[Tomoki]
"Huh? Why?"

[Youko]
"They are houses with stuff to protect."

I see...
She said her piece and left.

[Tomoki]
"She's like an elusive little phantom..."

But in any case, everything she said was on point.
The logic strengthened my resolve... I'd feel even
better about it if we were related.
Afternoon activities went well, thanks to Hasekura's
advice.
I took everything I found to the school cafeteria.
I divided the easily damaged food up evenly.
I planned on delivering it to everyone's homes
later.
I felt relieved that my club activities
were paying off.

[Tomoki]
"Guess Taichi helped out after all."

The third day of Life Maintenance Club activities.
I found some fresh vegetables on the way to school.
I also found rice, pasta, crackers, and canned food.
I put what I could carry into my bag.
I also got a portable stove and a flashlight.

[Tomoki]
"Wish I had healthy legs right about now."

Health is important, overworking must be avoided.
There were no doctors to fix us up if we got hurt.

[Tomoki]
"Maybe I should start looking for medical supplies?"

But the nurse's office had plenty, and I wouldn't
know what to do with anything more complicated if I
had it.
I went to school while I thought about things, and
found Sakuraba gobbling down the curry rolls.

[Tomoki]
"Surprise, surprise..."

[Sakuraba]
"Tomoki. You better not be here for my rolls."

[Tomoki]
"Nope. Eat as much as you want."

[Sakuraba]
"Heh."

[Tomoki]
"You don't have to revel over it."

[Sakuraba]
"Curry rolls are one of the things I can't live
without."

[Tomoki]
"Well, there's other food if you get sick of them."

[Sakuraba]
"Nah."

[Tomoki]
"I already divided some up for you."

[Sakuraba]
"Is my share made up of curry rolls?"

[Tomoki]
"No."

[Sakuraba]
"Ugh... Then keep it."

[Tomoki]
"All right then. I'll let you get back to your
rolls."

I left Sakuraba and his curry rolls behind
and headed to class.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi. Are you here?"

He wasn't.
Kirihara was on the floor.

[Tomoki]
"Hey, Kirihara! You okay?!"

[Touko]
"Nngh..."

She breathed as I picked her up.

[Tomoki]
"Did something happen? Are you sick?"

[Touko]
"Leave me alone... It's none of your business."

Pale and sickly didn't make her any more pleasant.

[Tomoki]
"Everything is the Life Maintenance Club's business!"

[Touko]
"The hell? You slow or something?"

Kirihara's stomach growled.

[Tomoki]
"You hungry by chance?"

[Touko]
"...Shut up! Of course I'm not!"

Her face turned red as she said it.
I led the reluctant Touko to the cafeteria.

[Tomoki]
"Wait. I'll get something for you."

[Touko]
"Didn't I already tell you not to?"

[Sakuraba]
"What's wrong?"

[Tomoki]
"Kirihara collapsed from hunger."

[Touko]
"No I didn't..."

[Sakuraba]
"Here."

Sakuraba handed her a curry roll.

[Tomoki]
"That's awfully nice of you."

[Sakuraba]
"When push comes to shove, a real man
will part with his most prized possession."

He's a good guy. Even if strange. And stupid.

[Touko]
"I don't want it."

[Sakuraba]
"Why not?!"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, I'm not sure the sick should be eating this."
"Wait. I've got something good."

I searched the kitchen for sealed food
that can be cooked with hot water.

[Tomoki]
"Not okay if it's cold..."

I filled the smallest pot with bottled water and
boiled the water on the portable stove I found.
The container was a ramen bowl.

[Tomoki]
"Dinner is served, my lady."

[Sakuraba]
"Mmm. Looks good."

[Tomoki]
"It's not for you!"

[Touko]
"I told you, I don't want it!"

She's really a handful, isn't she?

[Taichi]
"Oh. You're all here."

[Tomoki]
"Good timing, Taichi. Get Touko to eat something."

[Touko]
"What are you talking about?!"

[Taichi]
"I've got some creamy white soup for her!"

[Touko]
"Cool it with the filth already!"

Taichi's presence alone had a positive impact on
Kirihara.

[Youko]
"No love birds allowed..."

[Touko]
"Ha-Hasekura?!"

Where did she come from...?

[Touko]
"It's not like that."

[Youko]
"I'm anti-love birds..."

[Taichi]
"Okay, Touko. Open wide."

[Touko]
"I-It's fine. I can eat on my own."

[Taichi]
"No, no. Come on now."

[Touko]
"Mmm!"

It was a bit tense there for a while, but Touko was
okay in the end.

[Taichi]
"Don't you have something to say, Touko?"

[Touko]
"Like what?"

[Taichi]
"To Tomoki."

[Touko]
"I didn't ask for his help..."

[Taichi]
"Whoa. How ungrateful can you be?"

[Tomoki]
"Settle down, now..."
"Friendship is..."

[Taichi]
"Not asking anything in return."

[Tomoki]
"And besides, it's part of my club activity."
"Kirihara."

[Touko]
"What...?"

[Tomoki]
"I'm sorry. I should have delivered your food
yesterday. It's just that you live far away."

I handed her food in a cardboard box.

[Tomoki]
"Come back for more if you run out."

[Touko]
"It's too heavy..."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi will help you carry it."

[Taichi]
"Why me?"

[Tomoki]
"Because you joined the Life Maintenance Club
yesterday."

[Taichi]
"I entered out of frustration. And I'm already
regretting it..."

Taichi doing it despite not wanting to
was part of his good side.

[Touko]
"Shima..."

[Tomoki]
"W-what...?"

[Touko]
"Thanks..."

Quiet as it was, I could still hear it.
Thursday.
With half the week behind me, I got used to my club
activities.
I got provisions on the way to school.
To that end, I made stops on my way home
the day before.
A house where they grew vegetables.
A field left behind for urban planning.
I found the things we needed in places that I never
bothered to pay attention to before.
I harvested them the following day.
I was reluctant at first, but now I had no problems
trespassing on other's properties to get what I
needed.

[Tomoki]
"It's kind of scary to be honest..."

Next, the opposite route to school.
I headed to the points I marked on the map.
I made several round trips to get food.
And then I took it to the cafeteria.
I checked the expiration dates and quality of
preservation as I sorted them.
I took breaks when I got tired.
I tried to eat anything that was about to go bad.
I returned to work.
I chose the food to be divvied out and divided it
into eight portions.
Sakura made a rare appearance as I was doing it.

[Kiri]
"So, uh..."

She handed me the cardboard box I'd delivered to her
house the previous day.

[Tomoki]
"Maybe I overdid it."

That...kind of stung.

[Kiri]
"No, it's not that."

Sakura opened the box.
It was filled with something other than the food I'd
delivered.

[Kiri]
"I found it on my way to school. Please divide it up
for everyone."

[Tomoki]
"Are you sure?"

[Kiri]
"I heard from Miki that you helped Kirihara
yesterday. We also want to contribute to your club
activities."

[Tomoki]
"I see. Thanks."
"I've got more for you today, so take it with you."

Soon after, Yamanobe showed up, and the two chatted
as they selected food.

[Miki]
"This is kind of like a flea market."

[Kiri]
"It'd be nice to be able to trade the things we
don't need."

[Miki]
"Not a bad idea."

Their pleasant chat faded into the distance with
them.

[Taichi]
"Huh? Where are the Flowers?"

Taichi's turn.

[Tomoki]
"You just missed them."

[Taichi]
"They beat me to it! I was the one who invited them!
Two flowers, slipped through my hands."

[Tomoki]
"They left some flowers."

[Taichi]
"What?! They gave flowers to the enemy?!"

[Tomoki]
"Who said I was your enemy?"
"Anyway, you're here. Take what you want."

I showed him the sorted boxes.

[Taichi]
"I'll stop by on the way home."

[Tomoki]
"There are boxes here for Touko and Youko, too."

[Taichi]
"I don't think Youko needs hers."

[Tomoki]
"Perhaps. But I still need to split it evenly."

[Taichi]
"No worries. Are you delivering to Rubber, too?"

[Tomoki]
"He doesn't show up, and I don't know where to find
him."

[Taichi]
"What about Mimi?"

[Tomoki]
"It'd be a huge help if you could take her share to
the rooftop for me."

[Taichi]
"No thanks."

[Tomoki]
"Why not?"

[Taichi]
"You should be the one to do it."

[Tomoki]
"..."

It was evening now.
I walked with a heavy cardboard box.

[Tomoki]
"My sister is as selfish as ever. Everyone else
comes to get theirs."

Sakuraba...will get his part sooner or later.
But, my sister will never do that.
I opened the metal gate and climbed up
to the rooftop for the first time in a while.
How long has it been since I stopped coming?
I could feel the warmth of the sun
through the concrete.
I really didn't want to see her face.
I put the food where she'll see it and left.
That useless antenna was such an eyesore.
She was sound asleep at the base of it.
I held back my emotions and walked slowly.
I placed the cardboard box near her.

[Tomoki]
"The food...needs to be shared fairly."

I tried to stay calm as I muttered under my breath.
And I left as quickly as I could.
The next few days were quiet.
I went to the cafeteria on Sunday morning.
The food I had collected over the course of the week
was gone.
Some had been stolen, and the rest had been cruelly
devoured.

[Tomoki]
"You've gotta be kidding me."

Everything I had gathered had vanished in a flash.
I thought it might have been wild dogs at first.
But it was just impossible.
There was only eight people left in the world.
It could only be one of us.

[Tomoki]
"But why...?"

That food was for everyone.
Why would anyone do such a thing?
My sister came to mind immediately.
Maybe my club took people away from the broadcast
club?

[Tomoki]
"Would she really stoop that low?"

Would she be able to do it if she wanted to?
I couldn't imagine her being able to scatter this
much food.
And...even if she was this aggressive,
I doubt she'd want to hurt herself in the process.

[Tomoki]
"But someone must have done it!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, Tomoki. Why the long face? Ugh, I'm so full.
Don't worry about my share today."

[Tomoki]
"You ate until you were full?"

[Taichi]
"I've been eating since morning."

[Tomoki]
"How many times did I tell you not
to steal food?! You betrayed me!"

I lead Taichi into the kitchen.

[Taichi]
"This is terrible."

[Tomoki]
"This isn't your doing?"

[Taichi]
"You think I'd do this?"

[Tomoki]
"You're full... The S Special... And you've stolen
food before... You're the most suspicious by far."

[Taichi]
"Whaaat?"
"I'm full, because Youko made me
such a big breakfast!"

[Tomoki]
"Liar! You're just making excuses!"

[Taichi]
"Hold on. I'll prove my innocence."

[Tomoki]
"Go ahead and prove it then."

[Taichi]
"Youko! Come here!"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"She's not coming."

[Taichi]
"Youko! Youko! Come to the cafeteria at once!"

There was no way she was gonna show.

[Tomoki]
"Horrible. I misjudged you, Taichi. I never thought
you'd do such a thing..."

[Taichi]
"Why are you so sure it was me? Rubber might have
done it..."

[Tomoki]
"Sakuraba only eats curry rolls."

[Taichi]
"What reason would I have to eat this much?!"

[Tomoki]
"You ate it, I know it! And you've been seduced
by my sister, too, you traitor!"

[Taichi]
"You're serious, huh. If so, it looks like I've
misjudged you as well."

[Tomoki]
"You're the same. You're just like my sister. I
believed in you, and you betray me."

[Taichi]
"Shut up, you sister-lover!"

Taichi tried to grab me.

[Tomoki]
"I'll show you a sister-lover! I'm so sick
of hearing that! You think you know everything!"

I shoved his arm away and pushed back.

[Miki]
"Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!"

[Taichi]
"I'm knocking some sense into this blockhead."

[Tomoki]
"You're not gonna get away with this!"

[Taichi]
"Your anger will be your undoing!"

Taichi's eyes sparkled mysteriously.
His eyes sometimes did that.
They coldly pierced through others.

[Tomoki]
"I won't back down from your threats! You betrayed
me! Is that what friendship means to you?!"

[Taichi]
"You've declared me guilty without even a shred of
evidence..."

[Miki]
"Calm down, you two. Don't fight over me."

Yamanobe tried her best to diffuse the situation,
but it only made me angrier.
I was just trying to make sure that the food
would be divided fairly.
And what did Taichi do...?

[Kiri]
"Shima, we've got trouble... There's no food
left..."

Kiri showed up. She seemed just as shocked as I was.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi ate it all!"

[Taichi]
"I did not!"

[Kiri]
"I knew it... You're disgusting, Kurosu."

[Miki]
"Oh come on, Kiri. Don't just assume he's guilty."

[Taichi]
"Yes! I've been falsely accused!"

[Tomoki]
"You're seriously still playing dumb!"

[Taichi]
"You're the one refusing to believe me!"

[Tomoki]
"You really think that pathetic excuse is gonna work
on me?!"

[Taichi]
"Then I get it's on then!"

[Tomoki]
"From stealing food to 'it's on.' You've got some
nerve!"

[Taichi]
"You still have no idea what you're talking about!"

[Tomoki]
"Fine then. Do your worst. I'll never forgive your
betrayal."

I followed Taichi to the rooftop.
I saw my sister's escape and smug point of
pride...the broken antenna.
Speaking of my sister...

[Misato]
"You two can't fight! You're suspended!
Both of you!"

She seemed nervous.
She didn't care about either of us.
She's just worried about her little sanctuary.
The Flowers seemed concerned as well.

[Kiri]
"I'll never forgive this..."

Seemed like Kiri was on my side.

[Miki]
"Shima, calm down! Kiri, you too!"

[Kiri]
"You're too naive on Kurosu, Miki."

Touko showed up, drawn by the commotion.

[Touko]
"What's this all about? Are you mental?"

Her cold gaze rested on me.
The girls watched on as our duel began.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi... I'm coming for you!"

[Taichi]
"Fine. But you'll find that you're no match
for my Karade!"

[Tomoki]
"Don't make me laugh!"

My body was filled with rage.
It's been one week since the phenomenon occurred.
I helped everyone in my own way.
There was no way I can just sit back
and stay calm after someone destroyed
my hard work.

[Tomoki]
"Come on!"

I hit Taichi with everything I could muster.
It sent him flying to the ground.
Was what I thought...
Taichi evaded my strike with the kind of movement
you'd expect from a master martial artist.

[Tomoki]
"Unnh...!"

His punch hit me in the stomach, and I crumbled to
my knees.

[Tomoki]
"Ngh...!"

I took another hit to the face.
My nose snapped, and a metallic taste
spread through my mouth.
I feared the next attack.
But Taichi held back for some reason.

[Taichi]
"Waaaaaaagh!"

[Tomoki]
"Huh..?"

[Taichi]
"Blood! Blood! Ohhh noooooo!"

He was afraid of the blood flowing out of my nose.

[Tomoki]
"Then it's my turn..."

I countered with a blow of my own.
And then I kept punching.
I continue punching him
but found that my breathing had intensified.

[Tomoki]
"You! You! You!"

[Taichi]
"What the hell is your problem?"

We grappled at each other, and our bodies fell into
a tangled mess.

[Miki]
"They're fighting like children..."

[Kiri]
"You both can do better than that!"

[Touko]
"How awkward..."

[Misato]
"Keep it up, and you're suspended!"

Easier for them to say from the sidelines.
Our stamina was fading fast.

[Tomoki]
"Huff, huff, huff..."

[Taichi]
"Huff, huff, huff..."

My heavy breathing gave me a second wind, and we
began to trade blows.

[Touko]
"This is ridiculous..."

[Miki]
"Let's go, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

We kept fighting even after they left.

[Sakuraba]
"What are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Can't you see for yourself?"

[Sakuraba]
"No. You playing something?"

[Both]
Tomoki: "We're fighting!"
Taichi: "We're fighting!"

We said it in unison.

[Sakuraba]
"Stop fighting. We promised to be friends, right?
What happened?"

[Tomoki]
"Taichi ate all of our food."

[Taichi]
"How many times do I have to tell you
it wasn't me!"

[Tomoki]
"Still?!"

[Taichi]
"How dare you?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Don't fight over food. There are no curry rolls
left, but I did find this."

Sakuraba produced a cardboard box full of food.

[Tomoki]
"You..."

[Sakuraba]
"I found it in the cafeteria. It's my favorite food."

[Tomoki]
"Is this it? What about the rest?"

[Sakuraba]
"I tossed it."

[Both]
"So it was you!"

Sakuraba fell to the power of our combined fists of
fury.
A refreshing breeze blew across the rooftop.
Exhausted, Taichi and I lied down.

[Taichi]
"This...feels good."

[Tomoki]
"It sure does."

I felt refreshed.
It was my first time being totally out-of-my-mind
stupid in ages.
Come to think of it, I've been thinking way too
seriously the week since it all went down.
I seriously and stubbornly tried to get on
everyone's good side.
I wanted...to be rewarded somehow.
At least with gratitude.

[Tomoki]
"Hahahah..."

[Taichi]
"Something is odd."

[Tomoki]
"I'm sorry I doubted you, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"..."
"Friendship is..."

[Tomoki]
"Not asking anything in return."

Ain't that the truth.

[Tomoki]
"You're really something, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"You're not so bad yourself..."

What I needed was just this silly friendship we had
all along.
Food, no worries. Just had to gather them again.
What was lost could be restocked again.
And what was broken could be repaired.
How did that never occur to me before?
I watched the sun set. Its lingering glow painted
the clouds.

[Taichi]
"The sunset."

[Tomoki]
"Indeed."

[Taichi]
"Wanna shout?"

[Tomoki]
"You know it."

[Tomoki/Taichi]
"YOU IDIOTTTTTTTT!!"

The sun and world disappeared with a shout.
