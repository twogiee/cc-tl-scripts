[Kiri]
"Are you okay?"

[Miki]
"Yeah... I'm fine..."

Miki wiped away the tears with Kiri's handkerchief.
They nestled together.
There was no room for me.
I turned on the flashlight and took the lead.
Why did Miki want to come here?
And why the three of us?
Why did she cry?
She must have her secrets, too.
Well, that was her business, I suppose.
That said, we were near the shrine, weren't we?
Maybe I should have a look.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, I need to check on something quick."

I handed the flashlight to her.

[Taichi]
"See you later."

[Kiri]
"Umm. Hey wait."

[Miki]
"Uh, that way looks dangerous..."

A little later...

[Taichi]
"I'm finally here."

I put emotion into every syllable.

[Taichi]
*yelp*

I felt my ankle twist and I started to fall.
Maybe it was better just to go with it and fall.
Passivity.

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

I looked at the ground carefully.
Footprints.
There was a line of footprints extended from the
front of the shrine.
It would take dozens of trips to do this.
I took a close look at the shoe prints.
Size 27 or so.
Same as mine.
The brand might've even been the same.

[Taichi]
"..."

They were the same shoes as mine.
They weren't Tomoki's shoes.
Nor were they Sakuraba's.
None of the girls wore a 27.
I knew their bodies well, I had no doubt.
That meant either I had been here and couldn't
remember. Or somebody else had, using my shoes.
But why would anyone come to this shrine?
I couldn't wrap my head around it, when suddenly-

[Taichi]
"...!"

I smelled blood.
A faint smell of blood.
Drawn by it, I pushed through the thicket.
Alarm bells started ringing in my head.
I grabbed a knife from the Taichi Bag.
A large knife.
Almost a short sword.
Of course, carrying it was illegal.
But the notion of crime was long gone.
Acceptable or not, I needed it for the sake of
self-defense.
I had a constant fear of being attacked.
I listened carefully.
I focused my attention.
I walked slowly.
Looking around left me feeling uneasy.
There.
I sensed something over there.
I carefully moved around and approached it.
A bow trap...
It was made with a small crossbow.
Going further in would have triggered it.
It was set to kill.
I could only imagine one person doing this.
I cut the wire and removed the arrow.
It had been very well-hidden.
And very well-placed.
It was located right before a step.
Carelessly taking that step would have spelled doom.
A malicious but reliable trap.
Shall we see what is further in, Youko?
I proceeded further and found a wire trap.
A snare. Tripping on it would cause a rock to fall
from above.
Destruction.
The alarm bells in my head went quiet.
Maybe that was all of the traps for now.
I still proceeded with extreme caution.
I pushed through the last of the bushes and there
she was. Youko. Dead.

[Taichi]
"..."

How could I possibly describe the feeling?
It wasn't shock.
It wasn't anger.
It wasn't grief or sorrow.
It was an indescribable rush.
My insides seemed to swirl.
Youko was dead.
Blood had flowed in streams from her chest.
The blood looked old.
It was hard, discolored, and dark.
I touched her. She was cold.
It had been days since her death.
She had gone stiff.
But she showed no signs of decay.
And this may sound weird, but...
Nah, not now.

[Taichi]
"So, you're dead, huh, Youko?"

I spoke to her beautiful corpse.
I had never thought that she would be one to die
young.
I fixed her hair.

[Taichi]
"You let it get messy."

She didn't answer.
I talked to the way one would talk to a small
animal.
As cruel as it may have been.
Perhaps a small bunny.
Though she was more of a wolf or lion...

[Taichi]
"What a shocker."

My vision clouded.

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

I tried touching the corner of my eye.
Tears.
A lot of 'em.
I didn't feel sadness.
But my face muscles tightened and the tears came
out.
They wouldn't stop.

[Taichi]
"Oh wow... Look at me go."

So strange.
Maybe my body was sad.
But my heart...
Yeah.
Half of me was dead.

[Kiri]
"You..."

Kiri!!

[Miki]
"..."

And Miki, too.
I considered hiding the knife, but what was the
point?
I had already been seen.
I'm sure they would misunderstand.

[Kiri]
"You...murderer...I knew it..."

She knew it.

[Kiri]
"You killed her, didn't you?"

[Taichi]
"No..."

[Kiri]
"Why are you holding that knife?"

[Taichi]
"Only because I was entering the thicket."
"See for yourself. It's an arrow wound."

[Kiri]
"I'm not going any closer."

They had followed me.
Kiri had been watching me closely.
She wasn't about to let up now.

[Kiri]
"We were just laughing...having fun... And then you
go off and do this like it was nothing."

She spat.

[Kiri]
"What have you done?"

[Miki]
"Taichi..."

Miki appeared to be in shock.
Her face seemed conflicted, confused.

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki."

[Miki]
"Okay..."

They turned to leave.
I was left behind.

[Taichi]
"But it wasn't me."

Not that it mattered.
Youko was dead.
It had shocked me more than I thought.
My mind went blank and I couldn't think clearly.
I lamented her loss.
