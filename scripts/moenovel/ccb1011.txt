And so, I went about club activities.
What should I do with this component?
How about there?
Or maybe over there?

[Taichi]
"..."

This seems like a good place.

[Misato]
"Do you know what you're doing?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, more or less."

Misato was supporting the ladder below me.

[Misato]
"It's good to have a boy to rely on!"

[Taichi]
"It must be."
"A boy like me to order around..."

...was more likely what she meant.
Didn't she have a little brother or something?

[Taichi]
"Hey, are you and Tomoki still fighting?"

Misato's face suddenly clouded over.

[Misato]
"Well, I mean..."
"It seems like a cold war between you two."

[Taichi]
"I wonder if Tomoki's fighting back?"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"He's not the type to get so angry."

Misato seemed shocked when I told her this.

[Misato]
"Yeah, probably not, huh."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"I hate this feeling. People are so hard to
understand sometimes."

I had no idea what she was talking about.
"She'll turn on you, you know."

[Taichi]
"So, was it a betrayal or something?"

Her brow furrowed at this.

[Misato]
"Is that what Tomoki told you?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Misato?"

[Misato]
"Mmhmm, mhmm..."

It sounded like she was about to cry.

[Taichi]
"Errr..."

[Misato]
"What can I say to him?!"

The ladder began to shake with her trembling.

[Taichi]
"Whoa-whoa-whoa?!"

[Misato]
"This is not going to hold!"

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna fall!"

And thus, another full day of club activities came
to an end.
