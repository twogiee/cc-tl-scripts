[Taichi]
"You think we can do it...?"
"Tell me we can..."

[Youko]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"Hahah, that's cool."
"Then, let's try to work it out."

[Youko]
"We have to make this work."

I nodded.
I just managed to stop my trembling.

[Youko]
"We have to."

[Taichi]
"Yes."
"We can't make any mistakes."

[Youko]
"Or we'll get killed."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Youko]
"We have to kill before we get killed."

And that day.
We were armed.
...
We adjusted our sleeping schedule and changed the
mansion overnight.
We set traps.
Calculated the patterns and routes of each room.
We prepared our means of communication.
We tended our weapons and went over our plans again.
Our plan was perfect.

[Youko]
"For you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"And for you, Youko."

We held hands.
And kissed.
Our battle for life was about to begin.

[Youko]
"You don't have to worry."
"I'll handle it all for you..."

I was the support role.
In fact, all the countless traps I set up was to
compensate for the power I wouldn't be able to
provide.
Then, the battle of life began.
...
She took the lead.
I followed.
She was strong.
She could do it for sure.
But, how about me?
Killing...
Would I be able to do it?
I cried.
I needed to break down.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to kill anyone.
Youko was exhausted so I laid her down on the bed at
the nurse's office.

[Youko]
"Hmmnn..."

Maybe I teased her a little too much...
She was unconscious, no way she would wake up.

[Taichi]
"..."

But no matter how much I shamed her in front of
people, my emotions wouldn't clear up.
How could it.
Understanding people...

[Taichi]
"Don't recall it."

About that time.
The sacred battle that took on that sacred place...
...
I looked up at the roof before exiting the school.
Mimi was about to jump down.

[Taichi]
"..."

I saw the moment when her soft body hit the hard
ground and shattered.
My emotions instantly flew to an uncontrollable area.
...

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

I felt nauseous.
I swallowed my gastric acid a few times.
It's just that, that red colored scenery was just so
dazzling.
It wasn't about physics.
But it also wasn't about a mental thing either.
I was in the middle of a scene of reality that had
the worth of dyeing your field of vision.
Of course, I hated red.
It put a great burden on my heart whenever I looked
at it.
It was like torture.
My nausea was derived from this burden, which was
like a defense mechanism to protect my
individuality.
The pure red color that corroded my consciousness
interposed with the noise.
And the unpleasant feeling acted as a filter.
But, my five senses were dull. Or rather, gone.
It felt like lucid dreaming. I was also aware of
my languidness, it was as if I was laying down.
So, I started a lecture.
1. About Mimi.
The bashful play I did to Youko was unfolded in
front of Mimi, but had she noticed it?
The question above didn't hold any meaning.
It was for spying.
A small body could be a weapon.
To not be found.
To close in on distance.
She did well.
Excellently.
She was as swift and light as a ninja.
And the knife in her hand...
Had they noticed it?
The question above didn't hold any meaning.
2. About Sakuraba.
Sakuraba didn't resist.
He may not have comprehended the situation.
Life. Taken.
Right before my eyes.
His throat was slashed while asleep.
Blood smeared on the sheets.
His eyes stared at us blankly.
He may not have comprehended the situation.
3. About Kiri and Miki.
A point to be aware of was that Kiri was armed. And
since they always work in pairs, there was a
possibility that Miki also was armed.
Originally, Kiri would be first. She had the
offensive ability.
But we had to be careful since we didn't know how
dangerous Miki could be.
The first set of the sequence. To research how much
threat Miki could be.
We practiced and it worked well.
The pair was always together.
They were siblings so it made sense.
Their relations were harmonious.
Therefore, Youko suggested that we should handle it
together.
First the older brother, then the younger.
There were no worries.
We practiced and it worked well.
4. About Touko.
She was dead.
She might have been on her way to the restroom.
She was also an accomplice.
Mistress to a man and preferred oppression.
Same offense.
I had no more memories.
When I realized...
She was dead.
5. About Tomoki.
He was dead.
The body was moved and hidden in the prefab area.
The water in the mop bucket on the roof was dark
red.
That's all.
Worthless idiot.
The idiot could only get amused.
Preferred madness.
Even though that idiot didn't have any idea about
madness.
Then I lost it.
Became radical.
And hurt them.
Cut everyone I touched.
They only had quantity.
So they just run around.
I didn't leave anyone behind...
I handled all of them!
Several younglings were turned into meat.
That's all.
6. About Youko.
She didn't resist.
Then there was the special one.
He was the one that needed to be handled
differently.
Threatened and brought along.
He witnessed the thing I had assembled and was
terribly surprised.
I called it the family tower.
I made it.
The material was the relatives.
I couldn't leave all the burdens to Youko.
I had to help. I had to do something.
We performed a prosecution.
We informed the offense and proclaimed the judgment.
His smile.
Voice.
Hahahah-
Heheheh-
I remembered it well.
His sadistic, intense laughter.
Now.
See?
Everything's okay.
Open your heart.
Trust us.
Open your heart.
Trust her.
Open your heart.
We'll help you.
I cut the chest open...
Ran the blade along the chest muscle.
Softly dissected the rib cage and...
Took the heart.
Could we listen to it?
He didn't resist.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

Something like this happened before...
...
...
...

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

The day had gone dark.
I regained my senses.
Was I playing dumb this whole time?
I assessed the state I was in.
Firstly, what day was it?
I knew it.
It was evening when I left the main gate.
Which meant a whole day had passed.
In that one day, I was...
Wow, such a great sunset.
In the clear atmosphere, I could see the light
and shade of crimson red.
I glanced down and my shirt was smeared pitch black.
The blood of four people.

[Taichi]
"Uhh... Uh, ugghhh..."

I opened my mouth like a beast, and from the bottom
of my lungs...
Let out a voiceless scream.
The "red" had spread everywhere.
Maybe it was Sunday.
I stood by myself on the rooftop.
Youko hardly resisted.
I stared at my hands.
Hands that were bright red.

[Taichi]
"..."

Youko wasn't the only one laying around.
All were there.
How did it end like this?
I remember that the antenna was broken and everyone
gathered around. Tomoki was the culprit and Kiri had
her crossbow with her and...
Youko killed Kiri.
Then she attacked everyone who tried to stop her.
Like a killing machine.
Which led me no choice but to kill Youko, and...
I told everyone that was left that it'd be all right
then... Who was it... Someone picked up a knife and
pointed it at me.
They implied that I was a monster.
But I wasn't a monster.
Then, I unintentionally killed them.
Unintentionally killed everyone.
I broke Miki before I killed her.
Broke in many ways. It was a bit troublesome.
And I felt like I killed another person or two.
Did I break them then kill them?
Or the other way around?
Which was worse?
I couldn't remember.
What happened yesterday?
I couldn't remember anymore.
Trivial, compared to today.
Oh yeah, I killed...everyone.
Was there anyone left to kill me?
No one?
I lied down.
The sky was so beautiful.
The sky was so filthy-looking.

[Taichi]
"Red..."

Even someone like me teared up.
...
