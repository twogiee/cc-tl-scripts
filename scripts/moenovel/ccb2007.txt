[Touko]
"Dang it!"

She shouted in my ear, and I came to my senses.

[Taichi]
"Y-yes?"

[Touko]
"You were zoned out, ignoring me. You hurt me."

[Taichi]
"Hey, look."
"Am I not even entitled to zone out?"

[Touko]
"I thought you were thinking of Misato."

[Taichi]
"I was thinking about a guy."

[Touko]
"?!"

She suddenly seemed shocked (visually).

[Touko]
"A guy... Yikes... I never...(blushing)."

[Taichi]
"Oh, jeez."

That was the worst.
And she wasn't all that mistaken.

[Taichi]
"Daydreaming girl...quit dreaming too much."

[Touko]
"If you three idiots were like that... It could be
nice, you never know."

[Taichi]
"Stop it!"

Disgusting.
For her to think of us having a love story...

[Taichi]
"..."

"Taichi, don't make fall for you, okay?"
"I kinda like that about you."
Whawhawhawha!

[Taichi]
"Why are you thinking about disgusting things?
They're just friends!"

[Touko]
"Come on, it's not disgusting. You three idiots look
like you would have a go."

[Taichi]
"Don't include me."

[Touko]
"Yikes. Is it because you're the ugly duckling?"

[Taichi]
"Shut up!"

It was a serious problem.
I wondered why this masochism kept on coming.
It was true though that it could be not about the
looks...
Even so, you couldn't change your self-awareness so
quickly.
Because...
It's because...

[Taichi]
"Anyway."
"This is what you get for thinking disgusting
things!"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

Strip!
I wondered if that word functioned as onomatopoeia.

[Touko]
"Wha...?!"

[Taichi]
"Take this!"

I grabbed the edge of her skirt and lifted it above
my head.
I humiliated her much more than she did to me!
Out in the public, too!
What now, Touko?!
What's next for Samurai Sister! (Like a movie
trailer).
In reality...
I actually prepared and expected to get punched.
But instead...

[Touko]
"..."

She gave me a reproachful look.

[Touko]
"Pervert."

Her face blushed.
She didn't even try to guard her panties from my
hand.
You could totally see them.

[Taichi]
"Why...aren't you...angry?"

[Touko]
"Well, no one can see it..."

[Taichi]
"Bu-"

My lips trembled.

[Taichi]
"But that's not the problem, right?!"

[Touko]
"Why are you the one getting angry?"

[Taichi]
"I guess because I was disappointed."
"Come on, show me a punch!"

[Touko]
"Can you just let me go? I can't walk like this..."
"It's...embarrassing."

*tap*

[Taichi]
"You tapped me."
"Is that it?"

She nodded at me.
Alas!
Nietzsche said...
That Touko was dead.
Just kidding.
A part of Touko was dead.
The Touko who was widely regarded as a
fast-punching, determined girl.
It was that particular personality of Touko that was
dead.
Touko became real, again.
But I really liked the Touko who was always so
angry.
Because that was the most stable part of her.
So if that was the case...

[Taichi]
"I see the mysterious secret."

[Touko]
"Just let my skirt go... It's drafty I can't relax!"

[Taichi]
"Then I'll make it more drafty! I'll take your
panties off so you can't put anything under there!"

[Touko]
"Stop! You can't just hold on to that forever!"

[Taichi]
"Not just that. We're about to fall all the way to
hell."

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"See you in court, Touko!"
"There!"

And then...
I let my forbidden hand go.

[Taichi]
"Oh Touko! C'est Bon! (It's great!)
C'est Bon! (It's great!)"

She knew French well, and I admired it.

[Touko]
"..."
"Ouuuuuuuu!"

She was saying "Youuuuu!"
I wondered if it was her lisp.
If you kissed her, you could hear it.
You sucked on her tongue a bit, and it got worse.
But on the other hand, her mouth was as hot as a
furnace.
Her tongue was as soft as cream that enraptured me.
The days we had together seemed to sprint by...
Then.

[Touko]
"Idiooooooooooot!"

*whaam!*

[Taichi]
"That's the punch I was expecting!"

I danced around while thinking about it.
About a man named Yutaka Shinkawa who no longer
existed.
