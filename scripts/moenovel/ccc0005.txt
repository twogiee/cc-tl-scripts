"But if it's lunch, you could have just left it on
the desk."

[Youko]
"It's because I couldn't go to the...power plant."

[Taichi]
"You couldn't go? To the power station?"

I didn't get it.

[Youko]
"..."

She stayed quiet.
Damn it.
As usual, she didn't mention any details.
She only spoke with the minimum amount of words
needed for me to understand.
I could interrogate her, but getting the accurate
answers to my questions would take too long 
so there was no use of trying.

[Taichi]
"So you checked it? It's so far away though."

[Youko]
"Because it was dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Ohh, right..."

Well, power plants were dangerous if something
happened to it.

[Taichi]
"So, you've come to report that?"

She nodded.

[Taichi]
"Right... Good job."

She nodded.
She looked a little happy.
I let go of her cheeks.
Her porcelain white forehead was slightly red and
swollen.
Nevertheless.
What did it meant that she couldn't go?
Did a landslide get in her way and stopped her from
physically reaching the power station?
The facility surely met the requirements to run but
the surrounding land wasn't that good.
But to assert that it was safe... Meant that it 
was confirmed.
Hmm...

[Taichi]
"So why couldn't you go?"

She had already disappeared.
Even though I just took my eyes off her for a
second.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."
