It was now lunchtime.

[Taichi]
"Phew! I swam so much that I'm all worn out!"

[Miki]
"Yeah, me too!"

[Kiri]
"Sorry to keep you waiting."

Kiri had returned.

[Kiri]
"We have gas, so we can make a small campfire."

[Miki]
"Is it all right to use the beach house like this?"

[Taichi]
"Considering the times we live in,
I'd say it's fine."

[Miki]
"Ahhh, I don't really wanna think about that..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi, please don't pick on my Miki."

[Taichi]
"Your Miki, huh?"

[Kiri]
"Yes. I won't give her away."

[Taichi]
"She's half-mine!"

[Miki]
"I'm being doled out like some conquered nation..."

[Kiri]
"I won't allow it."

[Taichi]
"Hand her over!"

[Miki]
"Waaahh, that hurts!"

[Kiri]
"Ah...!"

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, she's all mine!"

[Miki]
"No, this was Kiri's win, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"But why?! I'm the one who pulled you away!"

[Miki]
"When a child being torn between parents cries out
in pain...the one who lets go first is obviously the
one who really loves them."

[Taichi]
"Aaarrrggghhh!"

[Miki]
"So that means Kiri is the rightful winner."

[Kiri]
"Now that that's settled, why don't we eat?
The food's getting cold."

[Taichi]
"I mean, it's instant noodles, canned goods,
and rice cakes..."

[Kiri]
"Please don't complain. What we have is better than
nothing."

[Miki]
"Instant noodles are perfect for beach house living."

[Taichi]
"That's true."

[Miki]
"Ah, by the way Kiri, what happened there?"

[Kiri]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"Ummm, that's..."

Kiri gave an instinctive glance my way.

[Taichi]
"Don't wanna take the question? Or maybe you have
something you wanna confess to me?"

[Both]
"Nope!"

[Taichi]
"Ugh, and in harmony too..."
"Should I leave you two be?"

[Miki]
"Ah, sure."
"Meow."

She suddenly started pretending to be a cat.

[Kiri]
"Meoow."

[Miki]
"Graow-mraow-graow."

[Kiri]
"Meow meow."

[Miki]
"Mrow!"

[Kiri]
"Mraw-grao!"
"Meow, mraw-grao-meow."

[Miki]
"Meooow..."

[Kiri]
"Rrrmeow?"

[Miki]
"Mraow..."

[Taichi]
"C-cat talk?"

Miki and Kiri continued to meow to each other.

[Taichi]
"Haha, errr... Uh...creepy..."

After a bit of their cat-banter...

[Miki]
"Oh yeah, the day's already over, huh?"

They linked arms and nodded to one another.

[Kiri]
"Hey, don't say it...!"

[Miki]
"Ah, shame on me-ow!"

[Taichi]
"You understood all of that just now?!"

These two beautiful young girls had constructed
their own language?!

[Taichi]
"Hey, teach me too!"

[Miki]
"No can do."

[Taichi]
"Why not?"

[Kiri]
"Because Taichi, you're nothing like a cat."

[Taichi]
"I'm the spitting image of a cat!"

[Miki]
"Huh? How so?"

[Taichi]
"Check it out!"

I covered my eyes.
*blink*

[Taichi]
"Look, my eyes shine in the dark!"

The beach house we were in was dimly lit.

[Miki]
"Wow, that's so nostalgic! Look Kiri, it's just like
he said!"

[Kiri]
"Wow... They really are shining."

[Taichi]
"I'd say this is more than enough qualification."

[Miki]
"So mysterious..."

[Kiri]
"Are you wearing contacts?"

[Taichi]
"No way! These are my natural eyes. And I can turn
it off at will."

I closed my eyes.
*blink*

[Taichi]
"And back to normal mode."

[Miki]
"Whoa, so kewl!"

[Kiri]
"I guess that's...pretty kewl, huh?"

[Miki]
"So you can see perfectly in the dark, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yup, I've got night vision."

[Kiri]
"Just like a cat."

[Taichi]
"I mean, sometimes I exhibit cat-like abnormalities.
At least that's what the doctor said."
"If I hadn't been careful as an infant,
I could have lost my eyesight."

[Kiri]
"Is that so...?"

[Miki]
"Ah, I've gotta go to the toilet..."

Miki then suddenly took off.

[Taichi]
"Me too..."

I felt a sharp prodding.

[Taichi]
"Whuh?"

[Kiri]
"Don't you dare peek..."

[Taichi]
"Hmph."

...

[Taichi]
"Hey, at least Miki's looking better."

[Kiri]
"I guess she just needed a breather..."

[Taichi]
"It's not as if Miki doesn't have human emotions..."
"And she's not ignorant either. She's just like any
other healthy individual."
"Even though there's no one left, I truly believe
she can bear it."

[Kiri]
"That's all anyone can do..."

[Taichi]
"You don't feel lonely, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"I feel... I'm not sure..."
"Without others, malicious intent is all but gone,
and yet...and yet..."
"..."

[Taichi]
"I understand. Our hearts and minds are created by
the pressures of those around us. For everything to
end up like this... It's awful."
"That's our dilemma."
"Without our hearts and minds, we're nothing more
than beasts, but with them...we experience so much
strife."
"It's a delicate balance, the human spirit."

[Kiri]
"It'd be nice if we could live regular lives..."
"But...we just had to get trapped in this
mountainside... Like we're all criminals..."

[Taichi]
"Well, you're not wrong there."
"We started exhibiting traits harmful to others."

[Kiri]
"That's true..."

[Taichi]
"But you, Kiri, you're one of the good ones..."

[Kiri]
*gulp*
"Wh-what do you mean...?"

[Taichi]
"You look like your head will pop any moment, Kiri."

Kiri held her hands to her head.

[Kiri]
"Um... Is that so?"

[Taichi]
"May I touch it?"

[Kiri]
"Please don't make it anything dirty..."
"I'll know if you do."

Oh, she thought she'd know, did she?
I caressed her head gently.

[Taichi]
"Ah, it's not so stuffed up. Just kinda puffy."

[Kiri]
"I don't understand the difference..."

[Taichi]
"Well, in any event, keep at it!"

[Kiri]
"Um... Keep at what?"

[Taichi]
"The world is full of evil intentions, and you
should have some claim to it too, Kiri."
"But it's not a claim you need to take
from people at gunpoint."

[Kiri]
"Hm???"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, it looks like you're getting along nicely!"

[Taichi]
"We're the best of friends!"

I wrapped Kiri in a tight hug.

[Kiri]
"Oiee?!"

Did she just say "Oiee"?

[Miki]
"I'm so jealous!"

Miki wriggled about in her displeasure.

[Miki]
"And I don't know which one I'm more jealous of!"

She went on wriggling about.
But then she suddenly leapt at us.

[Taichi]
"Whah!"

[Kiri]
"Whah!"

[Miki]
"Graow-mraow-graow!"

Miki began circling the two of us.

[Taichi]
"Hey stop it, you're gonna get me all worked up
being so lovey-dovey...."

[Miki]
"Lovey-dovey!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey!"

[Miki]
"Licky-sticky!"

[Taichi]
"Knock it off!"

[Kiri]
"Stop it right now!"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, a little late for that..."

It slipped out!

[Kiri]
"Gwaahh?!"

[Miki]
"H-has our Taichi been transmogrified?!"

[Kiri]
"Oh noo!"

[Miki]
"Mrao nyoooohhhh!"

[Taichi]
"Y-you two are to blame! Take some responsibility!"

[Miki]
"That was so much fun!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, we should go again!"

[Miki]
"Okay!"

It seemed we were all back in high spirits once more.

[Taichi]
"Oh hey, remember the pictures you took today?
Will they take long to develop?"

[Miki]
"Do you want them soon?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, by tomorrow night if you can."

[Miki]
"That's pretty soon... Well, I can develop them
at school and give them to you there."

[Taichi]
"Thanks. See ya later!"

[Kiri]
"Bye-bye!"

[Miki]
"Bye-bye!"

Miki ran off towards the apartment buildings.

[Taichi]
"I'll walk you back too, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Thanks."

[Taichi]
"Mmm, I'm pretty hungry now..."

[Kiri]
"Do you have something to eat?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, for sure. I've still got a healthy-sized
lunch from Tomoki."

[Kiri]
"Um... Why don't you come by tonight?"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Kiri]
"To my place. I can make some dinner for you."

[Taichi]
"That's pretty generous of you..."

[Kiri]
"Um, I wanna talk to you about something..."

[Taichi]
"And the question you wanna ask must be...?"

For a moment, Kiri held her breath.

[Kiri]
"Yeah, that's right."
"I want to ask you about Yutaka."
"I want to clear the air... If we don't, then I
won't know...how to be around you..."

[Taichi]
"Is that right. Hmmm..."

Damn, Friday came too fast.

[Taichi]
"Would tomorrow work instead?"

[Kiri]
"Tomorrow...?"

[Taichi]
"Let's talk about everything. If you come at noon,
we'll have plenty of time."

Yes, everything.
Honestly and openly.

[Kiri]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"At school."

[Kiri]
"I understand, Taichi Kurosu."

So very proper. So very Kiri.
She stretched her back.

[Kiri]
"Thank you very much for everything today.
Excuse me."

She said her farewell as if she had just finished
sports club.

[Taichi]
"Yep, see ya."

We parted ways...
Saturday.
One more day.
Only one more day.
I peeked my head into the classroom,
and saw only Miki there.

[Taichi]
"Where's Kiri?"

[Miki]
"Ah, good morning. Kiri's not here yet."

[Taichi]
"Gotcha."
"Did you get the pictures developed?"

[Miki]
"I'll go do it after this."
"Reprints are 5,000 yen each."

[Taichi]
"What a rip-off!"

[Miki]
"Oh, why don't we all have lunch together?"

[Taichi]
"Sure."

And so I waited.
...
Lunch hour rolled around.

[Taichi]
"Wh-why are those two so late?!"

I was so hungry...
Maybe I should just eat by myself...
Today's lunch was rice balls.
And seasoned too. It looked so good.

[Kiri]
"Good morning, Taichi Kurosu."

[Taichi]
"You're late..."

[Kiri]
"Um... You were the one who said lunchtime, Taichi
Kurosu."

[Taichi]
"Oh, I did?"

That sounded familiar, at least...

[Kiri]
"I came to ask you a question."

[Taichi]
"All right, but let's eat first."
"Look, there's enough for two!"

[Kiri]
"I see... All right, let's eat..."

[Taichi]
"Time to dig in!"

*nom nom*

[Taichi]
"How's the Youko situation? She hasn't been
pestering you, right?"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"She has?"

[Kiri]
"Every time I leave my home, on the front door..."

[Taichi]
"On the front door...?"

[Kiri]
"It says 'Miss Piggy.'"

[Taichi]
"Is she five years old...?"
"Is that all?"

[Kiri]
"For now..."

[Taichi]
"Well, if nothing else has happened yet,
it's best to leave it at that."

[Kiri]
"Why is she so good at slinging stones...?"
"It's so strange."

[Taichi]
"She's good at most things."
"She's fundamentally different from most people."

[Kiri]
"Did she go through some special training
or something?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Every time we had a long break, she went
overseas and employed a local military instructor."

[Kiri]
"Military..."

She was speechless.

[Taichi]
"That's probably how she learned to use the sling.
Or maybe she learned it from a real shepherd."
"Does it still hurt?"

[Kiri]
"Not much..."

[Taichi]
"Splendid."
"I'm sure she does lots of other things too."
"Life is just personal training to her."
"I'm a competent martial artist, but nowhere near
her level."

[Kiri]
"You know martial arts?"

Now she was interested.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, Karade."

[Kiri]
"Never heard of it..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"Is it a dollar-store version of Karate?"

[Taichi]
"Grr..."

I suppressed my urge to shout her out of the school.
It was the first time I was silent when someone
dared compare my Karade to Karate.

[Taichi]
"Dear, sweet Kiri... If you were attacked by aliens
you know I'm the only one who can save you, right?"

[Kiri]
"Are you saying aliens exist?"

[Taichi]
"That's a trivial matter. I was merely offering an
example."
"She's probably really good with firearms, too."

Kiri blinked at me in surprise.
Maybe I jumped too quickly back to the Youko topic?

[Taichi]
"If it came to martial arts or grappling, she could
kill in an instant. She has many skills and she
recently bought a top-quality knife."

[Kiri]
"S-seriously? For her to kill like that..."

[Taichi]
"Weren't you gonna do the same to me
not too long ago?"

I gave her cheek a few pokes with my finger.

[Kiri]
*cough*
"I, I wasn't really gonna...!"

[Taichi]
"It's all right, it's all right. I'm generous, so I
can forgive you."
"I think it's only natural for you to hate me."

[Kiri]
"..."
"I don't understand you anymore... Honestly..."
"I know I can't help it that I was saved
and couldn't do anything about it."
"But...even setting that aside...for you to...
I don't know how to put it... It seems like
you're desperately trying your best..."

[Taichi]
"You're very perceptive Kiri, really..."
"You should get a job in HR in the future."

I gave her shoulders a firm pat.

[Kiri]
"Before, it felt like you were just having fun,
and it wasn't a pleasant feeling..."
"There's something different about you now, Taichi."

Oh boy, the conversation was getting serious.

[Taichi]
"Well, I just can't afford to lose anymore..."

I scratched my head.

[Taichi]
"When everything would just reset, I thought only
about the pleasures of life."

A faint frown came to Kiri's face upon hearing the
word "reset."

[Taichi]
"Chasing all those pleasures got old."
"Even to someone with a tiny, pathetic heart like me,
it gets old."
"I hate the way I am."

[Kiri]
"You hate yourself...?"

[Taichi]
"For all the reasons you told me before, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"But that..."

[Taichi]
"However, I did find one solution. A last resort, if
you will."
"So that's why...for everyone...I will..."

I looked to the sky.
It was so empty and crystal-blue.

[Kiri]
"Um, about Yutaka..."

Yutaka, huh.
He was a question that was hard to answer.

[Taichi]
"So, let's keep having our friendly fights."

I interrupted and thrust my right hand towards her.

[Kiri]
"A-all right."

Kiri promptly extended her right hand as well.
We shook hands.
A handshake certifying peace.

[Taichi]
"Well then, how about a party to celebrate this
cease-fire?"

[Miki]
"Lunch is ready!"
"Huuhh?"

[Taichi]
"Hey Miki."

[Miki]
"You're already eating...and it looks so good..."

[Taichi]
"I did invite you."

[Miki]
"Liar... And to think, I went and developed the
pictures for you and everything..."

[Taichi]
"Good work!"

[Miki]
"Whoa-whoa-whoa!"

Miki roared in protest to the massive treachery
I had committed against her.

[Miki]
"So what am I supposed to do with all this food I
brought?"

Miki dumped the contents of her tote bag onto
the desk.
It was a mountain of food that quickly spilled to
the floor.

[Taichi]
"It's mostly sweets, that's hardly a meal."

Sheesh, this girl...

[Miki]
"Teehee!"

[Kiri]
"No canned food?"

[Miki]
"It's all gone."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm. Having only snacks for lunch...
That's rough."

[Miki]
"Is it?"

[Taichi]
"It's not good for you, either."

[Miki]
"But I love snacks!"

[Kiri]
"I'm already full..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, me too, sorry."

[Miki]
"Whaaah...?"
"Fine, I'll eat it all by myself!"

She was quite offended.

[Kiri]
"You'll get fat."

[Miki]
"..."
"I don't care, I love snacks!"

She launched right into eating her chips.
It was an ugly side of this beautiful creature
that I hadn't seen before.

[Taichi]
"You're just eating your feelings."

[Miki]
"But, but..."

[Kiri]
"Don't cry..."

[Taichi]
"Here, have a rice ball."

They were made for someone of my proportions,
so I figured one ball would be plenty for Miki.
It meant there wasn't enough for me...
But no biggie.

[Miki]
"Ooh, home cooked food!"

She clung fast to my hand with the rice ball in it.

[Taichi]
"Oh, do you want it? Hmmm?"

I held it up above her head.

[Miki]
"Ah, gimme!"

[Taichi]
"Here, here!"

I moved it to my right.

[Miki]
"Aahh, oooohh..."

[Taichi]
"Over here, over here!"

Then to my left.

[Miki]
"C'mon..."

[Kiri]
"You're always teasing her."

[Taichi]
"Here..."

[Miki]
"Ahhh, yummy yummy!"

She began nibbling at it furiously.
The mountain of snacks remained.

[Taichi]
"She's got bad eating habits for a girl.
Is she always like this?"

[Kiri]
"It's always canned food and breads and such."

[Taichi]
"Eat some vegetables."

[Kiri]
"There aren't any."

[Taichi]
"Here, some tomatoes. There's two just for you."

[Miki]
"Ooooh, tomatoes!"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm? Do you want these too?"

[Miki]
"Gimme!"

[Taichi]
"Here, here!"

I moved them to my right.

[Miki]
"Aahh, oooohh..."

[Taichi]
"Over here, over here!"

Then to my left.

[Miki]
"C'mon..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi... You're such a bully."

[Taichi]
"Phew!"

[Kiri]
"Mmm..."

[Miki]
"So tangy!"

[Kiri]
"But it's so good..."

[Miki]
"I could cry!"

[Kiri]
"It's good to be alive..."

[Miki]
"Meow!"

I watched Miki and Kiri eat the tomatoes with
puckered lips out of the corner of my eye while I
drank from my canteen.

[Taichi]
"..."

I realized we were being watched.
This girl was something else...
Her jealousy was transparent...
Was she insinuating something by making her presence
known to me like this?

[Miki]
"What's the matter?"

[Taichi]
"Oh nothing...we're just being monitored
by an Ichihara-style operative."

[Miki]
"Ichihara?"

[Taichi]
"E. Ichihara was the top female ninja of her clan,
and the proprietor of this spying technique...
But don't worry about it."

[Miki]
"Hn?"

[Kiri]
"Gwaaaah?!"

Kiri must have seen her.

[Kiri]
"Taichi, T-T-Taichi... Oh, oh no..."

[Taichi]
"No worries, I'm right here with you."

[Kiri]
"O-okay..."

[Miki]
"Eh? Eh?"

[Kiri]
"Th-there..."

Kiri pointed in Youko's direction, and Miki looked
on questioningly.
But Youko was no longer there.

[Miki]
"What? There's nothing there. What's up?"

[Kiri]
"Th-that was definitely her... Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"A Shimura Phenomenon. Miki can't physically observe
Youko's presence."

Taichi Keyword:
"Shimura Phenomenon"
A type of observational problem that
occurs under specific stable conditions.

[Kiri]
"Ugh..."

Kiri was deathly unnerved.

[Taichi]
"It'll be all right. Youko's just making idle
threats."
"Just ignore it, ignore it."

[Kiri]
"Okay... I'll try my hardest. I'm pretty good at
ignoring."

[Miki]
"Well then, time for dessert!"

We finally got back to eating.

[Kiri]
"Um...Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Kiri]
"She's crying..."

[Taichi]
"Never mind her!"

[Kiri]
"I can't help it..."

[Taichi]
"She's putting on an act. Don't be fooled. Like a
robot, there's no human heart in Michael's- My
bad...Youko's chest."

[Youko]
"..."

Hmmm, her gaze was making me uneasy.
Perhaps it was time to have the talk with Kiri.
Once Miki's absence gave me an opening,
I could offer Kiri the suggestion.

[Taichi]
"All right, should we go?"

[Kiri]
"Oh, okay, please let me use the toilet really
quickly."

[Taichi]
"Sure, I'll go use that other one too."
"Phew."

It was the critical moment.
If I didn't gain her trust...

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"You..."
"You've been pretty cooperative so far."

[Youko]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"You've come to stop me from going to that toilet?"

[Youko]
"Yes..."

She answered frankly.

[Taichi]
"Are you upset that I've reconciled with Kiri?"

[Youko]
"I think it's pointless."
"But if that's what you want... There's nothing I
can do."

Was that so?
And was that her true intent?

[Youko]
"Now that I've got you here, give me five minutes."

[Taichi]
"I'm not going."
"We've worked so hard to maintain stability up to
this point, I don't want it to all be for nothing."
"And... I'm sorry for the hand grenade."

[Youko]
"..."

She grinned widely.
For as fundamental a creature she could be, Youko
Hasekura would sometimes show that smile.
Even this most extreme of human beings can bring
that much happiness into the world.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, I just figured it'd be trouble
if I didn't say something, sorry."

[Youko]
"In other words, I shouldn't get in the way?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, sorry."

[Youko]
"I won't. I'll give you the cooperation you need."

[Taichi]
"I see..."

[Youko]
"Memories... If only we could get a hold of them,
Taichi..."

And just like that, she disappeared.
All signs of her ever being there were gone as well.
As if she had never even existed.
She walked using an almost supernatural technique
to hide her presence.
Like she wasn't even human anymore...
I headed back to the first-year classroom.
I took a deep breath.
Well then, time to pull off the big con!
And...

[Kiri]
"I've been waiting."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

For a moment, we just stood there.
We stood at a distance.
I'd let it be for the moment.
Kiri would likely reject any advances.

[Kiri]
"I want to say something first."
"I thought you were some filthy murderer."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"You killed Yutaka."

We silently met each other's gaze.

[Kiri]
"The day Yutaka died, I saw you two on the rooftop."
"And I saw you and Yutaka talking."

[Taichi]
"..."

My senses froze in an instant.
Time to sink into the sea of turbulent emotions.

[Kiri]
"And then, Yutaka was dead."
"I didn't realize at first. But then later... On
that rooftop, you..."

Oh, that time...

[Kiri]
"That's why I didn't want to have anything to do
with you."
"But then you came to me."

There was a look of hesitation in her eyes.

[Kiri]
"So then I thought about it. You...were... I figured
you were just devouring people's hearts."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."
"Destroying people's hearts to sate my appetite...
Is that what you mean?"

[Kiri]
"Yes..."

Her eyes trembled with uncertainty.

[Kiri]
"And...the way you would look at me..."
"When you looked at me, it sent shivers down my
spine."

[Taichi]
"Yeah...I could see that..."

She was sharp.
It must be hard for her to live in the world of
people like that.
Her heart would instantly be stained.
It was that sharpness that caused her
to be brought to Gunjo.

[Kiri]
"But, I don't know who you are now. Your true
colors... No, whatever this is that you are..."
"If... If this is who you are now..."

She hung an arm out the window.

[Kiri]
"Then this is all I can do..."

She pulled her arm back inside.
And with it, a cloth bundle in hand.
And as she unraveled the bundle...

[Kiri]
"I'm sorry, you can resent me for this if you want."
"I just want to get to the truth."

[Taichi]
"..."

Youko, please don't make a move.
I wished beyond wishing.

[Taichi]
"Considering the circumstances, you're more than
free to pull the trigger. You have at least that
much right, Kiri."

It was time to give in.
Because even now, I was still trying to devour Kiri.
It was time to pay the price.
All right Kiri, I'm putting my life on the line.
Give me what you got.

[Taichi]
"Yutaka's death was suicide."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"But it was because of me."

A seemingly endless silence followed.
But before long...

[Kiri]
"Please continue..."

We passed the first stage.

[Taichi]
"It'll be a long talk..."

[Kiri]
"So talk, Taichi."
"Please talk, and set me free."

Was it hostility, or amnesty?
Which would I be greeted with?
In Kiri's heart, there was only room for me to meet
one or the other.
I swallowed hard and continued talking.

[Taichi]
"Hasekura had a home, a while back."
"A big house with a Western design. Ten times the
size of Kirihara's house."
"A multi-millionaire family's type of home."
"I lost my mom when I was young and they took me
in."
"I worked there while I stayed, for the husband and
wife who were distant relatives to my mom."
"It was a home with an old tradition."
"The subordinate kids were just that, subordinates."
"I was a kid, so my duty was to be playmates with
the other kids."
"Youko was their youngest daughter."
