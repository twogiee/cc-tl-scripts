"Hey, little Miss Wishy Washy."

[Touko]
"Wha...?"

[Taichi]
"Here, it's yours."

I gave her my sandwich from earlier that morning.
Touko just kept staring at me.

[Touko]
"What is this?"

[Taichi]
"A sweet bun."

[Touko]
"No it's not! It's a sandwich!"

[Taichi]
"Impressive skills of deduction."
"Here."

*shove*

[Touko]
"Cut it out."

She pushed it away.
The sandwich fell.
I picked it up.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating well?"

[Touko]
"Like I need to tell you."

She spun around.

[Taichi]
"It's tough having to look out for yourself, right?"

[Touko]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"You want others to worry about you."
"You want to feel fulfilled."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I'm worried about you a little."

She glared at me.

[Touko]
"You got some nerve."
"If you're worried, why, then, why?!"

She lost her temper.

[Taichi]
"...Kirihara."

[Touko]
"WHAT?!"

[Taichi]
"You look pale. Is it that time of the month?"

*WHAM*

[Touko]
"You're an idiot!"

She cursed at me, and ran.

[Taichi]
"Ah... My sandwich..."

*sigh*

[Taichi]
"I had that coming..."

I picked up the sandwich and bit into it. What else
was I supposed to do?
