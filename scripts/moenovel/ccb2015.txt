[Taichi]
"Wow. This place is dead."

There weren't many security guards around.
Or any at all, really.

[Touko]
"It's more than dead. There is no one here."

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

Right. That was just what I thought.
Anyway, the cafeteria was deserted.
Which meant that I had to compete with no one for
the good stuff...or not.
There wasn't even any sign of life in the kitchen.

[Touko]
"So, what are we doing here?"

[Taichi]
"I was just getting tired of croquette rolls."

I went to where Sakuraba had been.
He was still there.

[Taichi]
"..."

Sakuraba was done for eating too much.

[Sakuraba]
"Aw..."

[Taichi]
"Have you been eating all this time?"

Moron.
There were still lots of leftover curry rolls.
I grabbed a case.
I opened it and started eating.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

It wasn't spoiled.

[Taichi]
"So since these have been here since Monday, does
that mean they were delivered Sunday evening?"

Four days ago, humanity had still existed.
But why wasn't the food spoiled?
I didn't have any idea.

[Taichi]
"Here, it's still good to eat."

[Touko]
"Oh, you were testing it for us?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, what'd you think I was doing?"

[Touko]
"Oh, um, nothing..."

I bet she thought I was taking it all for myself.

[Taichi]
"Despite all I did to preserve your perfect
bottom..."

[Touko]
"What bottom are you talking about?"

I tapped Touko's forehead.

[Taichi]
"Bottom! Your perfect bottom!"

[Touko]
"O-owwww!"

[Taichi]
"Eat this."

[Touko]
"I sometimes don't get you..."

She muttered in confusion, but she took a bite.

[Touko]
"Spicy..."

[Taichi]
"Yep, they're the spicy type."

[Touko]
"I need a drink."

I covered my mouth in surprise.
Her tongue was so weak.
I had my water bottle with me.

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Touko]
"Oh."

She took it instantly, but stared at the rim.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Touko]
"There's not much left."

[Taichi]
"Hmm? You can drink it. I don't need it. Besides, we
still got plenty."

[Touko]
"You drank from this, right?"

[Taichi]
"Um, yeah?"

[Touko]
"Yeah, figures."

What was her deal?
It couldn't be...
The indirect kiss!
My heart started to pound.
It was my first time watching it happen.

[Touko]
"It's like an indirect kiss, isn't it?"

[Taichi]
"..."
"..."

[Touko]
"Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Hhhhnnnnnggg!!"

[Touko]
"Wh-what was that?!"

I poked her breast.

[Touko]
"Waah!"

[Taichi]
"Let's do a replay!"

I went down.

[Touko]
"There's no switch there!"

[Taichi]
"You're right..."

[Touko]
"What do you mean by replay, anyway?"

[Taichi]
"I want you to say those words again."

I got up.

[Taichi]
"Now, time for a replay."

[Touko]
"No way."

Rejected.
What a largesse.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, we need it."

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Wait here."

I went to the classroom.
Then came back.

[Taichi]
"The video camera."

It still had some charge left.
I set it up.
Time to roll.

[Taichi]
"Okay then, let's have that line again, go!"

[Touko]
"Just what do you want?!"

[Taichi]
"Seriously?"

[Touko]
"Don't act dumbfounded, you jerk!"
"It just looks like I said something funny."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, but, what's wrong with recording it?"

[Touko]
"Why do you need to?!"

[Taichi]
"To preserve memories?"

I cocked my head a little.

[Touko]
"Why are you answering me with a question?! And
would you want to preserve it?!"
"What? Did I say something crazy? Was it so stupid
you want to keep it on repeat? Was it really that
funny?"
"I...I was just caring but all you do is laugh at
me!"

She was on fire now.

[Taichi]
"Hey, calm down a bit..."

[Touko]
"~~II"

Whoa.
Oh well.

[Taichi]
"I just wanted to keep a record of our time
together!"

Touko's mouth stopped moving.

[Touko]
"Really...?"

[Taichi]
"I want to be able to relive these happy moments
over and over..."
"Hahah...I really messed it up, didn't I?"

I scratched my head.

[Taichi]
"It's true, you know, because I like you so much
Touko... I just want to keep these beautiful moments
forever."

[Touko]
"Taichi...I like you too!"

She flew over...
And wrapped her arms around me.

[Taichi]
"Touko! I don't necessarily dislike you!"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Gotcha, Touko!"

[Touko]
"Wha...Taichi?"

The fire was out.
"Nnnm!?"
It was Touko, moaning.
The video camera was on playback.
And at top volume.

[Touko]
"Huh... Was that my voice?"

"Mmm..."
"Oh, sorry..."
Squuooosh!?
I stopped thinking.

[Touko]
"H-hey, wait!"

She let go of me.

[Touko]
"Sakuraba?!"

He was sitting behind the camera, watching the
playback intently.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

He didn't answer when we called to him.
He just watched carefully.
Touko stood behind him peeking at the monitor,
looking ready to cry.
"You don't mind, do you Touko?"
It was me, asking the sleeping girl.
"Taichi...I love you..."
"Yep."

[Touko]
"Wh-wh-wha-what?!"

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

[Touko]
"B-but this?!"

She freaked out.

[Taichi]
"Ahahaha..."
"Yeah, I just taped that... Ahahaha!"

[Touko]
"..."

Touko's mood instantly changed.
In the monitor, Touko was unconscious.
And what happened next?
She watched.
"Whoa!"
It was my voice from the video.
Touko's ragged, deep breath filled the air.
"Mmhmm!"
"Whoops!"
"Mamma Mia!"
"Hooray! Hooray!"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

I confronted both of them.
I went limp.
The atmosphere darkened.
Touko grinned wickedly.
Was she turning savage?!
Perhaps...murderous?!
Her aura started expanding throughout 
the cafeteria.

[Touko]
"...iii..."

She murmured.
Had she lost it?
I tried to catch what she was saying.

[Touko]
"--ray, hooray, hooray, hooray."

She repeated my cry with a faint smile.
Oh no!

[Sakuraba]
"I have one question, though, seriously."

Sakuraba raised a hand.
Silence, as they say, was golden.

[Sakuraba]
"What you did in that video, could we call that-"

Sakuraba collapsed, his question unfinished.
He didn't get back up.
It was as if someone had switched him off.
Touko's hand hovered over the space where
he'd been.
But she didn't touch him.
Her hand just hovered there.

[Taichi]
"How did you?!"

[Touko]
"Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray..."

[Taichi]
"Oh no!"

*clink*
Harakirimaru was summoned before I knew it!
"When Touko's anger gauge was at max,
the bewitched blade Harakirimaru could leap time
and space to travel 4.5 light years in 0.05 seconds!"

[Taichi]
"Who are you?!"

Could she be the one who destroyed humanity?

[Touko]
"Hooray, hooray."

[Taichi]
"H-have mercy!"

I knelt with my head on the ground as I yielded just
like how the heroines did in old karate comics.
However...

[Taichi]
"Whence came this tempest, when skies were 
so clear?"

"Calls upon the storms when drawn, that's the
bewitched Harakiri Blade."

[Taichi]
"Just tell me who you are!"

Was I hallucinating?!

[Touko]
"Taichi Kurosu..."

[Taichi]
"I mean, you burned all my porno mags!
I've got to get my release somehow, don't I?"

[Touko]
"I'll make you two."

She decided to split me into two?
But I was only one!

[Taichi]
"If it's come to this, I'll spill it all!
I'll unleash my self-defense force!"

My nation might be hung up on the idea, but I
could never be satisfied just threatening ships
invading my waters.
I picked up the bag I'd brought with the camera, and
reached for my precious dagger...
But I couldn't find it.
I left it at home?!
So instead, I pulled out my TV remote and pointed
it at Touko.

[Taichi]
"If you move, I'll hit you with very weak infrared
rays!"

Which was totally pointless!

[Touko]
"..."

My enemy prepared her attack.

[Taichi]
"Eeep!"

I threw away the remote and covered my head.
But the blow never came.
I opened my eyes.
Touko had lowered her sword.
The video camera slowly fell in two pieces.
It had been bisected.

[Taichi]
"Waaaaah! My high-tech gadgetry!"

[Touko]
"The evil has been vanquished..."

[Taichi]
"Not that!"

She pointed her blade at my throat.

[Touko]
"It's better than dying, yes?"

[Taichi]
"Just as you say..."
