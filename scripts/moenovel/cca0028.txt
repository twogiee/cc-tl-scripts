Swimming at the beach, huh?
No offense to Miki, but I'll look back fondly on
today.
Memories enrich your soul.
Even I say the darndest of things, sometimes. For
example:

[Taichi]
"I know it's not really your thing, but why don't
you try coming to club tomorrow?"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

With a puzzled and confused expression,
she lifted her head up.
Her faded expression became infused with a scarlet
red, conveying a somewhat dejected impression.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

That night I was busy writing.
I wasn't getting anywhere with any of it.
Everything I wrote came off as so cliched.
But I had to keep at it.

[Taichi]
"It doesn't have that zing."

Of course.
What if I got Misato to have a read through it?
I wasn't going to waste any time.
I left straight away.
I reached her house.
I knocked on the door but no one answered.

[Taichi]
"Misato!"

Still, no one answered.

[Taichi]
"Your Taichi is here!!"

Silence.
Maybe she was out.

[Taichi]
"..."

She couldn't possibly still be at school could she?

[Taichi]
"Ohh, she's here!"

[Misato]
"Ah, Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"You're overexerting yourself!"

[Misato]
"S-sorry."

[Taichi]
"Whoa..."

It seemed like she was setting up an antenna, as
always.

[Taichi]
"Surely you can't do anything when it's this
dark outside?"

[Misato]
"It was bothering me... Is that wrong of me?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."
"If you have the spare time to do things like that,
why don't you take a look at my script?"

[Misato]
"Oh, did you already finish it?"

[Taichi]
"It's still in progress, but I wanted your opinion."

[Misato]
"Oh, but I can't read anything because it's
too dark."

[Taichi]
"Maybe."
"How about you call it a day now and go home?"

[Misato]
"Uhh... But I only have to do a little more."

[Taichi]
"Mimi..."

[Misato]
"Come on!"

[Taichi]
"You won't gain anything from rushing to finish it."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"There's no rush. Right?"
"There's plenty of time to finish it."
"Besides, the sooner you finish it, the sooner all
this will end."
"Would you be able to deal with that, Misato?"

[Misato]
"Er..."

She looked like she was about to cry.
I felt my spine go numb.
Then I realized I had blurted out too much.

[Misato]
"Maybe I'm running away."

[Taichi]
"Maybe."

[Misato]
"Does it look like that?"

[Taichi]
"It looks like that."
"You're running away by forcing yourself to work."

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"You're giving yourself more work to pre-occupy
yourself."

[Misato]
"Is it that obvious?"

[Taichi]
"I think that's pretty normal."

[Misato]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"What you're doing isn't that unusual."
"Everyone needs to take their mind off things once
in a while. We all need a way to escape."
"But for those who need to desperately escape
like you...it's hard."
"It'll take a toll on you."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Your adaptability score's 30 and then some."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Habitual self-mutilation?"

[Misato]
"..."

Silent affirmation.
I kept talking.

[Taichi]
"Working on your own is all well and good... Unless
you're doing it because you have nowhere else to
turn. Then it's dangerous."
"And if you're on a rooftop when the final straw
drops..."
"Are you following me?"

[Misato]
"Yeah... I am."

She said, dejectedly.

[Taichi]
"You're making me really worried."

She took her glasses off.
Then she patted her teary eyes with the back of her
fingers.

[Misato]
"I've been insecure enough to even make you
worry, Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"Haha... That's not the point I was trying to make."

[Misato]
"Ahahah."
"I didn't think I'd be told that by you of all
people."

I wiped her tears.

[Misato]
"Thanks."

[Taichi]
"Don't mention it."

[Misato]
"It's just that... I feel like we're all falling
apart. And everyone's going to vanish."

[Taichi]
"I haven't vanished, right?"

[Misato]
"Well, that's because you have...impure motives."

She saw through me.

[Taichi]
"Well..."

[Misato]
"But I might have become a little stubborn."

[Taichi]
"And to be clear, it doesn't seem like you're
really alone."

[Misato]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

I showed her the package I picked up under the
water tower.

[Misato]
"A gift?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."
"They're just curry rolls, though."

[Misato]
"Oh..."

She put her hands up to her mouth.

[Taichi]
"He's been keeping a low profile recently. Seems
like he's a little nervous."
"That idiot can't stand watching his friends getting
into trouble."
"But he doesn't let that stop him from bringing
these beaten up curry rolls."

[Misato]
"But you seem happy, Pekke."

[Taichi]
"Do you want some?"

She nodded ever so slightly.
We both ate the curry rolls together.
