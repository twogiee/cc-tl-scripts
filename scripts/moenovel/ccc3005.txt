It was evening, and I was writing in my journal.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

There was a sound outside.
I put out the candle.
And I went to the window.
I looked outside.
Someone was walking past the front of the house.
Kiri...
She was holding something.
I couldn't decide what to write in my journal.
I needed something to write about.
I went downstairs.
I "saw" her back in the distance.
I chased her.
At the outskirts of town, she set her burden down.
I kept quiet to avoid notice and crept closer.
It was a crossbow...
And clearly no toy.
It was the strongest weapon you could get in this
country.
The rate of fire was slow, but...
It was an exceedingly powerful weapon. And almost
silent as well.
Kiri pulled the trigger.
She put a bolt into a dead tree.
I only heard the sound of the wind.
Kiri took out another arrow.
She cocked and loaded the crossbow.
She was clumsy at it...
But, I understood.
She was training.
For a battle...
But, with whom?
I wondered who it could be...
The muscles on my back bunched.

[Taichi]
"...!"

[Youko]
"Sh."

As I was about to fly into action, someone held my
shoulder at just the perfect time.
And just like that...
My knees went weak.

[Taichi]
"Yo...u..."

[Youko]
"Quiet."

I took a deep breath and regained my composure.
I spoke quietly.

[Taichi]
"What are you doing here?"

[Youko]
"Same as you."

She noticed Kiri's behavior as well.

[Youko]
"Apparently she does this every day."

[Taichi]
"Where did she get that thing...?"

[Youko]
"From a collector."

[Taichi]
"Ah, yeah, I can see that."

If you had money, it wouldn't be that hard to buy.
Kiri went on with her training for a while.

[Youko]
"...Should I 'handle' it?"

She said, abruptly.
The silence was broken only by the sound of Kiri's
crossbow.
It was a chilling noise.
Almost as if the sound itself carried a dark
message.
"Taichi...do you want me to 'handle' it?"
"I can 'handle' it for you"

[Taichi]
"Why...?"

[Youko]
"If you want me to."

[Taichi]
"I don't."

[Youko]
"But..."

I glared at her.

[Taichi]
"If you're going to listen to me, then do nothing."

[Youko]
"...Ok."

Her shoulders seemed to slump.

[Taichi]
"I mean...you're human, right?
Youko...you're the same, a human."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"At the very least, if you're with me, you should be
halfway human."

[Youko]
"I..."
"I don't think you're human, Taichi."
"You're who you are. That's enough for me. And I'm
who I am. Together we're one."
"50-50."

[Taichi]
"It's like being engaged."

She smiled.

[Youko]
"Right, engaged."

Her rare smiles turned her face angelic, like a
little girl's.
Why...
Before my heart could overflow with sorrow, Kiri
moved.
She collected her spent bolts.
Then fired them again.
After three rounds, Kiri's training was finished.

[Youko]
"At her level, I think you're safe at all
but the closest range."

[Taichi]
"I don't want things to get that far, though."

I suddenly remembered the shrine.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Youko...do you know about the shrine?"

[Youko]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"This world..."

[Youko]
"Not enough intel."

Her words were sharp.

[Youko]
"There's no sense in moving too quickly."

[Taichi]
"But..."

[Youko]
"Even if the world is repeating, I don't think it
needs discussion."

[Taichi]
"..."

I kept silent.
If she said so, it must be true.
Youko Hasekura was always accurate.
Kiri had left.
There was no reason to chase her anymore.
I went into the open and checked the tree she'd used
as target practice.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"It's fine."
"It's fine..."
