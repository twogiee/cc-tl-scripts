We were on the roof.
We were both surprised to what we saw.

[Taichi]
"Is that...?"

[Touko]
"It's finished..."

The antenna.
The wiring.
There was even a broadcasting seat and tent for
live shows.

[Taichi]
"Misato did this alone?"

But she herself wasn't there.

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"While you were off wallowing in debauchery,
Misato was engaged in pure, wholesome
club activity, Touko!"

[Touko]
"Wh-why am I the villain here?!"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, this is a real shocker."

[Touko]
"I wonder if Misato is here?"

[Taichi]
"I can't see her anywhere."

Maybe she took Saturdays off?
But tomorrow was the planned Gunjo Community FM's
first broadcast.
Then.
In the distance, Touko started waving her hand.

[Taichi]
"Whaaat?"

I went closer.

[Touko]
"Look at this."

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

[Misato]
*snore*

She was asleep.

[Taichi]
"She must have been working all by herself..."

She looked so worn-out.
Her glasses were askew.
Her uniform was frayed as well.

[Taichi]
"..."

I went closer and did a sniff check.

[Taichi]
"She smells a bit sweaty, but sweet."

[Touko]
"Cut that out!"

*thunk*
There was a meaty sound.

[Taichi]
"Ow."

I thought I had a cerebral concussion.

[Touko]
"You can't just sniff girls' different odor out of
your interest."

Just hearing the words "girl's different odor" was
too much.

[Taichi]
"Alright, I got a question."

I raised my hand.

[Touko]
"Yes, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"You've never farted in my presence. Where do
you go to fart? And how much effort do you put
into avoiding it?"

[Touko]
"What does fart mean?"

She answered.

[Taichi]
"You've really toughened up."

[Touko]
"Don't be stupid."

Oh, Touko's gotten better at warding off my
harassment.
It was very impressive.

[Taichi]
"Heheh."

[Touko]
"Heheh."

We shared a belly laugh, like competitors filled
with mutual respect.

[Misato]
"Hmmnum..."

[Taichi]
"Oh, she's up!"

Misato sat up and stared directly at us.

[Taichi]
"Mornin', Misato! It's me, Taichi!"

[Misato]
"Huh? Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"Your one and only Taichi!"

Touko glared at me from the side,
but I paid her no mind.

[Taichi]
"If you tell me to suck you, I'll suck you. Just
give me the order!"

[Touko]
"Taichi!!"

[Taichi]
"Whooooa!"

Her Iron Claw to the back of my head
was excruciating.
But I withstood it!

[Misato]
"Um... What are you doing here?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, I just came to gaze on your lovely sleeping
face."

[Touko]
"You remember this."

Touko whispered in the background.

[Taichi]
"Kid, I kid! We came to see how you're doing."

[Misato]
"How I'm doing..."

[Taichi]
"It looks like things are pretty much ready."

[Misato]
"Y-yes."

[Touko]
"Um... Misato, did you do all this by yourself?"

[Misato]
"Well, yes... I mean..."

Misato swallowed down the rest of her sentence.
Her face filled with confusion.
And I understood what she wanted to say.

[Misato]
"I mean, it was my job to do."

[Taichi]
"Your job. Meaning, it's also my job."

I took her hand.
I kissed the back of it.

[Misato]
"Um..."

[Touko]
"..."

Huh?

[Taichi]
"Hey now, no need for Harakirimaru!"

Was that a storm rising?!

[Misato]
"Agh, what's happening?"

[Taichi]
"It's the work of the bewitched blade! After
drinking the blood of innocents for centuries, its
malice overflowed!"

[Touko]
"Abtol, Damral, Omnis, Nomnis..."

She was casting some kind of evil spell!

[Taichi]
"Halt! Halt!"

[Touko]
"You are to end with me!"

[Taichi]
"Just stop the suicide pact!"
"Settle down, will you? We're all friends here
after all..."

[Touko]
"You're right..."

It looked like she understood.

[Touko]
"Such good friends that you seduce another woman
right in front of me..."

[Taichi]
"Waaaah!"

[Touko]
"It's fine. Relax."

She grinned at me.

[Touko]
"This sword's edge is so sublime that it will only
cut your lust."

[Taichi]
"That's like something from those erotic historical
novels that use phrases like Whore of Babylon of
Mother Harlot!"

[Touko]
"Adulterer...philanderer...breedstud...
satyr...pervert...libertine...lech..."

[Taichi]
"Aaagh!"

She was accusing me of every sexual aberration
there was!

[Misato]
"Glasses, glasses..."

While I was contending with my imminent death,
Misato was behind me having a minor glasses crisis.
Ohhh, I wanted to film the whole thing!
But I was going to die!
My desire to film was fighting with my survival
instinct.
But I chose my camera!
My desire to film won.
But what good would it do?

[Taichi]
"I can't let myself die!"

I grabbed Touko's shoulders.
It was my last resort. Or rather, my lust resort.

[Taichi]
"Touko! I-I-I-I-I-I LOVE YOU!"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

*smooooch*
It was a kiss deeper than the Mariana trench.

[Misato]
"Oh, where are my glasses?"

I needed to get this on film!
But I had to face the battle in front of me.

[Touko]
"Mmm..."

Touko stirred gently.

[Misato]
"Oh man, oh man! I can't see anything!"

The Kiss and The Glasses.

[Touko]
"..."

Touko gradually melted into me.

[Misato]
"Eeep, I can't find them!"

The Kiss and The Glasses, continued.

[Touko]
"..."

[Misato]
"I found...no, these are Groucho glasses!"

The Kiss and The Glasses, still continued.

[Touko]
"..."

[Misato]
"Huh? What's this? No, these are night-vision
goggles..."

The Kiss and The Glasses, still going and going.

[Touko]
"Nnm..."

She slumped.
Then she fell, but I catched her.
Touko stayed limp in my arms.

[Misato]
"Ah! Here they are!"
"Now, to put them on."

*tiiing!*
Mimimi was back!

[Misato]
"What's wrong with Touko?"

[Taichi]
"I think she's got a cold."

[Misato]
"Her face is so red. And she's all sweaty."
"Oh no! Her body is all twitchy!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed, that's axi *ahem* an axion response."

[Misato]
"What is an axion response?"
"Is it a serious illness?"

[Taichi]
"No, no. It's nothing too bad."
"It really would be wonderful if they found dark
matter."

[Misato]
"...?"
"Why don't you have Youko take a look at her?"

[Taichi]
"Good idea. I'll take her now."

I lifted Touko on my back.

[Touko]
"Nmm... Taichi..."

The feel of her hot breath on my ear was thrilling.
No good! I was a safe aristocrat!
I turned around before going downstairs.
Misato stood there alone, unmoving.

[Taichi]
"Uh, uhm..."

[Misato]
"Y-yes?"

[Taichi]
"Is it okay if I join the club tomorrow?"

Her eyes widened.

[Taichi]
"I'll bring this one too."

I gestured at Touko with my chin.

[Misato]
"Oh... Certainly, go right ahead."

[Taichi]
"Okay, see you tomorrow!"

I went through the door.

[Misato]
"Um... Wait."

She stopped me.

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

It was like she came to her senses, and her face
went serious.

[Misato]
"G-go ahead..."
"Go ahead!"

She tried again.
In a loud, clear voice.
I answered.

[Taichi]
"Aye aye!"
