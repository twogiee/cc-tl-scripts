All right, stay loyal to the original work.
If I remembered right...
Miki was cleaning as I walked down the hallway.
My fingers came close to touching Miki's butt,
but I was only able to graze it.
She used to be so slow and I used to be able to
touch it as much as I wanted.
That was a major problem, principal!
But the improvement of my pupil was truly pleasant.
She may soon surpass me, her teacher.
So butt, huh.
But I couldn't figure out the details from this journal.
But there must have been some good times
with some sexual pranks.

[Taichi]
"Hiyaa."

Half-assed yell.
Reached my hand out at the same time.

[Miki]
"Hn?!"

Miki's eyes glimmered.
*grab*
Her arms tangled with mine.

[Miki]
"That is a sacred area. A sacred area I say..."

Her force went against mine.

[Taichi]
"My fingers only have to graze that butt,
please understand."

[Miki]
"Miki doesn't understand such nonsense!"

[Taichi]
"Calm your horses. I can seize it just by
grazing it."

[Miki]
"Still talking nonsense..."

*grrrr*

[Taichi]
"This is a major problem, principal!"

There was no end so I stopped my plans.

[Miki]
"Principal???"

[Taichi]
"Okay, fine. I'll stop."

She untangled her hands.

[Miki]
"Deranged, as usual, I see."

She was still a little vigilant.
She had grown up so much.

[Taichi]
"You've improved."

[Miki]
"No, not at all."

[Taichi]
"That butt that I touched so easily before has
turned into something inaccessible."

[Miki]
"Your words are too much."

[Taichi]
"But the improvement of my pupil is truly pleasant.
You may soon surpass me, your teacher."

Just like reading the diary.

[Miki]
"You've been saying some strange things today."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it. Just spewing out something
I've already expected to happen."

[Miki]
"Riiight."

She was speechless.
But she recovered quick and giggled.

[Miki]
"You really are same as ever."
"Even at times like this."

[Taichi]
"Well, you know."
"There are no dead bodies, just vanished."
"Pretty hard to grasp it."

[Miki]
"That's true."

[Taichi]
"No cats or dogs anywhere, not even the cicadas are
crying."
"Isn't it bad if the human body doesn't have any
germs in it?"

[Miki]
"I think germs on our bodies are fine?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you're right."

[Miki]
"Well, we might be in a really vague situation."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

[Miki]
"Hmm."

Miki was thinking, putting her hands together under
her chin like she was praying.
It was cute.

[Taichi]
"Nice gesture."

[Miki]
"Thanks. But...it's like we're dreaming."

[Taichi]
"Dreaming, eh."

That'd be depressing.

[Miki]
"That would be depressing."

Oh wow, similar minds.

[Taichi]
"Living in a world that has no sense of reality is
indeed like dreaming."
"But my thoughts are..."
" F.S. Phenomenon!"

[Miki]
"Flying... S-sh... Sher..."
"Sherbet?"

[Taichi]
"No."

[Miki]
"Flying... Sh... Shir."
"Shirt."

[Taichi]
"Flying shirt. No, still wrong."

[Miki]
"Flying... S-she... Shero..."
"Sherlockian."

[Taichi]
"Holmes, huh. The Japanese wrestling style
he possesses is a great form of martial arts
that even I recognize."

[Miki]
"So that existed."

[Taichi]
"It established Karade and Twin-Walls."

[Miki]
"I've never heard of either one of those."

[Taichi]
"Of course, it's meta arts."

[Miki]
"???"

[Taichi]
"They can only defeat people that satisfy specific
conditions."

[Miki]
"What a trash martial arts."

[Taichi]
"Games reach a certain meta if you probe into it
deeply enough!"

I got overexcited.

[Miki]
"Is that how it is..."

[Taichi]
"Very strong against particular opponents."

Also, many life forms non-existent in Earth.

[Taichi]
"Miki's Karade is getting on par too."

[Miki]
"Is Karade the nonsense martial arts you've been
getting me into all this time?!"

[Taichi]
"It's not nonsense!"

[Miki]
"I'm shocked."

[Taichi]
"Huh."

[Miki]
"Flying Shy."

The conversation suddenly backtracked.

[Taichi]
"Flying while being shy. Sounds like a funny scene."

[Miki]
"So what is the FS phenomenon?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I meant SF phenomenon. My mistake."

[Miki]
"..."

She gave an expression like she was outwitted.

[Taichi]
"It's called Somewhat Fictitious phenomenon and..."

[Miki]
"Ah, that's enough. I got it."

[Taichi]
"Oh, okay...?"

[Miki]
"In short, you're just saying IDK."

[Taichi]
"Science is powerless."
"And now it's time for my autograph."
"Lovely prince autograph collection. How much has
Miki collected?"

[Miki]
"Ah, yes. It's been a while getting an autograph."

[Taichi]
"We did just have summer break."

I received her student handbook.

[Taichi]
"..."

The handbook was full of my doodles.
I found an empty page and filled in my autograph.

[Taichi]
"There's a prize when you collect 20 of them."

[Miki]
"Probably a sexual harassment..."

[Taichi]
"Hm, did you say something?"

[Miki]
"No."

[Taichi]
"All right, I think I fulfilled my quota."
