Three of us had our hands stacked one on top
the other.
One was mine.
One was Tomoki's.
One was Sakuraba's.
But we weren't really that close.
Sakuraba just happened to be here.
And Tomoki was just a guy with no wits.
But for me, this was the first time I had male
friends.
I had thought that me getting along with other
humans was just a pipe dream.
But, I had been wrong.
Even though we were different, we were a good match.
Three guys together.
Three perverts...
When we were hanging out waiting for club to start
Sakuraba unconsciously said:
"Back in the day, girls' gym shorts were so hot."
And thus our friendship began to blossom.
Even though we hadn't been part of the generation
when school girls wore those super short bloomers.
I guess that just made it all the more interesting.
Gym shorts today were so boring...
Anyway, we made a promise:

[All 3]
"Even though our birthdays are different, just as we
will graduate school on the same day, shall we
graduate from our virginity together!"

We promised each other to stay a virgin till 
we graduated.
A level playing field.
To be honest... I had already done it...
But my soul was still a virgin...
Whatever.
Later I discovered Sakuraba was impotent and Tomoki
was in love with his sister.
Everyone had their own problems.
But, it didn't matter.
We just wanted to make a promise.
We wanted to pretend to be friends.
With our hands overlapping, we were determined to
stick it out together.
That was how we always acted together.
