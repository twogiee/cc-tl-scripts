When I woke up, Miki was in my arms.
Oh yeah, we fell asleep together.

[Miki]
"Yawn..."

We looked at each other.

[Miki]
"Kyaaaa?!"

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Miki]
"Wha? What? What happened?"

She looked disturbed.

[Miki]
"Why are you touching my boob! Get away from me, 
you perv!"

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Miki]
"Oh, yeah...right, right."

She stuck her tongue out.

[Taichi]
"You..."

[Miki]
"Hah, I mean, I thought it was your usual sexual
harassment."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

[Miki]
"Ah, I guess I grew up a little more again."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you're now an awesome young adult."

[Miki]
"Chomp."

She bit my nose.

[Taichi]
"It hurts!"

[Miki]
"I bet!"

She jumped on to me.

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

Then we really started holding each other,
and kissing.

[Miki]
"Non-stop kissing!"

[Taichi]
"Miikiiii!"

[Miki]
"Kiss!"

[Taichi]
"Miikiiii!"

[Miki]
"Kiiiiiss!"

...

[Taichi]
"Wait, we don't have much time."

[Miki]
"Ah...."
"Well, if that's so, I'll kiss you more!"

So girls loved kissing, huh.

[Miki]
"Ahh..."

My alarm clock was set to 10 AM on Sunday.
So I kissed her for the next hour.

[Miki]
"Tadah!"

Miki appeared wearing her uniform stylishly.

[Miki]
"Clean and refreshed."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Miki]
"Taichi too. Clean and refreshed!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

We went to bath together.
It was the secret water source I had saved, but if
it was the last day, it didn't matter.

[Miki]
"What are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Miki]
"Ah, it's a cold bottle!"
"Wait, how..."

[Taichi]
"When we got in the bath, I turned the little fridge
to quick freeze."

[Miki]
"It's the soda bottle with a bead inside."

[Taichi]
"80 yen at Tazaki Mart."

[Miki]
"Beautiful..."

[Taichi]
"When you look at the world through the glass bead
it shimmers so beautifully."

[Miki]
"It makes everything seem like summer."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

We drank the soda together.

[Miki]
"It looks beautiful, and the soda's good. I guess we
should go then."

[Taichi]
"I have to go to club too."

[Miki]
"Are you really going to the club?"

[Taichi]
"I'm ready to go."
"I think we can reach something even with that
broken antenna."

[Miki]
"Um..."
"Can't we live together, with our current selves?"

Her eyes seemed to implore me.
Earnestly.

[Taichi]
"I'm glad for your feelings, but..."

[Miki]
"I see..."

[Taichi]
"I want to forget it all. The aftertaste's not
good."

[Miki]
"I've been watching you every week..."
"All of those Taichis... They're not all the same
person."

[Taichi]
"I guess so."

[Miki]
"The both of us living now and talking, only exist
right now."

[Taichi]
"But Miki...you forgot something."
"My logic is very thin and often breaks."

[Miki]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"You'll eventually be in danger when you're always
with me."
"And because you're so cute, I might try to
overpower you."

I pat her head.

[Miki]
"It has to change, then..."

[Taichi]
"You're right."
"But if you to get spoiled, you can rely on Taichi
in that week."

[Miki]
"..."

She didn't answer.

[Taichi]
"Alright, let's go."
