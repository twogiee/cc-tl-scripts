At this point... I just had to do it.
Alone...so that Miki wouldn't notice.
Get rid of Taichi Kurosu...
So unlucky. Nothing good has happened, since the
morning.
I was in a hurry because I overslept, then I stubbed
my little toe on the bed frame.

[Kiri]
"...Arg!"

I cried from the pain.
I had snacks for breakfast, but I opened it in an
awkward way, making everything inside the bag
scatter about.
I slipped on the stairs and also tripped on the
street.
Things I've done a million times before,
I just couldn't do today.
People have disappeared from this world, so the evil
towards me should have also disappeared...
Slight misfortune. A turn of bad luck.
Unexpected mischief.
Now that people were gone, the world turned against
me instead.
That's how it felt.
When things weren't going my way,
absolutely nothing went my way.
I came across the last person I wanted to see in the
world first thing in the morning.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Morning! Good morning! Repeat after me!"

He's so annoying...

[Kiri]
"Hey..."

Guess I had to acknowledge him.

[Taichi]
"All right, let's get going."

He approached casually and tried to put his arms
around my shoulders.

[Kiri]
"Please don't touch me..."

[Taichi]
"Ehhh..."

I couldn't let my guard down around him.

[Taichi]
"You want to go find Mickey with me?"

[Kiri]
"Mickey? Do you mean Miki?"

[Taichi]
"There can only be one Mickey. Let's hold hands,
skip, and sing the march while we search."

[Kiri]
"Are you talking about..."

[Taichi]
"STOP! Now we're pushing into copyright territory!
Let's not go any further."

[Kiri]
"Then don't say it in the first place."

[Taichi]
"It's human nature to test the limits."

[Kiri]
"You always have to have the last word."

It was always like this. I could never keep up with
him.

[Taichi]
"Hey, what's wrong? You were friendly to me
up until today. What happened?!"

[Kiri]
"Stop making things up."

[Taichi]
"Relax, Justice Girl."

[Kiri]
"...Huh?"

[Taichi]
"You're just going to get tired trying to right all
of the wrongs in the world."

In the end, he always says something pointless and
confuse us.

[Kiri]
"Yeah... Whatever. I'll look for Miki on my own."

[Taichi]
"No, I'll go with you."

[Kiri]
"Don't follow me."

[Taichi]
"Fine. I'll do what I was going to do to you to
Miki!"

He said the most awful things!
Was he joking? Was he serious?
I had no idea what went on in his head.
I was worried about Miki, so I hurried to the
classroom.
But nobody was there.

[Kiri]
"Miki..."

It's fine, he was always like that. He was always
messing around, making jokes, and teasing women...
That's how he got close... Made you feel at ease...
And then cornered you...
Unable to stop this uneasy feeling,
I went to the window.
Nothing good happened since this morning. I hope
nothing else goes wrong.
The world changed. I didn't know what was going to
happen to us.
It'll all be okay. Miki and I... We were fine.
We won't...we won't change.
Kurosu was always the same. He always teased Miki.
Today won't be any different.
As much as I tried to calm myself,
this foreboding persisted.
Seriously, nothing was going my way. I should've
come to school earlier. If I didn't run into him
there...
I wouldn't feel so uneasy!
Unable to shake this feeling, I went to the
hallway.
Miki wasn't there.
Neither was he.
I checked the second-year's classroom.

[Taichi]
"I'd love to see you in this cute uniform!"

A shameless voice came from the classroom.
Wh-what did he just say?!
I peeked in the classroom quietly...
He was getting creepily close with Kirihara.
I couldn't hear them.
But I could probably guess what he was saying.

[(Taichi)]
"Why don't you wear the uniform?
I'll get you naked and change you."

[(Touko)]
"Stop... Stop, Taichi."

[(Taichi)]
"Hurry up and wear this school uniform."

[(Touko)]
"Why? It's not even this school's uniform!"

[(Taichi)]
"Quiet. How about a leotard or nurse uniform? Even
the school swimsuit would be good. Heheh."

[(Touko)]
"Noooo..."

A dry slap echoed out.
Kirihara had slapped him!
That perverted loser was sent flying
and rolled across the floor.
...He deserved it.
I felt that the pervert would be back soon.
I hid myself in the corridor's shadows.

[Taichi]
"Because I love you."

How flippant. So awful...
That awful man left.
I entered the classroom.

[Touko]
"Oh."

[Kiri]
"Uhm, are you okay?"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Kiri]
"I heard you guys from the hallway."

[Touko]
"It's nothing. I'm fine."

Kirihara faced down and blushed slightly.
I knew it, she was violated.
The enemy of women.

[Kiri]
"Where did Kurosu go?"

[Touko]
"I don't know... That loser."

[Kiri]
"I see..."

[Touko]
"He said something about the rooftop and 
club activities."

[Kiri]
"Thank you."

I thanked Kirihara and went back to the hallway.
I wasn't sure where to go. To the rooftop?
Or should I search for Miki?
I wanted to meet with Miki soon. But I didn't know
where she was.
I had a bad feeling.
I couldn't bring myself to go to the rooftop alone.
It reminded me of that day... Of Yutaka.
But that guy was up on the rooftop...
I had to go.
I opened the heavy metal door.
The sunlight was so strong.
Even though it was autumn, the awful summer
lingered.
It should be the start of a new semester, but this
horrible summer camp continued.
I hated it. Nothing was going my way today.
I shook off that sinking feeling
and searched for his shadow.
I soon found it.
There were two people near the antenna.
That's...
Misato was cornered against the antenna
and Taichi was coming at her from below?!
The wind blew.
Their conversation was carried off in the wind.

[Taichi]
"Panties..."
"Gimme...!!"

He was deceiving her with playful expressions.
That was his evil little trap.
He was setting her up to fall!
The trapped Misato staggered down
from the base of the antenna.
Oh no! Be careful! Stop!
I watched, holding my breath.
But nothing happened.
The two of them continued talking.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I couldn't watch any longer.
I let out a terrible shriek inside of me and left
the rooftop.
I couldn't be in a place like that. I didn't want to
be around that guy.
I should run. I should run as soon as possible!

[Miki]
"Kiri, there's no running in the halls."

[Kiri]
"Miki!"

Miki stood unworried in the hallway.

[Kiri]
"Who cares, Miki?! Hurry...run!"

[Miki]
"Chill out Kiri."

She poked me in the forehead.

[Miki]
"You should know better than trying to sweet talk a
lady while heavily breathing."

She posed with her index finger up.

[Kiri]
"Miki, don't make fun of me..."

[Miki]
"Well, that's no fun at all."

[Kiri]
"But... But... Kurosu..."

[Miki]
"Just calm down."

She held me gently.

[Miki]
"Okay...?"

Miki's scent was gentle and sweet.
It was soothing.

[Miki]
"Now tell me what happened."

I revealed everything to Miki.

[Miki]
"Mhm... Mhm... I see... That must've been hard."

She chimed in while listening to me sincerely.

[Miki]
"Don't worry Kiri. It's always like this.
That's just the way he is."

[Kiri]
"I don't know about that."

[Miki]
"Well I do."

Miki spoke to me kindly to calm me down.
That I knew.

[Miki]
"Taichi right now isn't a problem. I've seen far
worse before."

[Kiri]
"But, what if..."

[Miki]
"Don't worry. I will be on your side."

[Kiri]
"Miki..."

That made me happy.
In such a cruel world, only Miki was kind to me.
She's always been there for me.
Even in a world with no people,
she was by my side.

[Kiri]
"Miki...you're so strong."

[Miki]
"Heheh, I have a secret weapon against him.
I'll use that to get vengeance."

She struck a funny pose.
Was that martial arts?

[Kiri]
"That's not what I mean."

[Miki]
"What?"

[Kiri]
"The people are all gone. There's no one at home or
in town... I'm so scared and lonely..."

[Miki]
"Yeah..."

[Kiri]
"You don't cry or get upset... You're so mature."

[Miki]
"I was scared at first too and I cried a lot as
well."

[Kiri]
"Really? You seem so composed..."

[Miki]
"It's fine Kiri. You will get used to it gradually..."

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Miki]
"I think it'll return to normal soon.
Just as usual... Okay?"
"That's why you have to have hope!"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

Genuine, happy times without malice, passed.
However, that was suddenly broken.

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Miki]
"Oh, Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"What's going on? Girl's talk? Let me in on it."

[Miki]
"Sure, if you want to."

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're wide open!"

Taichi groped Miki's butt.

[Kiri]
"Miki!"

[Miki]
"Huh... What?"

[Kiri]
"Hands off you perv! Run for it Miki!"

[Taichi]
"Hang on, hang on. It was an inevitable accident."

[Kiri]
"How so?!"

[Taichi]
"I thought she would dodge it, but she didn't.
It's Miki's fault, not me."

[Kiri]
"That's such a lame excuse..."

[Miki]
"I let my guard down."

[Taichi]
"You've still got a lot of work to do..."

[Miki]
"Never expected you would do it in front of Kiri!"

[Taichi]
"No problemo! I've already discussed 
this with Kiri."

[Miki]
"So, that's not an inevitable accident, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, maybe you're right."

He was just clouding the truth again...
Please don't be so naive Miki.

[Miki]
"You can't do that Taichi."

She noticed!

[Miki]
"If you keep this up, it'll disrupt the ratings."

[Taichi]
"Not the ratings! Our overseas stock will drop!"

Without my worries being noticed, they were enjoying
their conversation.
My heart...grew cold.
I faded out and my existence started to disappear...

[Kiri]
"Let's go Miki."

[Miki]
"Oh, um."

[Taichi]
"I like your cold stare. Gets me fired up.
Especially coming from you, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"...Creep."

[Taichi]
"I love it when you call me that! Say it again."

[Kiri]
"No way."

[Taichi]
"Please?"

[Kiri]
"Cut it out."

[Miki]
"Taichi, Kiri really doesn't like that."

[Taichi]
"But I like how she doesn't like it."

[Miki]
"Show some respect, okay?"

[Kiri]
"..."

I couldn't handle it.
I couldn't watch Miki enjoying this.
I left the two and ran off.

[Miki]
"Kiri, wait."

I could hear Miki behind me.

[Kiri]
"..."

The world really was cruel. It gives you a glimpse
of hope and then snatches happiness away.
The world has changed. There's an immeasurable
amount of cruelty.
All that was left is important kindness and
unforgivable cruelty. The most important thing and
the most detestable thing.
The door opened, and Miki entered.

[Miki]
"Kiri... What's wrong?"

[Kiri]
"..."

I couldn't put it into words. I was so annoyed.
How could I tell her?

[Miki]
"Taichi was also surprised."
"He really does care about people."

No, that wasn't it.

[Miki]
"Kiri, Taichi is not scary."

No, he's tricking you.

[Miki]
"He acts weird sometimes, but I've got 
my eye on him."
"So everything is fine."

It's because Miki doesn't know his true nature...
Would she understand if I told her?
No. That'd only hurt her.

[Miki]
"For me, if the two of you got along..."

[Kiri]
"Impossible."

[Miki]
"Yeah... At least stop fighting."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Miki]
"Fine."

[Kiri]
"Miki, where are you going."

[Miki]
"I'm going to apologize to Taichi for you."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Miki]
"Would you like to come with me?"

[Kiri]
"..."

I couldn't stop her... I couldn't say anything.

[Kiri]
"Urgh..."

What should I do?
What should I have done?
What can I do to protect Miki?
When I noticed, I was at the rooftop.
I cried for a while and moped around the school.
Next thing I knew, I was here.
Gazing at the empty rooftop.
Misato wasn't there fixing the antenna either.
Maybe they all went home...
Or taking a break from the heat in their rooms?
I fearfully approached the antenna.
I didn't sense anyone.
From there, I stared at the fence on the corner
of the rooftop.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka..."

Yutaka died here.
No. He didn't just die. He was murdered.
He killed Yutaka, hurt Kirihara and set up Misato in
a trap.
And now Miki... She was his next target.
Miki was mistaken. Normally, she would've picked up
the warning signs.
But...the world has changed. We were the 
only ones left.
The teachers, security, the townspeople, police...
All gone.
Kurosu was just doing whatever he wanted.
He had complete freedom, there was no reason he
would behave himself.
If the monster inside him awakens...
No one can stop it.
He'd betray Miki, toy with her, then break her.
I had to protect her.
From Yutaka to Miki...he tainted everyone
important to me.
That was...unforgivable.
I quietly made up my mind.
At this point... I just had to do it.
Alone...so that Miki wouldn't notice.
Get rid of Taichi Kurosu...
I thought all night of how to get rid of 
Taichi Kurosu.
Miki still didn't know the real Taichi. She thought
he's just some horndog. So...
I couldn't do it in front of Miki. I had to do it
quietly, if possible make it look like an accident.
I didn't want her to be suspicious of me
or lose her trust.
CASE 1
I snuck into an empty classroom.
An inconspicuous closed-down classroom.
I could drop something on his head
from this window.
But what can I drop on him?
I first thought of something from the classroom.
Books, a chair, a desk, a clock, the blackboard
eraser...
Even if it killed him, it wouldn't look like an
accident.
We lived in a world where people disappeared
unnaturally, but we were still living normally.
If such unnatural things were scattered around a
dead body...
A mysterious power sent things flying out of a
classroom onto Taichi Kurosu's head!
Nobody would think that...
I would think he was murdered.
So that won't work.
Next, I thought of...ice. Dry ice.
I recalled it being featured in a whodunit.
A quiz or comic or cartoon, I couldn't remember
which.
The weapon disappeared so they couldn't find the
perpetrator.
It was difficult to get my hands on ice or dry ice
in a world without electricity.
All the ice I had at home had melted.
Having no choice, I walked around the school.
I searched for something that I could use.
I couldn't find anything usable.
Maintenance and cleaning was well done, so there
weren't any hand-sized rocks around.
I walked around the school numerous times.
I tried to find things other than stuff on the
ground.
There wasn't anything usable.
So I went to the rooftop, even though I really
didn't want to.
I opened the door slowly to make sure Misato 
wasn't there.
Nobody was on the rooftop.
I looked around and...
There were many things I could drop, like antenna
materials and tools but nothing that would make
it non-suspicious.
As I was about to give up and leave, something
caught my attention.
There was a spot on the outside wall which seemed to
be repaired numerous times.
Even though it was repaired, part of it was bent up.

[Kiri]
"Maybe I could..."

If I do it right, I could make it look like part of
the wall broke off and hit him accidentally...
However, it was on the other side of the fence.
Normally, I couldn't reach it.
But I had already made my decision...
It had to be done no matter what.
I climbed the fence carefully and got close to the
repaired part.
I put my hand in the crumbling area and used all 
my might.
It made a rugged sound and a lump of tile
and mortar came off in my hand.
It was a decent size and weight.
Then, I waited for the right moment.
When Taichi passes under, I'll drop the wall on him.
Just a little bad luck.
An unfortunate turn of events.
Unexpected mischief.

[Kiri]
"This'll work for sure."

Vengeance for Yutaka. To protect Miki.
Don't worry, nobody will ever notice...

[Kiri]
"Here he comes!"

I could see his white hair off in the distance.
There was no mistaking him.
I looked around and confirmed
there was no one else.
He was walking around the school gate.
He was alone... A perfect chance.
Come on...
He was directly under me, a perfect position!

[Kiri]
"Die..."

I threw the chunk of wall at the white devil's head.
It headed right at him...

[Kiri]
"How?!"

Taichi Kurosu who should have died in an unfortunate
accident, instantly moved towards Misato to hug her.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, Misato."

[Misato]
"Oof!"
"Pekke, why all of a sudden...?"
"You'll get kicked out of school, hugging me here."

[Taichi]
"It's unavoidable, it's an emergency!"

[Misato]
"An emergency?"

[Taichi]
"I used safety mode too much, which is making me
move on impulse!"

[Misato]
"Safety mode? Weren't you perfectly fine?"

[Taichi]
"But it's rare to see you actually 
walking to school!"
"I cleared an event with a high difficulty level,
and unlocked the safety in the process."

[Misato]
"You're troubled."

[Taichi]
"Very troubled."

[Misato]
"But you've got to take care."

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

CASE 1 Failed
I couldn't believe it failed in such a stupid way.
I probably failed because I was too serious in my
planning.
I overthought it.
Taichi Kurosu was odd and unpredictable.
I needed to come up with something that covered his
sudden mood swings.
I noticed there was a parking lot when I was walking
around the school this morning. The staff's cars
were parked there.
I didn't really know much about cars but if used
correctly, even a woman can beat a man.
But Miki mustn't notice. We spent the day together
and had lunch like normal.
CASE 2
I came up with an excuse to separate from Miki and I
waited for my target to appear.
Then...the target appeared.
He wandered around the school.
I hurried to the parking lot.
Huh... Weren't there more cars?
It bothered me, but I didn't had time to waste.
I got in a car and started the engine with a key I
found in the teachers' lounge.

[Kiri]
"It started!"

Cars nowadays were just like go-karts...
I remembered somebody telling me so.
I gripped the handle and stepped on the pedal.
The engine roared.

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

Strange.
It wouldn't move at all even though I stepped 
on the pedal.
It was just making terrible screeching sounds.
What's happening?
Kurosu Taichi would get away!

[Tomoki]
"What are you doing?"

Shima peeked on the window.

[Kiri]
"Shima! I, um..."

[Tomoki]
"You want to use the car?"

[Kiri]
"I thought it might be useful..."

[Tomoki]
"It won't move with the parking brake on."

[Kiri]
"Parking...uh...um...?"

[Tomoki]
"You also have to put it in gear."

[Kiri]
"G-gear?"

[Tomoki]
"Step on the clutch and put it in gear."

[Kiri]
"Clutch...?"

[Tomoki]
"Ugh. Let me do it."

Shima climbed in the driver's seat.

[Tomoki]
"Okay, this is the parking brake. Release it and
step on the clutch."

[Kiri]
"That's not the brake?"

[Tomoki]
"There are three pedals. The middle one 
is the brake."

It's nothing like a go-kart!

[Tomoki]
"Then you put it into gear, release the clutch and
it should move."

It moved!
*crash*
In the next instant, the car plunged into the school.

[Tomoki]
"See... Easy..."

Easy to scrap it.

[Tomoki]
"Want to try?"

[Kiri]
"The front is all smashed up and there's a balloon
coming out of the steering wheel..."

[Tomoki]
"The air bag is working. As long as that's there
you can do this many times."

[Kiri]
"I think I'll pass."

[Tomoki]
"There are plenty of other cars."

[Kiri]
"Forget it..."

[Tomoki]
"All right. Well, here is your supply."

He gave me a bag full of food.

[Kiri]
"Thank you."

Shima is kind and well-mannered but... There's
something strange about him.
CASE 2 Failed
Driving was difficult...
There was too much to remember. It'd take too long.
I'd probably crash and die while trying to learn how
to drive.
I must think of another way tomorrow...
It's best not to do something I am not used to...
Yesterday, I was like a criminal in a suspense drama.
It had to be something I was used to doing...
Otherwise it wouldn't work out.
So, today... I made lunch. Not out of love, but 
full of hatred.
CASE 3
I would leave the poisoned lunch in Taichi Kurosu's
desk.
A lunch left there by some unknown person.
Even so, that pig Taichi Kurosu would eat it.
Before, he ordered a huge lunch at the cafeteria.
If he could eat that much he wouldn't be able to
resist.
I opened the door to the classroom
as I felt confident with my plan.
Oh no!

[Kiri]
"Kirihara..."

[Touko]
"What...?"

[Kiri]
"You're...already here."

[Touko]
"Yeah. Is there a problem?"

[Kiri]
"No, it's just you're usually here later."

She seemed like she was in a really bad mood.

[Touko]
"What do you have there?"

She's got a sharp eye.

[Kiri]
"Um... I made too much for lunch."

[Touko]
"Oh. Did you bring it for Taichi?"

She looked like she wanted to eat me.
Seriously? She still had feelings for him...?

[Kiri]
"No... I just made too much."

[Touko]
"So...?"

[Kiri]
"I didn't want to waste it... So, I thought I'd 
give it to someone."

[Touko]
"..."

She stared right through me.
Pressured me without words.
She was trying to force something out of me...

[Kiri]
"Uhm... Do you, by any chance, want to eat some...?"

I couldn't handle her staring at me.
But...she'd die if she ate this.

[Touko]
"I don't want it..."

[Kiri]
"Okay..."

Thank God.

[Touko]
"Just leave it... Taichi's seat is over there."

[Kiri]
"No, someone else might be hungry."

She kept staring me down... I had no intentions of
what you are thinking...
CASE 3 Failed
That failed quickly. I spent so much time
making lunch and gathering poison.
All because Kirihara came early... All for nothing
just because of that.
I won't accept that. An unpleasant feeling spread
across my body.
Or... Do I leave a poisoned lunch? Even though
Kirihara has seen me? But if Taichi dies of food
poisoning it'd be clear that I did it...
What if by chance Touko ate it?
I'd be a murderer if she died.
I couldn't involve anyone else in this.
I guess I just have to get rid of this lunch...
Wait, there's still a chance.
CASE 3 (RETRY)
I walked aimlessly in the hallway near the
second-year's classroom.
I flaunted the lunch in my hand.
If Taichi Kurosu shows up, I'll act as usual.
And say this.
I won't give you this lunch.
That loser will surely take it from me and eat it.
I'd be the victim who got my lunch taken.
He'd get what he deserves.
This time it'll work...

[Miki]
"Kiri, I'm soooo hungry."

[Kiri]
"Miki!"

Such bad timing.

[Miki]
"Is that lunch? Let's trade."

[Kiri]
"No, Miki, it's not."

[Miki]
"Hm? It's not lunch?"

[Kiri]
"Ours is in the classroom."

[Miki]
"What about that? Who's that for?"

[Kiri]
"Leftovers... Stuff I messed up. I'm just going to
throw it out."

[Miki]
"Whaaat, that's a waste. You're cooking is good.
Taichi would be happy to eat it."

[Kiri]
"It's all messed up. I'll take it home and eat it."

CASE 3 (RETRY) Failed
Ugh... Never expected Miki to show up...
This wasn't going well. It wasn't working out the
way I planned.
I just wanted to protect Miki.

[Miki]
"Yay, rice balls!"

Miki ate the rice balls while singing.

[Miki]
"So good! You're the best!"

[Kiri]
"The filling is pre-made but I cooked the rice this
morning."

[Miki]
"Here take this. I don't need anything back."

She joyfully dumped snacks on my desk.

[Kiri]
"Nothing but snacks. Miki, you should cook at least
a little."

[Miki]
"I tried but you just keep feeding me."

Food, snacks and talking...
She's fun to eat with.
Good times.
Of course, Taichi Kurosu shows up at the 
worst timing!

[Taichi]
"Food... I'm starving..."

[Miki]
"We have some."

[Kiri]
"No we don't."

[Miki]
"Here, Kiri made it."

[Kiri]
"It's pre-made. This is for Miki and I."

[Taichi]
"Aw, come on. Let's trade."

[Miki]
"Sure."

[Kiri]
"No way."

[Taichi]
"Fine, then I'll use force!"

[Kiri]
"Aaah!"

He gobbled a meatball and a rice ball!

[Taichi]
"I'll pay for it with candy and gummies.
Youko made them."

[Kiri]
"Miki already has plenty of snacks..."

[Miki]
"Oh, they're handmade! Mmmm!"

[Taichi]
"Let's negotiate. Let me get a little more."

I really...can't stand this guy...hold on!
CASE 3 (RETRY 2)
This...was my chance.

[Kiri]
"Fine. You can have this."

I took out the poisoned lunch.

[Taichi]
"Oh! This is much bigger!"

He swooped on it like the glutton he was.

[Miki]
"These are just leftovers."

[Taichi]
"It's food, that's enough."

[Miki]
"It maybe a little old too..."

[Taichi]
"What?! Where's the quality control?! I want my
money back!"

He hesitated a little.
There were no ambulances or specialists in this
world. He if gets sick, he would be a goner.
I tried to provoke him.

[Kiri]
"That's good enough for you."
"Most of it is expired, so eat at your own risk."

[Taichi]
"Hmph, as a martial artist I won't run away 
from danger!"
"Let's see! Oh! Looks good!"

[Miki]
"Are you really going to eat that?"

[Taichi]
"I'll use my Karade skills to avoid the bad bits."

[Miki]
"Karade is useful huh?!"

Not all of the contents were poisoned.
I just mixed the poison in one section.
Now...eat it.

[Taichi]
"Oh, it's all good. Kiri you're a genius!"

[Miki]
"You can't have her though."

[Taichi]
"You took the words out of my mouth!"

What the hell?
I poisoned the food he might like but he ate right
around it.
Was it because he's a martial artist? Couldn't be...

[Miki]
"Oh, Taichi. You're not going to eat that?"

[Taichi]
"I'm not really into crab..."

[Miki]
"But don't you always order crab soup at the
cafeteria...?"

[Taichi]
"You're gravely mistaken."

[Miki]
"What about the cutlet?"

[Taichi]
"I'm already kind of full and I don't want
anything oily."

[Miki]
"So, it isn't true that you like cutlets
so much that you ate 10 slices...?"

[Taichi]
"Karade isn't about competitively eating!"

[Miki]
"So much for your Karade skills!"

I trusted too much of the school gossip.
There was only one poisoned thing left...

[Miki]
"If you don't want your omelette, I'll eat it."

[Kiri]
"Um..."

Miki, no! That's...

[Taichi]
"I wouldn't eat that if I were you. It's probably
spoiled from the heat."

[Miki]
"But it looks so good."

[Taichi]
"Part of it is undercooked."

CASE 3 (RETRY 2) Failed
I was an idiot, thinking that he would eat
everything that he would like.
How lucky can he be to completely avoid
only the poisoned foods...
What next? There was nothing I could do now.
I decided not to think of a plan that evening.
I wouldn't beat him with sneaky tricks.
CASE 4
After midnight the tension in the town eased.
No lights, no sounds. A town without people felt
mundane.
I headed towards his house with a knife in my pocket.
Only my footsteps echoed on the silent street.
If I took a roundabout way to be safe,
I would never be able to eliminate him.
I just had to ignore the danger and take a direct
route.

[Kiri]
"Here..."

There was no candle light from the window.
I listened carefully and didn't hear a single noise.
He was definitely asleep.
Should be okay.
I put my hand on the front door.
I knew it. It was unlocked.
I thought of what I was about to do
and winced for a moment.
I hesitated.
Vengeance for Yutaka. To protect Miki.
I muttered it to myself repeatedly,
then entered his home.
I headed to his room fearing that the stairs 
would creak.
All too easy.
Taichi Kurosu was asleep in his room.
Sound asleep and defenseless.
I could end this right now...
I took out the knife.
I approached cautiously, one step at a time.

[Youko]
"Don't move."

[Kiri]
"...!"

Youko stood before like a ghost.

[Youko]
"I won't approve call girls."

[Kiri]
"Call... No...ermph!"

She put her hand over my mouth.

[Youko]
"Quiet."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Youko]
"If you want to watch him sleep, do so from here."

Eyes filled with the cold urge to kill...
Fear coursed through my body.

[Youko]
"You...are dangerous."
"You're after Taichi..."

She's gonna kill me!
I edged back.

[Youko]
"I thought this might happen... See ya."

The floor beneath disappeared.

[Kiri]
"Wha?!"

I fell into the abyss.

[Kiri]
"Noooooooooooooo...!"

[Youko]
"Heheheh..."

CASE 4 Failed
Next thing I knew I was in bed at home. How? Was it
a dream? Did she really create a trap in his house?
What happened? Who took me to bed...?
Hasekura... Such a dangerous person!
I ended up not sleeping a wink.
Taichi Kurosu may have found me out. If so... I had 
no other choice.
CASE 5
I waited in the hallway. Then Taichi Kurosu came
wandering into school...
Now!

[Kiri]
"Kurosu..."

Knife out, I ran towards him. He didn't notice me
coming.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"Yaaaaaaaa!"

There was no escaping me now!

[Taichi]
"Hah!"

Taichi evaded.
A game message?

[Kiri]
"How?"

[Taichi]
"It's my Karade instincts."
"Don't try to embrace me from behind, I'll just
avoid it."

[Kiri]
"What kind of instincts are those?!"

[Taichi]
"If you're going to come at me, go for my chest."

[Kiri]
"If that's what you want..."

Taichi still hadn't noticed the knife.
And so...

[Kiri]
"Kurosu..."

I secretly held the knife and...lunged at his heart!
*thud*

[Taichi]
"Unnh...!"

I did it...
Slimy red liquid got all over my hand.
I got him this time.

[Taichi]
"Mmm, Kiri you're so soft."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

How was he okay?!
Unable to comprehend what happened,
I stepped away.

[Taichi]
"Mmm, so satisfying. Take this as a token of
appreciation."

[Kiri]
"A sandwich...?"

[Taichi]
"Youko made it."

This was her doing too?!

[Taichi]
"Oh, the tomato is a totally crushed..."

[Kiri]
"Uugggghhhh......"

"It felt like he knew every one of my move and he
was making fun of it."
Angrily, I bit into the sandwich.

[Kiri]
*munch munch*

[Taichi]
"Relax, it's all yours."

[Kiri]
"Uh wiuh keu oo nehst twime! 
(I will kill you next time!)"

CASE 5 Failed
He won't get away next time...
CASE 6
I lured him to the pool by telling him I wanted to
thank him for the sandwich.
Taichi Kurosu followed me happily.
I'll use the car battery to electrocute him 
in the pool.

[Taichi]
"It feels good. Kiri, come join!"

He swam free of worries.

[Kiri]
"What the..."

I lightly touched the water.

[Kiri]
"Aiee!"

I blacked out from an electric shock...
CASE 6 Failed
Next plan...
CASE 7
I set a trap in the cafeteria kitchen.
All the kitchen knives attacked Taichi Kurosu!
With the sacrifice of curry rolls, all the knives
were shot down!
Taichi Kurosu was completely fine.

[Kiri]
"How?! Shot down! With curry rolls?!"

[Sakuraba]
"The curry rolls! Oh, the curry rolls... 
It's so tragic!"

Sakuraba wasn't involved but he was hurt the most.
CASE 7 Failed
This time...
CASE 8
I got some nylon string and set up a perfect trap
around the school gate.
Pulling the string set the trap off.
He'd be trapped like a fly in a spider's web,
and soon he'd suffocate.

[Taichi]
"Hm...?"

Now!
I pulled on the string with all my strength.
...

[Kiri]
"Huh?!"

It tightened, and restricted the movement!
...of me.
Taichi Kurosu carried on, as if nothing ever
happened.

[Kiri]
"Taichi Kurosu!"

CASE 8 Failed
CASE 9 Failed
CASE 10 Failed
CASE 11 Failed
CASE 12 Failed
CASE 13 Failed
CASE 14 Failed
CASE 15

[Kiri]
"This is the...perfect crime..."

Final check was done. Taichi Kurosu should be coming
down this hallway soon.
I roll out a ball at the right timing. Taichi slips
and falls backwards. The vibration from the fall
will cause the pepper I set on the pillars to fall.
The pepper will fall on his face causing him
to sneeze which spins the windmill on the ceiling,
and that will pull a string...
CASE 15 Failed
CASE 35
The dead of night...at 2 am.
I walked towards a specific place.
The small shrine on the way back
from that awful camp.
That was... Kamisaka's only spiritual power spot...
At that place...

[Kiri]
"Heheh... Heheheh..."

The air was different in the surrounding forest.
It was so silent that it seemed like time 
had froze...
The small shrine in the forest was old but it had an
air of divinity to it.
I didn't know what God was worshiped there.
But I could feel it was very strong.
I nailed the doll of Taichi on the shrine's pillar.
Before coming here, I cleansed my body, dressed in
white, put on a headband, and brought two candles.
I placed a long nail on the doll
and raised a wooden hammer.

[Kiri]
"Taichi Kurosu... DIE! DIE!"

In its throat, its arm, its stomach, and feet...
I drove the nails with hatred.

[Kiri]
"Die! Die! Die! Die! Die...!"

The doll was soon in tatters.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka, I did it! I did it! I killed Taichi!
You have been avenged!"
"Hahah... Ahahah... Ahahahah... Easy... So easy!"

CASE 48 Failed
CASE 69

[Kiri]
"Mayday... Misty to Richie... I'm engaging the enemy
without weapons... Send arms to dimension 11..."
"Nothing can be done... Eliminate the target directly
with a space-time rift cross-buster bullet..."
"The target is moving directly below...
The coordinates are 59, 6201, 40, 219..."
"FIRE!"
"A DIRECT HIT...!"

Taichi Kurosu had been hit with a bullet from
another dimension.
His ethereal and astral bodies have been destroyed.

[Kiri]
"I did it...!"

But the target walked undisturbed below.

[Kiri]
"Impossible... HOW?!"

CASE 69 Failed
CASE 107
There was something wrong with me lately.
Fear made me unstable.
I was better now, I was at ease.
Totally relaxed.
This next plan was perfect.
A pit, three meters in diameter
and three meters deep.
Wooden spikes were planted at the bottom.
If he falls in, he's a goner.
All I had to do was call for him and wait...

[Miki]
"Hey Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"STOP! Miki, stop! Stop!"

[Miki]
"Don't worry, I noticed the pit."

[Kiri]
"Huh? How did you..."

[Miki]
"The dirt is a different color from the surrounding. 
Taichi wouldn't fall for such an obvious trap."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Miki]
"He won't come anyway. He got tired of you
so he's helping out with the club..."

[Kiri]
"Tired of me...?"

[Miki]
"You two were playing around every day."

[Kiri]
"Playing...around...?"

[Miki]
"Recently you've been kinda pitiful so he asked me
to check on you."

CASE 107 Failed

[Miki]
"Kiri... Do you really want to kill Taichi?"

[Kiri]
"...!"
"..."

I nodded silently.

[Miki]
"...I see."

[Kiri]
"Are you mad? Are you going to shun me?"

[Miki]
"C'mon Kiri, I came to help!"
"Tada! An US-made crossbow!"

She carelessly took it out from under her skirt.

[Kiri]
"Wh-Where did you hide that?!"

[Miki]
"Don't sweat the details!"
"I'll lend it to you."

She handed me the extremely heavy crossbow.

[Kiri]
"Miki, this..."

[Miki]
"I found it in the nerd's house."

[Kiri]
"You don't mind? I can use this on Taichi...?"

[Miki]
"I told you. I'm on your side."

She finally noticed! Out of joy, it made me cry.

[Kiri]
"Miki... Thank you."

[Miki]
"Tomorrow everyone will gather on the rooftop."

Tomorrow was the day.
CASE 108
The following day, Sunday.
I was prepared and on the rooftop.
I laid on top of the stairs to the rooftop, hiding.
Just as Miki said, everyone gathered on the rooftop.
Misato, Kirihara, Shima, Sakuraba...
And... Taichi Kurosu.
Miki wasn't there.
I persuaded her not to come.
I didn't see Hasekura.
If she got in the way again...
Even so, with this crossbow...
She couldn't stop a high-speed arrow.
I spent a day practicing with the crossbow.
I've got this... I can do it.
I aimed carefully.
I slowly and silently squeezed the trigger...
The arrow went straight for Taichi Kurosu.
*thud*
Taichi Kurosu fell slowly...
Everyone froze, everything went silent,
and time stood still...
I did it... I finally did it!

[Taichi]
"HAHAHAHAHAH!"

His dead body...got up like nothing happened.

[Kiri]
"No way! How? Is it magic...?"

[Youko]
"Heheheh..."

[Kiri]
"Hasekura..."

[Youko]
"You can't kill Taichi. Everything was just as
planned."

[Kiri]
"Why go out of your way and do such elaborate thing?"

[Youko]
"Taichi doesn't want your expulsion."

[Kiri]
"He knew... He enjoyed watching me fail?"
"You spied on me and ruined all of my plans..."

[Youko]
"Only twice. You screwed up the rest."

[Kiri]
"L-liar! It must have been you!"

[Youko]
"Have fun playing the role of an assassin?"

[Kiri]
"Aw..."

[Youko]
"Heheheh..."

[Kiri]
"Don't laugh! I will kill him! I will kill 
Taichi Kurosu!"

I had to. I didn't care how many times I failed... A
thousand, a million... Eventually, I will kill
Taichi Kurosu.
