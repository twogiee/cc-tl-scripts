Today was hot.
I felt like going to the beach.
Which reminded me... Last year, we all went to the
beach together.
That was a good time.
I could remember everyone frolicking around
like it was yesterday.

[Touko]
"Heeeeey! Where do you think you're grabbing?!"

[Taichi]
"The material that covers your butt."

[Misato]
"I wonder what relationship Hasekura and Taichi
have..."

[Taichi]
"Hm, my little Youko?"

[All 4]
"My little Youko?!"

[Misato]
"N-not my body!"

[Yusa]
"Oh, uhm, excuse me me me meeeee!"

[Touko]
"Idiot!"

[Yusa]
"Oh, it's coming... It's cominggg!"

[Miki]
"Ow, ouch! My forehead hurts!"

[Misato]
*grumble grumble*

[Taichi]
"It was pretty fun, though."

And with that, swim time had been over.
It seemed like Miki's injury would only leave a
small scar.
Even then, she went home happy.
Like she had gained something in exchange for her
injury.
Well, at least that's what her face had said.
After that, Misato and I had gone back to school so
I could help her install the broadcast club's
antenna.
Tomoki had said something sarcastic to his sister.
And Miki, who was still a third year at Gunjo,
teased him and his unnatural attachment to his
sister.
Yusa had opened up a little to the group for the
first time.
That was the kind of day at the beach we had.
