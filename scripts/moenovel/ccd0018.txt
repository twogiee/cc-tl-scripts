At night, Tomoki brought a box of food.
I picked out a few things and prepared dinner.
Then I fell into my bed in my room and thought about
everything.

"..."

The search for a happy ending.
I guess this fits in with what I am doing.
Though I'd made every effort to understand
everyone's problems, things still hadn't gone the
way I wanted it to.
On top of that, I only had a week.
Every time I managed to grow close to someone, the
week was finished.
I'd need seven weeks, for all members.
Even if I were to leave out Sakuraba, Tomoki, and
Youko...
I'd still need four weeks...
If I could somehow work four times more
efficiently... No...that wouldn't solve it...

[Taichi]
"Damn..."

Without any solution coming to mind...I dozed off...
