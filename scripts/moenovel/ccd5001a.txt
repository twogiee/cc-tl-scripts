And so, I woke up.
I checked beyond the thicket.
This was the last time I was going to use this place.
There was only one left...
Youko Hasekura...
I had to carry this out more carefully.
Failure was not an option.
I couldn't let Youko sense my defiance towards her.
Also, there was one thing I must keep mind.

[Taichi]
"No need of the memories..."

There was no lunch box waiting.
That strayed from the usual pattern.

[Taichi]
"..."

It made me uneasy.
As soon as everyone disappeared, her behavioral
patterns had also changed...

[Taichi]
"...Damn it."

That was an unpleasant start.
I tried not to act pretentiously.
I thought she would be easy to deceive, since she was
so blind for love...
Did I underestimate her?
I had nothing to support my theory.

[Taichi]
"Calm down."

I guess I'll head outside.
Youko was waiting for me there.

[Taichi]
"...?!"

She was smiling.

[Taichi]
"What..."

[Youko]
"It's just the two of us."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Youko]
"Heheheh."
"Just the two of us, Taichi."

I wanted to run away.
That's what my instincts told me.
My heart started to race and I couldn't think
clearly.
Pressure was what I felt.

[Taichi]
"...Are you really that happy?"

If I didn't focus, I couldn't speak.

[Youko]
"Yes, because I've been waiting for this."

[Taichi]
"I see."

[Youko]
"Taichi... Can I kiss you?"

[Taichi]
"Uhh...sure."

She walked up without a sound and put her arm around
my neck.
I was caught.
Then she kissed me.

[Youko]
"Mm..."

She lightly nibbled my upper lip then pulled away.

[Youko]
"The rest will have to wait."

She disappeared.

[Taichi]
"Uhh. Yeah. Later..."

I had to catch her off guard.
I had to keep her off guard.
Whatever it takes...
So I can...

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

I noticed that the sandwich wrapper was pressed
against my chest.

[Taichi]
"I came to school and yet..."

I scratched my head.
Nobody was around.
But... I guess I'll have a look around.
For whatever reason, I didn't feel right if I wasn't
at school during the day.
The classroom was dead silent.
No signs of life whatsoever.
I felt so lonely.
I didn't think I could take this for long.
I left the classroom.
What I saw was even more expansive and deserted.
I sat in my usual chair.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

I took a breather, but there was nothing to do.
I couldn't contact anyone without electricity.

[Taichi]
"I need to live a slower life."

But people grew impatient by nature.
This sucks...

[Taichi]
"But before I do..."

I remembered the tension.

[Taichi]
"I have to deal with her..."

The antenna.
The unfinished business.
I couldn't meet with Misato anymore.
The possibility of the antenna being built has
disappeared with her.
There was a dangerous part of the fence.
A problem not fixed in the other world too.

[Taichi]
"It was a drainage problem, right?"

No matter how many attempts were made to fix it,
this section remained damp and gradually weakened.
The rooftop didn't feel like it was part of the
school.
It seemed so close to the sky...it felt like a
different world.
I can see the whole town surrounded by nature.

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

I spotted smoke coming from the mountains.

[Taichi]
"A ninja?"
"What the hell am I saying..."

I tapped the side of my head.
I guess a tiny bit of optimism still remained.

[Taichi]
"Maybe it's just a forest fire?"

No, not likely...

[Taichi]
"Hmm. Maybe it's Youko."

But why the fire?

[Taichi]
"No...wait..."

Dashing moments after thinking about a life of
leisure.
Jeez...it's a real tough one.
I entered the bushes.
I was getting closer to the shrine.
What could she be possibly doing here?
I heard a pop on the other side of the bushes.
I made my way to it.

[Taichi]
"No..."

It was burning.
Everything was.
All the journals...was dancing in the fire, turning
into ashes.
My brain shut down but I still felt a shiver going
down my spine.

[Taichi]
"What...are you doing?"

She responded to me as if we were having a normal
conversation.

[Youko]
"I'm burning everything..."

[Taichi]
"Burning..."

Why would she do such a thing?
Don't you realize that all these records hold the
facts about what we've been through?

[Taichi]
"Burning it won't do us any favors."

I said it with a relaxed tone that was not fit for
the situation I experienced.
I spoke like a robot... Words came out as it crossed
my mind. I was completely shocked with the
situation.
She didn't respond to me. I guess it wasn't taken as
a question.

[Taichi]
"Stop that."

Silence.
She just stared at the pile of notebooks on fire.

[Taichi]
"Hey..."

My heart gradually grew impatient.
I swallowed my saliva and shouted.

[Taichi]
"Put it out!"

In response, she turned and looked at me.

[Youko]
"It's no longer necessary."
"You don't need to understand what's going on,
Taichi."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

I didn't need to understand?
I didn't need to know about what's going on in this
world?

[Taichi]
"Give me a break! Why wouldn't I? I'm putting it
out!"

I picked up a stick and made a move to break up the
pile on fire.
She grabbed my wrist.

[Taichi]
"Why...?"

[Youko]
"Don't."
"The fire is too fierce. It's dangerous to go near
it."

A great amount of time has passed since I saw the
smoke coming up.
Most of the documents had already been reduced to
ashes.
Black ashes were floating above the fire, staining
the air.

[Taichi]
"You idiot. If you do this..."

[Youko]
"We'll no longer know."

[Taichi]
"Yeah...and if we die, everything will go back to
square one."

I haven't been doing too bad.
But there was no guarantee I wouldn't die.
Illnesses, accidents...sudden fits of rage.
Even if I were to die, those documents would show
where I stood.
My emergency measure had just been reduced to ashes.
She twisted my wrist which made me drop the stick.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

[Youko]
"I'm the only one who needs to know what's
necessary."

[Taichi]
"Youko..."

That's when I realized.
What she was plotting.

[Taichi]
"My thoughts..."

[Youko]
"Yeah, I know. You're an open book."

[Taichi]
"..."

And I knew what came after that, too.

[Taichi]
"You want to reconstruct who I am..."

[Youko]
"Yes."

The current me.
Basically, my will to live my own life wasn't
necessary for her plan.
The me who is trying to create memories and live on
my own.
She knew that I was trying to send her back.
But she kept it to herself.
Of course she did.
The others were only in her way.
She only needed me.
But not the me who I was now.
The me who knew nothing.

[Taichi]
"So you're gonna hole yourself up in the shrine."

[Youko]
"Yeah, that's the plan."

[Taichi]
"It'll be easy for you to manipulate me if you're
the only one who remembers everything..."

[Youko]
"That's right."

I thought I would know better...
She smiled like a mannequin.
It gave me goosebumps.

[Youko]
"I've put up with a lot of bullying from you."
"But now it's your turn."
"Nothing harmful though."

[Taichi]
"You're okay telling me that?"

[Youko]
"Yes. I don't want to keep anything from you."

[Taichi]
"But you do know that, even if my memory is reset, I
may still be able to find the truth on my own."

[Youko]
"This fire is to ensure that doesn't happen."
"Without these documents, you're unlikely to figure
out the shrine's system."

[Taichi]
"..."

True.
She was the one who left notes.
She was simply guiding me.
She held me close and looked into my eyes.
Into the very depths of my soul.

[Youko]
"Taichi, information is vital for this world."
"The world can be ruled with information."
"Investment is about how much information you have,
right?"
"Whoever holds the most information is capable of
ruling the world."
"I've lived my life so I can be that ruler."
"And until that happens..."

[Taichi]
"It's not too late to become one now too..."
"Just become what you want when you go back to the
other world."

This was her we're talking about.
She probably already knows what I have been doing to
other members who were gone.

[Youko]
"I didn't have any other goals, so I just went with
what I had to work with. It doesn't mean I like it."
"I only need you in my life, Taichi."

She caressed my cheek.

[Taichi]
"You've gone mad..."

[Youko]
"The look on your face is what it used to be and it
makes me happy."
"You've been far more dull lately."

[Taichi]
"You've turned into quite the talker..."

I said it coldly.

[Taichi]
"The old you was a lot more cuter than now."

[Youko]
"I guess we both have changed..."

She laughed out loud.

[Taichi]
"Something might happen to you too. Wouldn't it be
hard for you to do anything without the
information?"

[Youko]
"If I just spend my Sunday evenings near the shrine,
the loop will occur and I'll know."
"Even if I didn't have the knowledge, there still
are possibilities it will occur."
"And that's good enough for me."
"Our relationship will be a phenomenon."
"The phenomenon known as us."
"For all eternity..."

With a flicker, the flame consumed the last of the
mountain of notebooks.

[Taichi]
"Aren't you a bastion of logic."

With her bewitching smile, she drew closer to my
lips.

[Taichi]
"..."

As I looked up at the ceiling, I laid in bed.
She beat me to the punch.
Maybe...she was also living in her own time.
That was the feeling I got at least.
But how?
Either there were other spots or she was hidden near
the shrine.
At any rate, she definitely knew what was going on.
Of course, she also knew that I've been avoiding
her.

[Taichi]
"Damn it."

My strength was not to become serious in any kind of
situation but that was also my weakness at the same
time.

[Taichi]
"Youko Hasekura, huh?"

The likelihood of sending her back has decreased
dramatically.
And at that rate, the current me would be erased.
The only reason why I am able to relax in my bedroom
was because she was still underestimating me.
I guess it's really not underestimating if she knows
what I am capable of doing...
I could try to overpower her and force her back.
But it was extremely unlikely I'd succeed.
She had an instinct like that of a beast... And I
was not capable to go up against it.
Who knew what weapons she had at her disposal?

[Taichi]
"Man..."

I was in serious trouble.
The current me would cease to exist.
A real identity crisis.
Basically, by this week I had to catch her and send
her back.
This was the only way to survive.

[Taichi]
"It's impossible..."

I could show up in a tank and still lose.

[Taichi]
"But if I were to try to force her out..."

When would I have the greatest chance of success?
I thought it through.
The highest chance of success would be today.
Weekend was nearing, so I knew for sure she would be
extremely cautious of every move I made.
Less days left.
That meant that the chance of the current me to
exist decreases.
Taking all of the factors into account... Today was
undoubtedly the best day to strike.
Today was the only day I could catch her off guard.

[Taichi]
"..."

I needed more time for preparation though.
How should I prepare for and what should I prepare
for the attack?
The first thing I need to do... I need to keep her in
one place till Sunday.
Imprisonment.

[Taichi]
"Weapons."

What about weapons?
Weapons to resist her.
I couldn't kill her.
Once she was sent back, she'll go back to living in
normal time.
She needed to be sent back alive.

[Taichi]
"I need to neutralize her..."

And to do that...

[Taichi]
"I need a stun gun or something."

I'm sure I saw a Myotron somewhere.
I searched the room.
It didn't take long to find it.
A Myotron was like a stun gun with a silencer. If it
comes in contact with a person, it could interfere
with their brain waves.
The effectiveness differed from person to person,
but it's capable of stopping the target for at
least ten minutes.
The problem was how to hit her with it.
There were many ways to deceive her.
She'd catch on if I tried to be covert about it.
That's why I needed to be face to face with her and
be sweet.

[Taichi]
"This may do the trick..."

It would be great if it worked.
I couldn't use a crossbow or any other deadly
weapons.
I'll take some extra batteries just to be safe.
I'm finished if she suspects anything, so heavy
weaponry was out.
I'd approach and restrain her.
Even if she ended up somewhat injured.

[Taichi]
"The problem is...how long should I restrain her..."

Of course, till the day I send her back, which is in
a week, I have to imprison her.
I had to feed her and clean her up during
imprisonment.
The longer she was imprisoned, the greater the risk.

[Taichi]
"I have no other choice..."

I sat up.
I needed to hurry up and prepare a room.

[Taichi]
"Okay then..."

I took a deep breath.
I headed to her house.
And as I stepped out onto the path shrouded in
darkness...
She was there.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"..."

How should I express my current feelings?
Series of astonishment and surprise was whirling
inside of me.
But I'm done for if my behavior seemed off to her.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

I approached her.
Each step felt heavy.
In the literal sense.

[Taichi]
"Umm, so yeah, I was feeling hungry and..."
"I thought you might be willing to cook for me, you
know."
"Your cooking is phenomenal."
"Warm food tastes much better than canned goods."
"With everyone gone, I don't feel as embarrassed
being spoiled by you."
"I know I've been kind of cold to you all this time."
"So I decided to be more honest and open towards
you."

Step by step, I drew closer to her.
My acting was flawless. I was my usual self.

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah. How about just come back to my place."
"After all, it is just the two of us."
"We'll be together like before, but our lives won't
be as hopeless."
"Just the two of us."

Shrouded in a light veil of darkness, only her mouth
was accentuated by the moonlight.
She had a smile.
I felt a chill in my spine.
Why was she here?
I felt faint as my mind groped for a reason.
If she killed me now...
The me that knows nothing will be hers next week.

[Taichi]
"So..."
"You know, I've always..."
"Since we were kids..."

I reached my limit.
I kicked the dirt.
And I ran.
I pretended to fall forward and picked up a pebble.
I threw it at her face.
She caught it with one hand.
But I was in close range of her now.
I stuck out the Myotron.
The tip hit her in the abdomen.
I didn't mind taking her down with me.
I rushed into her at full speed and tried to push
the Myotron in deeper.
And...
I was driven into the ground.
She was on my back.
And my arm, perfectly restrained.
I couldn't move at all.
I was pinned down with my face and right hand held
against the ground.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

[Youko]
"Taichi... Look."

She whispered to me so softly and sweetly.

[Youko]
"You and I, were meant to be together."

[Taichi]
"Ugh...uhh..."

[Youko]
"Who else would be able to survive you?"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Youko]
"I know I'm no match for you when you're serious..."
"But even if you were serious, I can run away from
you."
"Every beast has its tamer."
"I am yours."

She kissed my cheek.
And her hand touched my neck.
It tightened, and my breathing stopped.
And within seconds...
My consciousness sunk into the darkness.

[Taichi]
"Mm..."

I woke up with a mild heartburn.

[Taichi]
"...Is this..."

It was my room.
The stuff for imprisonment was pushed to the side.
I was imprisoned in the place where I planned to use
for her.

[Taichi]
"What's going on here?"

I asked as I stifled a yawn.

[Youko]
"You've been confined, because the you of this week
still remembers."

[Taichi]
"You're really treating me like a beast, huh."

[Youko]
"You just have to hold on for a week..."

[Taichi]
"Can I use the restroom?"

[Youko]
"Diapers will do."

[Taichi]
"Are you serious...?"

[Youko]
"Dead serious."

There goes my dignity as a human being.

[Youko]
"It's fine. Yours don't bother me."

[Taichi]
"Ugh. Don't say that."

So I couldn't even go to a proper restroom.

[Youko]
"Here's your food."

[Taichi]
"At least let me use one of my hands."

[Youko]
"Sorry but no."

[Taichi]
"..."

Oh well.
I needed to preserve my strength.

[Taichi]
"I can't eat like this."

[Youko]
"Open wide."

[Taichi]
"..."

This was embarrassing on so many levels.
Well, at least no one was around to see it.
...
I was left totally alone for an entire day.

[Taichi]
"Wow..."

My back hurt.
I couldn't even turn over in my sleep.
All I had was time to think...
Youko showed up.

[Taichi]
"What...?"

[Youko]
"Water."

She lifted the cup to my mouth.
Her hand held my chin.
I felt extremely parched.
I really needed the drink.

[Taichi]
"?"

Something felt off.
But I drank it all.

[Taichi]
"Umm... Was there medicine in that?"

She left without responding.

[Taichi]
"No food?!"

Was she trying to starve me to a certain point?
This was hard.
A few moments later, she came back.
Meal time.
Stew and bread.
A sophisticated meal in this day and age.
My appetite was doing back flips.
I still couldn't use my hands, so she had to feed me.
She cleaned around my mouth using hers.
I could smell her.
Somewhere below my hip was feeling uncomfortable.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

I took a deep breath.
I guess she wasn't trying to starve me into submission.
She took the tableware and left.
She returned with a bucket of hot water and a towel.

[Taichi]
"W-what now...?"

She peeled off my clothes.

[Taichi]
"Stop! Pervert!"

Moving around didn't do anything.
As she exposed me, she tickled my nipples and did
other things to tease me.

[Taichi]
"You're teasing me?!"

She started cleaning me with the damp towel.
My face. Behind my ears.
My arms. My armpits.
My belly. My back.
My butt. My legs.

[Taichi]
"Aaagh."

She carefully cleaned me.

[Youko]
"All done."

She dropped the towel into the bucket.
She stood there.

[Taichi]
"Did you need something else?"

[Youko]
"Your body smells good."

She touched my abdomen.

[Taichi]
"Um..."

She started rubbing it.
She rubbed it as if she were drawing circles.

[Youko]
*chuckle*

The area behind my ears went numb.

[Taichi]
"Stop it..."

[Youko]
"I will not."

Her face drew near.
She lightly kissed me on the lips.

[Taichi]
"Damn it all..."

Seriously...damn it...
...

[Youko]
"See you tomorrow."

She smiled sweetly and left the room.

[Taichi]
"..."
*sigh*

I was finally able to relax.
That witch...
I couldn't really sleep that night.

[Taichi]
*groan*

Wednesday.
I made a decision to think about human dignity.

[Taichi]
*sniffle*

I felt like crying.

[Taichi]
"Oooo. Ahhh."

I wriggled around a bit.

[Taichi]
"I... I..."

I tried to bend my body backward.

[Taichi]
"Oh my, oh my, oh my."

I convulsed.

[Taichi]
"Need restroom!"

I yelled with all of my heart.
Restroom. What I desired.
Restroom. Symbol of human dignity.
Restroom. Symbol of humanity.
Now I understand the difficulty of taking care of
the elderly and how the elderly felt when taken care
of.

[Taichi]
"Oh no! I can't hold it no longer!! Please! Help!"

The door opened.

[Youko]
"Morning."

[Taichi]
"What horrible timing!"

On top of that, she was carrying some dangerous
objects.

[Taichi]
"W-what's are those?"

I couldn't believe my eyes.
A bucket...and an enema syringe.

[Taichi]
"You have to be kidding me?!"

I cried as I shook my head.

[Taichi]
"Whatever happened to human rights?!"

[Youko]
"..."

She looked calm, but was slightly blushing.
Was she feeling inferior?!

[Taichi]
"Peace to all *! (ASSterisk).
Peace to all *! (ASSterisk)."

She picked up the syringe.

[Taichi]
"Noooo! You're inhuman!"
*sob*

She returned with food.

[Taichi]
*sob*

I wept in anguish.

[Youko]
"Still crying?"

[Taichi]
*cry*

I wanted to cry forever.
This hurt more than that time, I failed in stock.

[Youko]
"I brought you food."
"Okay. Open wide."

[Taichi]
"..."

My stomach growled just as I thought about staging a
hunger strike.
The body opposed the mind.

[Youko]
"Eat, Taichi, okay?"

Gently.
She forced my mouth open.

[Taichi]
"Huh?!"

In the end, she fed me like a baby.
But it was really good.

[Youko]
"Oh, you're dirty."

She licked me around my mouth.

[Taichi]
"Eeek."

[Youko]
"I'll clean your ears."

[Taichi]
"Why?!"

Her tongue was inside my ear.

[Taichi]
"Be gone, vile succubus! Be gooone!"

This was heaven and hell (pain and pleasure)!

[Youko]
"I'll clean you all over."

Wahhh.

[Taichi]
"You perverted woman!"

She teased the hell out of me.
She looked like she was having the time of her life.
