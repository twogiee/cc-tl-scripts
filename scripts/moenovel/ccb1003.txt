[Miki]
"Oh, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

I encountered Miki, who was leaning against the wall.
As far as I could tell, she wasn't surprised.
Maybe she was just controlling herself.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating well?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, thanks to the club."

[Taichi]
"Club started already?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

The official name: Life Support Activities Club.

[Taichi]
"Kiri's also going there too?"

[Miki]
"Yeah. She's great."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, she is."

[Miki]
"I wonder why you don't show up."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, well, you know Kiri doesn't like me..."

Kiri came out of the bathroom just as I finished
speaking.

[Taichi]
"Did you flush?"

[Miki]
"How could you ask that?!"

*grrr*
Kiri ground her teeth.

[Kiri]
"Taichi Kurosu!"

She was so rude.
She was acting like she was my sworn enemy.

[Kiri]
"..."

She faced me with an icy stare.
Kiri acted like that all the time.
I couldn't let it get to me.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, such beautiful skin you always have."

I tried to touch it.

[Kiri]
"Don't touch me!"

She slapped my hand down.
*throb*

[Taichi]
"Nice..."

[Kiri]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"No."

I pushed my bangs away.

[Miki]
"You two shouldn't fight."

[Taichi]
"Fighting? I'm not that uncivilized."
"I'd rather decide this more gracefully."

[Kiri]
"So are you trying to pick a fight with me,
Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Hmph. If you'll go one-on-one with me tonight."

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki."

Kiri grabbed Miki, and spun away from me.

[Taichi]
"Let's go, we'll all be late!"

I went with them.
...We were good together.
Like three flowers, three sisters!
Three ladies, with a story of beautiful love!
Just kidding...

[Kiri]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"You noticed me!"

[Kiri]
"I'd have to be blind not to notice one as stupid as
you!"

[Taichi]
"But I'm invisible."

[Kiri]
"Not wrong, I can see right through you,
understand?"

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

Kiri didn't laugh.

[Kiri]
"You're so insolent, even now."

[Taichi]
"Don't praise me! I'll be embarrassed."

[Kiri]
"..."
"But I know...so..."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Kiri]
"I'm never going to let my guard down when I'm
around you."

They walked away.

[Taichi]
*sigh*

What was this feeling?
This pressure...of being around them.
I called out to both of them.

[Taichi]
"Hey, you two!"

They stopped, and only Miki turned.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

I hesitated.

[Taichi]
"Look after yourselves okay?"

Just innocuous words.
But being separated from civilization meant you had
to watch your health.
Miki waved happily, while Kiri just glared.
