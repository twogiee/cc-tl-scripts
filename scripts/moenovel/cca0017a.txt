[Misato]
"Oh..."

I looked at Misato's lower half (not in a dirty way,
this time), exposed to the bright sunlight.
I saw...bite marks around the bleeding on her leg.
The marks perfectly surrounded the wound, which was
coated in a small patch of thinly spread blood.
It looked almost as if someone had tried to bite
into the wound.
No.
Any way you looked at it, that's exactly what it
was.

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Do you...hate me?"

[Misato]
"Hate?"

[Taichi]
"The..."

I couldn't find the words.
How could I explain the actions and feelings
that are so hard for me to decipher?

[Taichi]
"Because..."

She smiled at me suddenly.

[Misato]
"You didn't do anything to make me hate you,
Taichi."

[Taichi]
"You...mean it?"

But...
I gazed at her wound.
But she gently covered it with her skirt.

[Misato]
"I'm a naive girl so I'll feign ignorance."
"Besides, you helped me with the club."

[Taichi]
"..."
"But let me help you with that at least."

[Misato]
"Okay."

I helped her with her wounds again.
This time, I had no seizure.
Because I was happy.
Because I felt good.

[Misato]
"It's ticklish!"

[Taichi]
"S-sorry... I'm nervous."

[Misato]
"You're not very good at wrapping bandages."

[Taichi]
"Well, I don't have any experience..."

[Misato]
"It's...ticklish!"

[Taichi]
"Hmmmm..."

It was a happy time.
But then...

[Misato]
"Ah!"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Where did my cell phone go?"

[Taichi]
"Your cell phone?"

The conversation had turned to the mundane.
I could no longer think straight.

[Misato]
"I think I dropped it."

She made a very troubled face.

[Taichi]
"I'll look for it. It's got to be on the rooftop."

[Misato]
"Thank you."

I left the nurse's room and went to the rooftop.
Her cell phone was easy to find.
It had fallen among a bunch of papers.

[Taichi]
"Why did she need her cell phone, anyway?"

It should be obvious.

[Taichi]
"I see."

I came to the answer.
Everyone depended on something,
in one way or another.
Misato probably put a great deal of trust into that
tiny cell phone. Just like I did in...

[Taichi]
"Here it is."

[Misato]
"Oh, yeah."

She took it with a huge grin on her face.

[Misato]
"Good job. This makes us even."

[Taichi]
"What?"

Her face changed a little while she kept smiling.
It was like she heard a bad joke.

[Taichi]
"You really forgave me quickly."

[Misato]
"That's because I'm a Gunjo girl."
"So, will it happen again?"

[Taichi]
"I don't know. It's possible."
"It was almost like a seizure."

[Misato]
"Well, I'll chalk this one up to extenuating
circumstances."

[Taichi]
"You're too sweet."

[Misato]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi, you're too nice."
"I'm not one of those harmless schoolboys, you
know."

[Misato]
"But when I said stop, you stopped, right?"

Did I?
I don't think I understood her words at that time.
Coincidence?
It must have been.
Still, I wondered.

[Taichi]
"It probably wouldn't be good to become
close...well...like this..."

My sentence trailed off from there.
It was a silent summer.
So silent that the pressures of club activities and
classwork disappeared.
Just a white nurse's room, filled with tranquility.
The world was bathed in twilight. The room was an
alabaster womb, offering us from its embrace as a
sacrifice to the evening sun.
The evening colors left the strongest impression of
any time of the day.
The world seemed to become a different world
entirely.
It was a time of destruction.
A time when worlds could be seen layered on top of
each other.
Who could be sure that the sun that set the day
before was the same one that rose the next day?
Who could say the world wasn't perishing every day?
How would anyone even be able to tell?
There was no way to know.
There was no way to know if the reality observed by
humans was in fact the same as the real external
world.
But at this moment, the nurse's room felt like a
small sanctuary from the invading scarlet evening.
I could see the world in an unusually vivid way.

[Misato]
"Nobody's perfect, right?"
"Everyone is strange in one way or another."
"You can't live your life trying to erase every
imperfection and mistake."
"Don't you think so?"

[Taichi]
"..."

If I were to shed even a single tear, I would look really
lame.
Amazingly, I hid my overwhelming emotions.

[Taichi]
"I was alone, and you invited me to the club,
so I r-respect you."

I let out.
She looked out for me.
We silently passed the time together.

[Taichi]
"I can't stand being hated, and I don't want to hurt
anyone."
"I'm really sorry for what happened."
"But I'm not confident I can control myself."

[Misato]
"What should I do?"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"How can I be more careful? What can I do?"

[Taichi]
"Well..."

I calmly gathered my thoughts.

[Taichi]
"If we make sure I don't see your blood..."

[Misato]
"So I should be careful not to get injured, then?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"But things like installing antennas and using tools
carry the risk of getting injured."

[Taichi]
"Sure, so I shouldn't be around when you-"

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She interrupted with her plea.

[Misato]
"You'll help me with the physical work, right?"

[Taichi]
"..."

Her words struck me.
Something shook deep inside of my ribs.
"You're always alone, right?"
"Would you like to join my club?"
Those words would forever be etched into my mind.
They were overwhelmingly warm, soft, and powerful.
The troubles which I couldn't resolve on my own were
erased by another's simple words.
I think that was why humans communicated.
With words, bodies, and phones.
With transmissions.
Any way they possible could.
When humans are in contact with other people, they
gain strength.
That's what it meant to be human.

[Misato]
"I'll need your help installing things."

[Taichi]
"Yes."

It was embarrassing.
Misato smiled happily.
Youko sometimes told me that I was a strong person.
I didn't like people assigning such values to me.
No.
Other people were often strong.
Mimi always put me in a mischievous mood,
called me out on my BS, and left me fascinated.
Those kinds of things... I couldn't possibly do
alone.
I just wanted to be next to her.
As long and as often as I could.
Until the end of days.
I still had time to make that happen.

[Taichi]
"I'm looking forward to it."

[Misato]
"Me too."

I hung my head.
When Misato plopped her hand on top of it.
The action caught me by surprise.
And I laughed.
And like that, things were back to normal.
I was so happy I could have cried.
Misato drew open the curtains.
And the nurse's room was abruptly flooded in orange.
