[Sakuraba]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed Sakuraba a mask.

[Sakuraba]
"Thanks."

He put it on without a single question.

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"Have you not eaten?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm prepping for first period."

[Taichi]
"Eating curry rolls is what you call a class?"

[Sakuraba]
"It sure is...until all the curry rolls are gone."

He responded coolly.
Just like in the journal.

[Taichi]
"Just eat some ready-made curry."

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."

The records also suggested that.
Events steadily continued to match the journals.

[Sakuraba]
"Hexshoo!"

[Taichi]
"A hexagonal tragedy, yes..."

This was in the journal too.
The frequency of similarities occurring
was now over 15\p.
I calculated that one out of seven times, a snot
bridge event would occur.
So as an enlightened soul (me), I ended up providing
him with a mask to negate the situation.

[Sakuraba]
"Can I take off the mask now...?"

[Taichi]
"I can't allow that."

[Sakuraba]
"Life...sure is rough."

[Taichi]
"Took the words right out of my mouth."
