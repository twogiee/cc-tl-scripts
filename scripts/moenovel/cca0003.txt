The new school term started today.
In our utterly masculine house, there was no
cartoonish morning fuss getting up and going to
school, I just got up and left.
It was my first time back in a month and a half.
The weather was lovely.
It was still early September, but it wasn't too hot.
My hair fluttered in my eyes.
That was about all I had to complain about.

[Taichi]
"I really should have cut it..."

So annoying.
I'm not a big fan of my hair, partly because of the
color.

[Taichi]
"Whaa..."

I walked on toward school, messing with my hair.
One foot in front of the other.
I should get someone to cut it.
Yeah, I'll do that.

[Girl]
"Morning!"

[Taichi]
"Morning to you, too!"

A girl on a bike rode up beside me, as if
approaching me out of the blue was the most natural
thing in the world.
She stayed there wobbling, but keeping her balance.
It was hard to ride at a walking pace without
falling.
She was on an expensive-looking mountain bike.
It suited her cheerful aura.

[Girl]
"Whoops!"

She pulled a little wheelie.
Oh, I got a peek at her panties...
White. So white.
Pure white.
Oh yes, pure white panties are so good. So very
good.
I wanted to see more.
But no more for me.
How sad.

[Girl]
"Hey Taichi, have you ever been to the hills way out
there?"

The girl, who stole my manly heart with just a
single piece of fabric, turned towards me.

[Taichi]
"I have. I went camping there the other day."

[Girl]
"During summer break?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Girl]
"Ah, that..."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Girl]
"It's just, there's a god there."

We briefly made eye contact.
And then, at the same time...

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahah!"

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahahahah!"
"Oh man, it's just soaking in god's grace!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I'll try to stop laughing."

[Girl]
"No, no, it's totally normal to laugh. If someone
said that to me with a straight face I'd laugh,
too."

[Taichi]
"I thought you were trying to make me laugh, saying
it like that."

[Girl]
"Well, maybe a little... But I'm serious, though."

[Taichi]
"About the god?"

[Girl]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"You know, god in Spanish is dios!"

We briefly made eye contact.

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahah!"

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahahahah!"
"Hey, let me get to the point!" *sniffle*

[Taichi]
"There, there. I'll listen. What about the god? What
kind of god is it?"

[Girl]
"Oh, Nanaca doesn't know that, either."

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

It struck me right then.

[Taichi]
"I've made a huge discovery! If you call yourself by
your own name, it's super cute!"

[Nanaca]
"I know that."

She said, not missing a beat.
Clearly she wasn't the type to be put off by
meaningless digression.

[Nanaca]
"Come with? There's a hokora shrine nearby."

[Taichi]
"Heehee, hokora rhymes with cholera. You know what
that means?"

[Nanaca]
"Enough. Come on, now."

Guess I had no other choice but to accompany her to
the shrine...

[Taichi]
"On the side of the trail?"

[Nanaca]
"Right, exactly."
"Whoops!"

She popped another wheelie, and this time hopped on
her back tire.
It was completely unconnected to the conversation,
but it was a hell of a trick.

[Taichi]
"Unbelicious!"
*Unbelievable+Delicious.

[Nanaca]
"Right?"

She smiled, proud.
Just between us, but I kind of fell for her.

[Nanaca]
"The god of the hokora shrine is totes
amazalicious."
"They say his grace will even protect us if there's
a nuclear war."

[Taichi]
"A dirty lie."
"No matter how good your cancer insurance is,
if cancer really goes for it, you're done for."

[Nanaca]
"Um, you're missing the point."

[Taichi]
"This is the 21st century. God should try
specializing for the modern age."
"Like, if your girlfriend has an affair with a
better-looking guy, God should leak it to you by
email or something."

[Nanaca]
"When society considers that upholding people's
right to privacy, that's how you know it's the
beginning of the end."

[Taichi]
"Japan is slowly going crazy."

[Nanaca]
"Dig it!"

This time she went up on her front wheel.
It took me by surprise.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, that bike is amazing!"

[Nanaca]
"Oh, the bike is, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Let me try!"

[Nanaca]
"No way. This is not for amateurs."

[Taichi]
"Meanie."

[Nanaca]
"One time my dad hopped on without asking."
"And then he flipped it and brought it back all
scratched up."
"We had such a huge fight."
"When I asked him about the scratches, he pretended
to not know anything."

[Taichi]
"I mean, it must have been tough for him, too..."

[Nanaca]
"I told Mom."

[Taichi]
"You monster!"

[Nanaca]
"I had her cut his pocket money for three months!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, a simple sentimental course of events, evoking
the national familial archetypes."

[Nanaca]
"Back then, he tried playing a computer prank on his
coworker, too. He put an automated program on it.
The kind that fills their public folder with filth."

He sounded like real manboy.

[Nanaca]
"But he made a mistake, and ended up filling his
boss's computer with obscenities!"

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahaha!"

[Nanaca]
"Ahahahaha!"

Her parents were idiots!

[Nanaca]
"He got a pay cut for three months! Ah, I had a good
laugh with Mom!"

[Taichi]
"If all families were like yours, the world would be a
better place."

[Nanaca]
"Well, they're gone now..."

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

*gulp*
She did another wheelie on her bike.
Oh, I got another peek at her panties...
A second glance!

[Nanaca]
"Awhoops!"

Another look! Ah! Aaah!!
Aaah!
Pure-white-pure-white-pure-white panties!!
Cameltoe-cameltoe-cameltoe!!
What a sight!!

[Taichi]
"Ooh..."

I fell to my knees.

[Nanaca]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"I think my intelligence dropped a little too far
just now..."

[Nanaca]
"Uhhh... So, your level of intelligence isn't a
constant, is what you're trying to say?"

[Taichi]
"Does it feel good on that saddle?"

[Nanaca]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing...forget it."

I finally came back to my senses.
I'm just so weak when it comes to unexpected
eroticism.
I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Right, off to school."

[Nanaca]
"Why are you slouching forward like that?"

[Taichi]
"How can you ask such a question in that innocent,
girlish tone?"

[Nanaca]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"Let's just say I'm, uh, experiencing issues in
my...lower extremities."

[Nanaca]
"You hurt your lower back!"

[Taichi]
"You gotta be kidding me..."

[Nanaca]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, I mean, y-you got me. My...lower back just
hurts."

[Nanaca]
"Right."

Okay, that threw her off the scent.

[Nanaca]
"Do take care! I worry for your progeny."

[Taichi]
"Oh, I can't wait to produce some, heheh!"

[Nanaca]
"You truly are shockingly frank with your lust."

[Taichi]
"The truth comes out when I'm taken unawares."

Okay, that remark I wasn't proud of.

[Taichi]
"Any man, when presented with a lovely young lady,
feels the turgid rise of lust, and then it's all
'arise, red snake!'"
"You know 'arise, red snake,' right?"
"But don't worry, normally it's more 'at ease, blue
snake,' with me."

[Nanaca]
"Are yellow snakes somewhere in the middle?"

[Taichi]
"Right, a 'semi,' we call it..."

At that point I became a bit unsure of myself.
I turned around nervously.

[Taichi]
"Wait, what am I even saying... Did I go too far?"

Nanaca grinned.

[Nanaca]
"No, it made me happy."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaca]
"Come on, walk, walk!"
"I'll walk behind you until your excited little
friend goes beddy-bye."

[Taichi]
"What?! So, you knew all along..."

That scratched my ego up. Sort of like how Sakuraba
was full of scratches after his accident, heh.

[Nanaca]
"Hey, there's that big school!"
"It's so shiny and so new. Must have cost a
fortune."

[Taichi]
"You want to transfer in?"
"There's a special going on right now, start today
without an entrance exam!"

[Nanaca]
"What about my uniform?"

[Taichi]
"I-I'll get one readyyy..."

[Nanaca]
"One with the chest cut out, right?"

[Taichi]
"Wh-what do you take me for?! A savage?!"
"It's just, we only have one with the skirt about
three centimeters shorter than usual. If that's
still o-okay..."

[Nanaca]
"You're trying too hard..."
"Anyway, it's about time for me to get going."

Her bicycle spun around. In place.
Her fine motor skills were really something.

[Nanaca]
"Listen, boy. All that talk about the hokora on the
mountain? It was true."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

It took me a while to figure out what she meant.

[Nanaca]
"If you ever get to where you can't go any further,
go and see."

[Taichi]
"R-right..."

Her expression soured.

[Nanaca]
"I guess it won't make any difference anyway,
no matter what I say."

[Taichi]
"Nanaca..."

[Nanaca]
"Oops, I'm starting to sound super weird. Sometimes
I need to watch what I say."

She popped a wheelie and spun around in place.
When she came back around to face me, she had a big
smile on her face.

[Nanaca]
"Buh-byeee!"

She waved her hand majestically.
Her toes touched the pedals.

[Taichi]
"Hey, one question!"

I called to her departing back.

[Nanaca]
"Yeees?"

[Taichi]
"How did you know my name, by the way? We just
met...now that I think about it."

[Nanaca]
"The only one who can answer that is..."

She pointed a finger at me.
No, at something behind me.
I turned around, and stared at the school for a few
seconds.
Nothing was said.
I turned back towards Nanaca.
But she was gone.
Along with her bike.
Guess I'd just have to live without an answer to my
question.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

The new school term was off to a quiet start, with
not even a cicada singing.
