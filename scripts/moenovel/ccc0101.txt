Should I give in?
Death? Me?
I could hardly believe it.
I didn't think I could accept death.
My instinct to survive was strong.
I should be tenacious as a desert insect.
Besides, I wasn't sure how much hatred Kiri had
towards me.
I suddenly got angry.
I had to be alive.
There was only despair left in me.
I had to keep going and smile.

[Taichi]
"Kiri... Stop."

One step forward.

[Taichi]
"This isn't the time to be killing each other, is
it?"

Another step forward.

[Taichi]
"I know you hate me. But that doesn't mean we have
to kill each other."

Another.

[Taichi]
"This is nonsense!"

And another.

[Taichi]
"And this doesn't benefit either of us. You're in
danger, too."

If Youko was watching...
Kiri could be dead in the next second.
But how can I explain?
Explain how scary she was?
I got flustered.
I took one too many steps.

[Taichi]
"About Yutaka..."

[Kiri]
"...!!"

A light sound whistled through the air.
Just then, almost comically, a black arrow hit me
right in the chest.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

My mistake.
From the shock of being shot, I collapsed to the
ground.
There was no pain.
No pain at all.
I didn't even feel that I was close to death.
Man...she got me. Is this going to hurt later?
I slowly fell over.
I fell inside a pile of desks.
I lost sight of Kiri.

[Taichi]
*huff huff huff*

Shallow breathing.
Still not dead?
I felt an extreme anguish coming on.
Yeah, this is going to suck...
I now know that an instant death is a happy death.

[Taichi]
"Hah hah hah...hah..."

I realized that my breathing was becoming
dangerously shallow.
I began to lose consciousness.
I heard Kiri scream.
There was the sound of glass breaking.
Although I couldn't see it, I felt something bite
into my flesh.

[Taichi]
*huff huff*

I suddenly stopped breathing.
Everything went dark as if my eyes were covered in
mud.
And in my final moments...

[Youko]
"...!"

I saw her.
