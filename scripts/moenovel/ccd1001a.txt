I pushed open the door.
And was met by resistance.
Could it have been being pushed from the other side?
I pushed even harder.
There was definitely something on the other side.
Turns out it was wind.
I then noticed the antenna.
It was finally starting to take shape.
Its directivity and wavelengths still needed some
adjustments.
But, I didn't have that knowledge.
Mimi didn't know the specifics either,
but she studied it.
But that Mimi was now...gone.
Tools.
Stepladder.
Books.
Sweet-roll wrappers flew around in the wind.
There were only traces of work left.
Not that it was being worked on 24/7, but...
I looked up at the antenna.
It was tall and out in the open.
An ideal environment to send radio waves.
There was a local radio broadcast called
Community FM.
Originally, it hadn't been created with club
activities in mind.
But...
It was created with good intentions by local
volunteers when Gunjo was coming around.
Which relates to this story.
The preparations were moving forward but became
hazy when a certain unavoidable incident occurred.
And the purchased antenna was neglected for a year.
That was the back story.
People expected inspirational content from the boys
and girls of Gunjo FM about hopes and dreams, but...
Unfortunately that wasn't going to happen at Gunjo.
Either way, it all somehow worked out in the end.
Mimi had set up SOS plans.
That's what she said Sunday night.
That was after we split up to make sure that mankind
had really vanished.
The antenna seemed functional, but completing and
sending transmissions still seemed far from actually
happening.
Honestly, I thought Mimi got frayed.
Fleeing gradually makes people weaker.
And Mimi was already weak to begin with.

[Misato]
"Pekke?"

I heard a voice from behind me.
I turned around.

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, Mimi."

[Misato]
"Hey hey to you too. Umm...what's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"I wanted to see how you were doing."

Mimi smiled softly.

[Misato]
"Is that so."

[Taichi]
"I haven't been here in a while. I can see
you've made a lot of progress."

[Misato]
"I've been working on it for a while now, so..."

That's right.
Ever since the broadcasting club fizzled out...
Mimi had been doing this all by herself.
Lunchtime DJ.
Making announcements.
Everything.
Everyone else had stopped helping.
Kiri saw me as an enemy...
Tomoki started avoiding his sister...
Miki nervously smiled...
And Touko started ignoring me...
It all fizzled out.
Sakuraba was the only one who didn't change.
He skipped classes, like usual.
I still hung around Mimi, but...
She always declined help.

[Taichi]
"That's right..."

[Misato]
"At any rate, what a surprise."

[Taichi]
"Really is."

[Misato]
"People just vanished all at once."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, and it's so quiet now."

[Misato]
"Very very quiet."

[Taichi]
"Where were you at?"

[Misato]
"Well... I got a little hungry."

[Taichi]
"It's lunchtime. Were you able to find any food?"

[Misato]
"Ah, I went back home. I was free to eat whatever I
wanted."

[Taichi]
"Oooh, you were skipping. So the club president was
skipping."

[Misato]
"N-no, this doesn't count as skipping."

She stumbled.
She was the type to follow rules.

[Taichi]
"Suspended, you're gonna get suspended."

[Misato]
"I don't wanna be suspended, it'll show up in my
career history."

[Taichi]
"Suspended! Suspended!"

[Misato]
"Nope, can't get suspended."

We frolicked together.
For now, that was the closest we'd be.
What did contact with her lead to?
I knew all too well.
Personal experience...and records.
I needed to proceed with caution.
I approached her.
My hand grazed her.
And...
She was asleep.
I knew it.

[Misato]
"..."

She was breathing lightly and regularly.
I watched her for a bit.
Her eyes finally started to open.

[Misato]
"H-huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"K-Kurosu?"

[Taichi]
"That's Pekke."

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She repeated the name. Her name just for me.

[Misato]
"How long have you been here?
I'm embarrassed..."

She hid her face.

[Taichi]
"I just showed up."
"Never mind that though. Sleeping here is
dangerous."

[Misato]
"Ah, yeah. Don't worry though. I'm fine."

I helped her up.

[Taichi]
"I'm just telling you not to sleep like this."
"And don't let your glasses slide off."

I repositioned her glasses.

[Misato]
*sigh*

[Taichi]
"There we go, back to the usual Misato."

At least in her appearance.

[Taichi]
"Are you awake now?"

[Misato]
"Mmm... But I'm sleepy..."

[Taichi]
"Fine, but you know I can see your panties,
right?"

It was a lie, unfortunately.

[Misato]
"Wh-wha...!"

That woke her up.
That's a lady for ya.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"G-good morning... Ugh, my head hurts..."

[Taichi]
"Because you were sleeping under the sun.
That can kill you, you know."

[Misato]
"Well, it didn't."

[Taichi]
"Your determination is inspiring."
"But it's dangerous, so at least let me keep an eye
on you from now on."

[Misato]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"I'll be a part of the club...not your escape."

[Misato]
"Club hours are overrrrr!"

[Taichi]
"Clubs hours are beginningggg!"

[Misato]
"But they just finished..."

[Taichi]
"I only show up every now and then to hang out."

[Misato]
"Whaaat?"

[Taichi]
"Okay then, see you tomorrow."

[Misato]
"Yep, tomorrow."

I left the building, and looked up at the rooftop.
The antenna was up.
And next to it...
I could see Misato, still there.
She was working.
Even though it was almost night.
She was there all alone.
Back when I thought staying away
was the only way to go...
That's when I met her.

[Misato]
"Hello there!"

[Taichi]
"...?"

[Misato]
"You're always alone, aren't you?"
"My name is Misato Miyasumi."
"Why don't we do club together?"

I'll never forget those words.
The first other person.
The first anyone.
I woke up that day.
Sun beams had been piercing through my window.
I must have really been out of it. I didn't have a
single dream that time.
It was seven o'clock.
Time for school.
I'd walked this path with Yusa before.

[Yusa]
"Huh? Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Yusa]
"Oh, good morning."

Yusa...
She was my friend at the time.
Now Mimi was asleep.
I picked up the alarm clock.
It was set for 12 am.
So was she working into the night or something?
Did she just keep going until she got sleepy?
Must be tough for her.
I adjusted the time on the alarm clock.

[Misato]
"Mmm... Mmm..."

She jumped to her feet.

[Taichi]
"What are you doing asleep this time of day?"

[Misato]
"I wasn't sleeping."

[Taichi]
"Yes, you were."

[Misato]
"Uggggh."

[Taichi]
"And that's why I said you were."

[Misato]
"Ahhh... Unnnh."

She tottered around a bit.

[Misato]
"Anyway, good morning."

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Misato."
"Won't you get sick from sun exposure, sleeping
here?"

[Misato]
"Oh, yeah, but I'm being careful."

She lifted the edge of her skirt to wipe her
glasses.
I averted my eyes.
Gentleman. You're a gentleman.

[Misato]
"Sweepy..."

She tried to stop a yawn as she wiped her glasses.

[Misato]
"Ugh... I feel sluggish..."

[Taichi]
"Right?"

[Misato]
"What time is it?"

[Taichi]
"It's around eight."

She stretched out silently.
Then folded her two hands into a pillow.

[Taichi]
"Didn't I just say not to fall asleep here..."
"Mind if I have my way with you then?"

[Misato]
*zzz*

I put her on my back.
She showed no sign of even the slightest willingness
to walk.
The nurse's office was empty.
I laid her down on the bed.

[Taichi]
"Good night, Misato. Sweet dreams."

I picked up from where she left off with the
antenna.
A long, normal life had endowed me with
technological prowess and knowledge.
I reorganized the system to make it more
efficient.
I didn't mind working up a sweat. It was nice.
My body went into autopilot mode, and I thought back
on a memory.
I tried to relive how I felt in the past with the
rooftop as my stage.
Avoiding the guards had become routine.
Once again, I'd found myself on the rooftop during
lunch.
Though I'd worried they'd find me there, the rooftop
somehow never registered on their radar.
I just stared at the sky until lunch was over.
Nobody could disturb the peace I'd found.
But that also meant I couldn't connect
with anyone.
Not a huge problem, if you ask me.
I'd been too focused on living with others to think
about having fun.
I was fully aware that I was like a ticking time
bomb.
Social interaction came at a huge cost for me.
Feeling the need to pay had kept me constantly
stressed.
All I got was the solidarity that was part of the
process... There was no happy ending.
Naturally, it was all more trouble than it was worth.
Now, I had little choice.
Isolation was the norm.
Was there anything I could do outside of numbing my
own heart?

[Misato]
"We meet again, Kurosu."

She was the one who got the ball rolling.

[Taichi]
"..."

I think I was confused.
I had never come into contact with anyone like that
before.
She had big breasts.
And glasses.
I normally struggled with actual girls, but I
couldn't say I hated her or anything.
She smiled as she waited for a response.
She appeared to have no intention of leaving.
I gave off a "leave me alone" kind of vibe.

[Misato]
"?"

But she didn't seem to get it.

[Taichi]
"How do you know my name?"

I responded without thinking. My loss.

[Misato]
"Ahah, so that's how your voice sounds."

She clapped and her smile widened.

[Taichi]
"How do you know my name?"

I cut interjected again with my question.

[Misato]
"The register of names."

The register, she said.
Was it that easy to get a hold of?
Was the school even allowed to show it?
The cynicism grew strong in me.

[Taichi]
"So I guess we're playing detective. Am I the one
who did it?"
"Is this what they teach in high school?"

I had a lot of faith in my cynicism.

[Misato]
"Ouch. That stings."
"But I do owe you an apology."

Well if that wasn't an ironic response...

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"I should introduce myself first."
"I'm in the broadcast club."

[Taichi]
"I know that."
"I've heard you on the lunch broadcasts."

Though I wish I hadn't.

[Misato]
"Ah, I see. Yeah, that's me. I'm the lunch DJ."

[Taichi]
"I wouldn't go so far as to say you're good at it."

[Misato]
"I'm bad it... That's what you mean..."

She looked disappointed.

[Taichi]
"If you know that you're bad, you should quit while
you're ahead."

I didn't talk to people often, so that probably
sounded meaner than I intended.

[Misato]
"We've been undermanned forever now."

She raised on of her palms toward me.

[Misato]
"And that's why I want to bring you into the fold."

[Taichi]
"..."
"Hmph..."

I failed my attempt to laugh nihilistically
and my face twitched as if shocked.
It sucked...
I wiped the expression off my face and spoke.

[Taichi]
"Sorry. Please ask someone else."

I walked away.

[Misato]
"Ohh, wait! Stop!"

...
And that's how she managed to get me involved.
And now...
I was the one being rejected.
Wednesday came.
I began making my way to school.
Our school's gate was there to prevent escape.
It didn't protect the students. It protected the
outside world from us.
That was the impression you got.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

Misato greeted me with suspicion.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Club President."
"Your head isn't throbbing in pain?"

[Misato]
"It is. Ouch."
"I-I mean, I'm fine. It's just that I get this
nagging feeling that work on the antenna
went on while I slept in the nurse's room."

[Taichi]
"That was my doing."

[Misato]
"You?"

[Taichi]
"Well, you told me to..."

[Misato]
"Huh? I did?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. You don't remember?"

[Misato]
"Hmm..."

She looked troubled.
I wasn't content to stop there.

[Taichi]
"I just didn't know what else to do when you started
dancing naked."

[Misato]
"Hn?!"

Her eyes seemed to form a horizontal X.

[Misato]
"Ahhhh!"
"I don't believe you! I'd never do that!"

[Taichi]
"It went like this..."

[Misato]
"I'm hot! So hot! Oh, these clothes just all have
to go!"

She loosened her necktie with her left hand
and had her right hand in there helping
in 0.62 seconds flat.
The two hands were too much for the necktie, which
came loose from her 32 centimeter neck.
Next, her right hand unbuttoned two buttons
in two seconds flat, exposing her breasts.

[Misato]
"Uh, that's...that's..."

Both hands undid the strings at the shoulders, and
then her right hand undid the blouse and the left
hand undid the skirt.
The blouse went at 4.28 seconds and the skirt at
7.34 seconds.
Only her underwear remained.
Her bra hook unhooked easily.
She cupped her breasts, and the cloth danced in the
air before falling to the ground.

[Misato]
"Somebody! Anybody! Look at me! Check out my totally
naked body!"

She extended both arms, turned to her left
in a mere second, and moved 6.53 meters.

[Misato]
"Laaa! La-la-la-la-laaaaa! La-la-la-la-laaaaa!"

I watched over her and her beautiful figure.
-The End-

[Misato]
*sniff sniff*
"I told you not to look, and you looked anyway."

She slumped into her seat and wept.

[Taichi]
"I'm just paying you back."

[Misato]
"But if you're able to describe it that precisely,
it means that it must be true!"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

She broke into tears.

[Taichi]
"But, relax. I took care of it, so no one
would see you."

[Misato]
"You did...? Well...then, thank you."

[Taichi]
"Don't mention it."
"I also made the script you asked for."

[Misato]
"Huh? Did I ask you to do that?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. Have a look."

The content made good use of the past.

[Misato]
"Hmm... This is pretty good."

She lifted her head, revealing a smile.

[Misato]
"It's so like us."

[Taichi]
"So it gets your seal of approval then."

We both laughed...a little...
Her face turned gloomy.

[Misato]
"In the end, solitude gets you nowhere, huh."

[Taichi]
"Don't you think you were overdoing it?"
"You can't just kill yourself working on it
day and night. I forbid it."

[Misato]
"Ugh... The boss shouldn't have to be lectured..."

The materials she leaned against moved
as she stood up.
They slid toward her.

[Taichi]
"Watch out!"

[Misato]
"Huh?"

Step-ladders, nails, tools, everything...
They all came crashing down to the floor in a
clattered dissonance.

[Misato]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"Be careful..."

[Misato]
"Oh... Th-thanks..."

[Taichi]
"Let's stay like this a little longer..."

[Misato]
"Umm, sure, but..."

[Taichi]
"It's still dangerous if we don't stay like this."

[Misato]
"I wonder..."

Her scent.
I could almost smell the memories
of the first summer.

[Misato]
"Good evening."

I'd felt a chill on my neck as I dozed off.

[Taichi]
"Whoa! What's going on?"

[Misato]
"It's juice time."

She dangled two cans of juice in front of me.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"My treat."

[Taichi]
"..."

I took one.

[Taichi]
"You're stubborn, too, huh."
"You probably shouldn't spend too much time with
me."

[Misato]
"Why not?"

She sat next to me.

[Taichi]
"Because I'm a pathetic loser."
"You should be careful. Sometimes I just want to
hurt people."
"I'm a very dangerous individual."

[Misato]
"Well... This is getting dark..."

I'm sure she knew it when she saw the registry.
My name was there, framed in red.

[Taichi]
"Club activities? I doubt they'd let me join."
"I'm sure you get what I mean. You know this place..."

[Misato]
"I do. And that's why I'm talking to you."

[Taichi]
"There's a lot you can't learn from conversation."

[Misato]
"One thing I have learned..."

She raised a finger, her face serious.

[Taichi]
"Is...?"

[Misato]
"That you...have a complex towards anything
ordinary."

[Taichi]
"Er..."

She was right. What astounding insight.
Was it her age?
What manner of thinking would allow me to object?
I shuddered.

[Misato]
"So that's how your face responds."

My face, huh?
I relaxed.

[Misato]
"I just want you to be healthy."
"You and me both."

She showed me the scars on her wrists.
They seemed old and were slightly faded.

[Taichi]
"What's this?"

[Misato]
"The symptoms of self-harm."
"Careful preparation is needed to kill yourself with
cutting."
"But I always do it when I'm stressed out."
"For me, stress is...how can I put this? It's things
that aren't in order."
"Like a cluttered room, or rules that aren't obeyed."

[Taichi]
"That's rough."
"But isn't it the same all over the world?"

[Misato]
"I suppose you're right. The world is nothing but
stressors."
"I just feel like I have to hurt myself when I feel
trapped..."
"Sometimes I even hurt others."
"That's the dilemma I'm in."

[Taichi]
"I'm different."
"I..."

She hugged me gently.

[Taichi]
"W-wait..."

[Misato]
"It's fine. We don't have to talk if it hurts."
"Anyway, the point is that I'm no good."
"But I'm trying to get better."

[Taichi]
"You..."

[Misato]
"Passing waves, thrilling friendships, various
occurrences, and compromise... Wanna give it a go
with me?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"The Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club has openings
for students with zero self-confidence."

[Taichi]
"That's practically a religious solicitation."

[Misato]
"Maybe we should treat it like a religion!"

[Taichi]
"You're weird."

[Misato]
"Hey!"

[Taichi]
"Oww..."

A head-butt.

[Misato]
"I'm your superior."
"And that juice came out of club funds."

[Taichi]
"You're mean..."

[Misato]
"Now you have to come take a look at our club
activity. That is your duty."

[Taichi]
"You tricked me good..."

[Misato]
"We lack members, and despite being a first-year
student, I still have to run around like a chicken
with its head cut off."

[Taichi]
"At least you've got a chest. Isn't that enough?"

[Misato]
"Oh, are you already into that sort of thing?"

[Taichi]
"Well, I am male."

[Misato]
"My little brother still acts like a child."

She was totally defenseless.
Too defenseless.

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

I laughed.

[Taichi]
"I'll join."

[Misato]
"Oh?"

[Taichi]
"I'll join the club..."

[Misato]
"What, really? You will?"

[Taichi]
"It beats being slowly tortured to death with this
chesty hug of yours."

[Misato]
"Whoa! I did it! This is great!"

You did it, huh...

[Taichi]
"It's the opposite."
"It's the opposite of back then."

[Misato]
"Back then?"

[Taichi]
"Have you already forgotten?"

[Misato]
"Oh...that's what you meant."

She didn't hesitate as she pushed her body
into my chest.
None of the old innocence remained.
As she held me, I fidgeted in confusion.
Because she was thinking of me as a member of the
opposite sex.
My pulse quickened.

[Misato]
"I got the feeling there was something there."

[Taichi]
"I was retaliating because of the surprise hug."

[Misato]
"I mean... Well, I thought it was because you were
just a kid."

[Taichi]
"You'll get hurt if you're not careful."

[Misato]
"Hurting myself is okay..."
"It's better than hurting others."

[Taichi]
"How do people like you hurt others?"

[Misato]
"It's possible..."

Her voice hoarse, she rubbed her brow.
Right now...
This girl who was my senior...
Was acting like an innocent little girl.

[Misato]
"Umm..."

[Taichi]
"Oh...?"

[Misato]
"Why am I being cared for even though I'm not hurt?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe you have a scratch somewhere?"

[Misato]
"Do I...?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it doesn't matter. You look tired.
You should get some rest."

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"Here's your phone."

[Misato]
"Oh, thanks."

[Taichi]
"You still carry it even though it's useless."

[Misato]
"I feel uneasy without it."
"With it, I can go to them as soon as a call
comes in."

[Taichi]
"A call...?"

[Misato]
"From my family."

[Taichi]
"Your family..."

[Misato]
"In prison..."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"They're criminals..."

[Taichi]
"Th-This is the first I've heard of this."

[Misato]
"They went down on tax evasion for embezzling
money."

Sounded like quite the colorful past.

[Taichi]
"I have to be careful not to become a sex offender."

[Misato]
"Not funny..."

[Taichi]
"Y-yeah..."

[Misato]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Get some sleep."

[Misato]
"Whaaaa? You're totally going to molest me, aren't
you?"

[Taichi]
"How rude. I wouldn't do that."

For now...

[Taichi]
"You can live in peace."

I closed her eyes with the palm of my hand.
I walked into the hallway...
And started looking for Tomoki.
I was able to find him before long.
So I called out to him.

[Tomoki]
"Oh, it's you, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"You worried about her?"

[Tomoki]
"Huh? No, nothing like that. Just wondering what
was up."
"I mean, it's none of my business. And our parents
just divorced."
"We're living with separate parents."

Separate parents?
So the four of them split into halves?

[Taichi]
"I see. So which did you end up with?"

[Tomoki]
"My mom..."

[Taichi]
"So she's with your father?"

[Tomoki]
"Well..."
"Anyway, is there anything going on
with you two?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Club activities."

[Tomoki]
"Why...?"

[Taichi]
"I mean, it's nice to work towards something, right?"

[Tomoki]
"You mean the same pointless stuff as usual?"

[Taichi]
"I don't think it's pointless."

[Tomoki]
"If you're still sticking with it, then... I mean,
you must have your reasons."
"So who else is in the club?"

[Taichi]
"The club president."

[Tomoki]
"That's it?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Tomoki]
"That doesn't sound much like a club..."

[Taichi]
"I could just be jerking off all day and it's still
a club if I treat it like it is."

[Tomoki]
"I know you've been all over the place lately, but
you never told me it was because of club."

I shrugged indifferently.

[Taichi]
"How is your relationship?"

[Tomoki]
"I tend to keep that to myself."
"Sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Yup."

[Tomoki]
"She'll turn on you, you know."

He said it with disdain.

[Taichi]
"That's fine. I don't care."

[Tomoki]
"Mm-hm..."

[Taichi]
"Is zero betrayal required for trust?"

[Tomoki]
"Well..."

[Taichi]
"It's not like I'm any better."

[Tomoki]
"You haven't turned on her, have you?"

[Taichi]
"No, nothing like that. But I've betrayed many in
the past and will likely do it again."

[Tomoki]
"That's not as funny as your usual jokes."

It wasn't meant to be.

[Taichi]
"Do you think jokes like those grow on trees?"

I just try to say as much as I can.

[Tomoki]
"Anyway, I wouldn't get too close to her if I were
you. I'm saying this for your sake."

[Taichi]
"No, I will. It's going to go where it's going
to go."

He turned pale.

[Tomoki]
"Wh-what...does that mean...?"

[Taichi]
"I'm going for the goal."

[Tomoki]
"The goal?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing but net."

[Tomoki]
"Ngh..."

He was shocked.

[Tomoki]
"But...but..."

[Taichi]
"The immoral stems from over-thinking."

I tapped him on the shoulder.

[Tomoki]
"It's me, Tomoki!"

[Taichi]
"Settle on a purer immorality. I'm saying this for
your sake."

[Tomoki]
"I understand like 5\p of this."

[Taichi]
"Passing waves, thrilling friendships, various
occurrences, and compromise... Wanna give it a go
with me?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"The Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club has openings for
boys crazy about your sister."

I just had to use her words.
Thought Tomoki might appreciate them.

[Tomoki]
"Umm..."

All right, Tomoki should be here soon.
I waited in the entrance hall.

[Tomoki]
"Tai-"

[Taichi]
"You're here. Thanks for the food."

[Tomoki]
"Whoa, look at that... You're wearing a kimono."

[Taichi]
"Got that literary master look down, right?"

[Tomoki]
"Do you always dress like that?"

[Taichi]
"Of course."

[Tomoki]
"That's pretty cool."

Tomoki was being much more respectful
than I expected.

[Taichi]
"Passing waves, thrilling friendships, various
occurrences, and compromise... Wanna give it a go
with me?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"The Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club has openings
for disobedient boys with sister complexes."

[Tomoki]
"That line...seemed to hit home in the passing waves
category..."

[Taichi]
"Well?"

[Tomoki]
"At Gunjo..."

[Taichi]
"Only 10 per class are buzzing with those waves."

[Tomoki]
"Aagghh..."

[Taichi]
"Or they did when they were around..."

[Tomoki]
"Aagghh..."

[Taichi]
"But anyway, thanks for the food."

[Tomoki]
"Friendship is..."

[Taichi]
"Not asking anything in return."

*thumbs-up*
We shared a big laugh, then gave each other a thumbs-up.
I think that was our quota for the day.

[Tomoki]
"Later."

[Taichi]
"Wanna come to club when things cool down?"

His face grew hard.

[Tomoki]
"I don't do club activities with traitors."

[Taichi]
"Coming!"
"Who is it?"

[Yusa]
"Er, um, it's Doujima."

[Taichi]
"Such a wicked-sounding name attached to such a cute
voice... Is that you, Yusa? It's open, come in!"

She timidly opened the door, to reveal a beautiful
young woman standing there.

[Yusa]
"G-good evening."

I gave her a seat and poured her some barley tea.
We had been chatting for a while, when...

[Yusa]
"Um, so today is my birthday."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, really?"

[Yusa]
"So here...a birthday present for you."

[Taichi]
"Ummm...well, thanks. But, uh...?"

[Yusa]
"Also, if you happened to finish going over our
exchange diaries..."

[Taichi]
"Well, here's the diary, and this is a birthday gift
from me."

[Yusa]
"..."

Yusa was the kind of girl who would get lost for
words when she was surprised.

[Taichi]
"Well then, I better walk you home."

[Yusa]
"?!"

She got even more lost for words at that.

[Taichi]
"It's nighttime, there might be creepers lying in
wait."

Especially around these parts.

[Taichi]
"Shall we?"

[Yusa]
"O-okay."

And so I walked with her.

[Yusa]
"You're always asking me that question, Taichi."
"I don't really know what you mean but...
all right."
"It's persistent!"

It was persistent.
Persistent.
Was it?
No.
Offensive.
Yes, offensive.
A violent assault.
Ah, yes.
I liked that word.
I laughed in my head.
Endlessly.
Ridiculed.
Sunken emotions were instantly swallowed
by the ravine.
The mental plate that guarded cynicism melted away,
and left only nothingness... It was like floating
unborn in the womb.
I had only one thought.
Enemies are enemies.
Kill or be killed.
But even that in mind, I wanted to kill...
