Hmm.
I made my way to the first-year classroom.
Maybe the Flowers would be there...
As it turned out, no one was here.
Their bags were on their desks.
They'd been here.
It seemed like they would still be in the school
somewhere.
Come to think of it, the school was halfway between
Kiri and Miki's houses.
The school was the ideal place for them to meet.
What to do...
I looked out the window.
I saw the pool.

[Taichi]
"Huuhh?"

Miki and Kiri were out there having fun.
I heard their faint voices.

[Miki]
"Take that!"

[Kiri]
"Waahh, My hair...!"

What a welcome sight.

[Kiri]
"Hey!"

My heart was unexpectedly soaring.
I held my chest to verify its warmth.
The heart of a human.
There was a heart in my chest, after all.
Though it may be smaller.

[Kiri]
"Aiiee!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah, you fell!"

[Kiri]
"I'm gonna dunk you!"

[Miki]
"No! My hair turns into seaweed when it's wet!"

[Kiri]
"Then I hope you like seaweed!"

The sound of water splashing.
Endless laughter.
It was a tender reminder of simpler times.
A glimpse of a simpler world.
I should write about this in the journal.
I didn't want to forget this feeling.
I watched them play for what seemed like ages.
I started to wonder if I should go mess with them...

[Taichi]
"I'd rather...just watch them."

It was good just being able to watch them.
Being able to see them just enjoying time with one
another.
This was the simple memory I wanted to keep.
