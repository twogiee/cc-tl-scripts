Impossible.
I couldn't accept death.
I certainly did loathe myself.
I hated everything about me.
I hated my ugly, greedy self.
I hated myself more than Kiri hated me.
But... If I was going to die then I would've done it
myself a long time ago.
I had to live.
If I didn't... What did I fight for all this time?
Even if that meant breaking Kiri...I had to live.

[Taichi]
"Just one question. Was it you who saw me on the
rooftop with Yutaka...?"

[Kiri]
"Yes, it was."
"I didn't care about it then...."
"But now...I understand."
"You cornered him... Just like you did to me in the
restroom."
"To fill your own need!"

[Taichi]
"How?"

[Kiri]
"Talked bad about his leg...and a lot of other
things."
"I don't really want to hear the details."
"Are you through?"

And still, her hands were shaky.
Looked like she was going to lose herself before
killing me.

[Taichi]
"Can I say one thing? It's going to be long though."

[Kiri]
"Go ahead..."

The way she said it.
It felt like she didn't want me to know, how she
felt inside.

[Taichi]
"...Can I sit?"

[Kiri]
"Go ahead."

[Taichi]
"Why don't you sit too?"

[Kiri]
"..."

Silence.
Oh well.
I started talking.

[Taichi]
"Hasekura had a home, a while back."
"A big house with a Western design. Ten times the
size of Touko's house."
"A multi-millionaire family's type of home."
"I lost my mom when I was young and they took me
in."
"I worked there while I stayed, for the husband and
wife who were distant relatives to my mom."
"It was a home with an old tradition."
"The subordinate kids were just that, subordinates."
"I was a kid, so my duty was to be playmates with
the other kids."
"Youko was their youngest daughter."
