It was Sunday.
We were all gathered on the roof.
Everything was ready.

[Taichi]
"You've worked hard on this, huh?"

[Misato]
"You too, Pekke."

Misato seemed a little dazed.
So, I kept us moving along.

[Taichi]
"But we're not really done."

[Misato]
"Oh, really?"

[Taichi]
"We'll have to keep this broadcasting station
maintained."

[Misato]
"..."
"Ah, yes, you're right."

[Taichi]
"Let's do our best from here on out!"

[Misato]
"Excuse me!"

We shook hands.
Misato gathered the tools and put them away, then
looked up at the antenna.

[Misato]
"It's really going to send out the signals, huh?"

[Taichi]
"It will."

[Misato]
"But broadcasting won't guarantee that everything's
gonna turn out all right."

That's also what I was thinking.
But it wasn't meaningless.
We had wanted to work.
Simply doing nothing would get us nowhere.
I was still in that boat...
But then, my reasons were a little different from
the others.

[Misato]
"Pekke, did you finish the script?"

[Taichi]
"Y-yeah, I guess so..."

Actually, I hadn't.
Misato grinned.

[Misato]
"Okay then, you be the DJ!"

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"We don't have time to mess around testing things or
running retakes."
"So, I'll just leave it to you."

[Taichi]
"R-right..."

It might have been for the best, actually.
Seeing as how the script was totally blank.
I couldn't find the right words.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi, can you help carry the equipment?"

[Taichi]
"Okey doke!"

Misato glanced at Mr. Late, Tomoki.

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

They looked away from each other.
Things between them didn't seem as nasty
as before.
For now, that would have to do.
I mean, going forward we were going to have to live
with each other.
We had all the time in the world. So much it made
me sick.
So we brought the equipment.
It would enable us to monitor things
from the roof.
Basically, our plan for the first broadcast was just
to describe how things were on the roof.

[Taichi]
"Rubber is conspicuously absent,
now of all times..."

[Tomoki]
"Like this is his first time..."

[Taichi]
"Heh, yeah. The big idiot."

[Sakuraba]
"Seriously!"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, Sakuraba! What are you doing here?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Friendship is..."

[Taichi]
"Not asking anything in return."

*thumbs-up*
We shared a big laugh, then gave each other a
thumbs-up.

[Tomoki]
"I don't think this is the time for that..."

[Taichi]
"It's been a while, Rubber!"

[Sakuraba]
"Yep."

[Touko]
"Ick, the three morons."

[Taichi]
"Hey."

Touko and the others had come.
The others.
Miki and Kiri were behind her.

[Miki]
"Gooood morning!"

Miki cried out, raising both hands above her head.
Kiri frowned and hunched her shoulders
at the noise.
That was the scene.
It felt surprisingly normal. Seven people just
coming together.
Even though normality should have been lost.

[Misato]
"Pekke, what is this?"

Misato tugged at my clothes.

[Taichi]
"Well, I made a deal..."

[Misato]
"You made... You did, Pekke?!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, I'm the super director, I handled it!"

[Misato]
"..."

She looked like she was going to cry.
She stood silent for a minute.
And then...

[Misato]
"Okay everyone, gather in."

[Taichi]
"Yes, boss!"

We gathered together.
I wondered if we'd ever have another meeting
like this.
Well, we'd just have to work hard to maintain this
solidarity!
As if.
There was no way.
Of course.
It was momentary...
A mere memory.

[Taichi]
"Excuse me!"

I raised my hand and called out to everyone.

[Taichi]
"In honor of this revival of the broadcast club, I
propose a raid on the bakery!"

[Tomoki]
"Why?!"

[Sakuraba]
"I had the same idea, and I am ready for a curry
roll!"

[Tomoki]
"Liar."

[Misato]
"Bakery? You mean that shop* the train nerd runs?
Could the seven of us take it?"
*Tazaki Mart

[Taichi]
"You aren't thinking it through seriously."

[Tomoki]
"But it really has been a while since we were all
together like this..."

[Touko]
"Why is everyone looking at me?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because you're the traitor who dropped all the club
activities."

[Taichi]
"You're one to talk!"

[Tomoki]
"You're one to talk!"

Our fists of ultimate savagery landed perfect
comedic (ultra-violent) thwacks in turn.
Sakuraba went down without a word.
For what it's worth, our roles in this routine were:
Sakuraba = The silly one
Tomoki = The level headed one
Taichi = All-around performer
That was us.

[Taichi]
"I am the one who softened her hard heart.
With the power of love!"

[Touko]
"Don't touch me!"

[Tomoki]
"She really hates you, you know that?"

[Taichi]
"But her body says yes!"

[Touko]
"I will end you!"

Her elbows rained blows upon my head, but I paid it
no mind.

[Miki]
"Kirihara!"

Miki grabbed Touko's ass.

[Touko]
"Whayaa?!"

Her scream climbed an octave.
Miki then started to massage it.

[Touko]
"Q-quit that, Yamanobe!"

[Miki]
"Soft... Oh, it's so soft!"

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, you really are gorgeous!"

Touko's head twitched.

[Touko]
"Let go! Don't touch me!"

[Miki]
"Oh, Kirihara..."

[Tomoki]
"Like some sexual assault gang..."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah."

[Touko]
"Don't just stand there watching,
do something!"

[Sakuraba]
"We can't interfere in civil cases."

[Touko]
"You're no cop!"

[Misato]
"Kirihara, I hope you're feeling better?"

[Touko]
"Why don't you try to do something about these
fools, before talking to me?!"

[Misato]
"Well, they're just acting on instinct, there's
really not much anyone can do..."

[Touko]
"How can you be so ca- Hey! Where do you think
you're touching?!"
"Agh... Stop! Just stop it!"

She started crying.

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

[Miki]
"Oh..."

We hurriedly backed off.

[Sakuraba]
*sniffle*

[Taichi]
"Why are you the one crying?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Because Kirihara's crying!"

[Miki]
"He's crying in sympathy."

[Sakuraba]
"It's just so painful!"

[Tomoki]
"Always the showman."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, I'm sorry, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"Are you...kidding me?"

She slapped me hard on the back with both hands.

[Taichi]
"Ouch!"

It hurt like a lash from a whip.
But I deserved it...

[Kiri]
*sigh*

Kiri looked away and sighed.

[Taichi]
"Here, have a candy."

[Touko]
"No."

I grabbed her chin and forced a candy into her
mouth.

[Touko]
"Hnnng?!"

[Taichi]
"Pretend you're at Grandma's house."

She tried to run, but I held onto her chin.

[Touko]
"Nng...hng...q-quit...it..."

[Taichi]
"One...two... Oh my, how many can fit in that cute
little hole?"

[Touko]
"Hnnng...nnmnnn...hnn..."

[Taichi]
"If you don't like it, just go ahead and bite my
finger off."

I saw a spark of hate kindle in her barely open
eyes.
But when I reached into her mouth and pulled on her
tongue, her eyes squeezed shut.
It seemed like Touko's mouth was overly sensitive.

[Taichi]
"Three...four... Heheheh, that's it..."

I crammed them further in.
Touko flailed her arms.

[Taichi]
"Heheh...aren't they sweet?"

Her resistance was weakening.
Indeed, she started to moan erotically, and sucked
them all in.

[Misato]
"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!"

[Miki]
"Dirty dirty S&M! Dirty dirty S&M...!"

[Tomoki]
"T-Taichi! That's a big no-no, it's so baaad!"
*child's voice*

[Kiri]
"I-I told you, he's dangerous... I did..."

[Sakuraba]
"From where I'm standing, he's just giving her a
little candy, that's all."

Everyone was trembling with voyeuristic passion.

[Taichi]
"Heheheh... Huh?"

I wanted to apologize, how'd it come to this?!

[Taichi]
"Oh, jeez, sorry, sorry!"

I let her go.
I pulled out my fingers, dripping with saliva.

[Touko]
"Hnn...nnn..."

Touko stumbled away from me.

[Taichi]
"Well, anyway, all that sugar should perk you
right up."

[Touko]
*gasp gasp*

She looked dazed for a moment, but soon came to her
senses and glared at me.
Her cheeks were puffed out like a squirrel's, all
full of candy.

[Touko]
"Stupid...stupid Taichi!"

[Miki]
"You can't really deny it..."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Kiri]
"Bunch of little kids."

[Misato]
"Okay, play time's over."

Misato clapped her hands.

[Touko]
"That wasn't play time, that was sexual assault!"

Everyone ignored her.

[Misato]
"Sakura and Kirihara."

She called on the prodigal pair.

[Kiri]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Since you're here and all, would you care to
join us?"

[Touko]
"..."

[Misato]
"It's not like our club activities are all that
hard, it's just watching things. At the very least,
it's a way to kill time."

Kiri and Touko.
They looked at each other for a moment.
They weren't exactly in the same place, rank-wise.

[Kiri]
"I'm..."
"I'm only here because Miki invited me."

[Misato]
"So you're not interested?"

[Miki]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"I'll help out until Miki's ready to go home."

[Miki]
"Heheh."

The mood lightened. For Miki, at least.
Kiri's face was frozen in a grimace.
The words worked their way through her candy-stuffed
mouth, one hand holding the sweets in.

[Touko]
"I'm only here because Hasekura asked me to come!"
"But...she's not even here."

She turned to go.
I grabbed her arm.

[Taichi]
"Well, about that..."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Well, I knew you'd never come if I used my own
name..."

[Touko]
"I'm going home."

[Taichi]
"Settle down, now..."

[Touko]
"I'd never have come if I knew it was you inviting
me!"

[Taichi]
"Don't get so mad!"

[Touko]
"You always manipulate people, just like that time!"
"You mock people and make them feel stupid,
you act like they're toys for your enjoyment!
But do you even once think about their feelings?!"
"You think because you don't get hurt that no one
else does. You cause so many problems!"

[Miki]
"Oh, a lospat!"
Miki Keyword: "Lospat" Refers to a lover's spat.

[Tomoki]
"Should we stop them?"

[Sakuraba]
"Bring on the sweets, Taichi."

[Misato]
"Oh, Sakuraba, that's so you..."

[Kiri]
"I think you're the only one who can stop them,
Misato."

[Misato]
"Oh...I guess so."
"Ummm..."
"Come on...now..."

[Touko]
"~I"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm pretty sure that derives 0."

[Misato]
"Ugh..."

It was no good. I had to handle it myself.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Touko."

[Touko]
"WHAT?!"

[Taichi]
"You know, I like your face when you're mad."

[Touko]
"WHATDIDYOUSAY?!"

[Taichi]
"I just mean, I hope we can keep fighting like this
forever."

[Touko]
"..."

Touko seemed to almost collapse.

[Touko]
"Oh, whatever. You make me so tired."

[Taichi]
"So, are you on board?"

[Touko]
"I said I was tired. Just, leave me alone."

[Taichi]
"Don't go."

[Touko]
"Do what you want."

I took that as a yes.
I led her by the hand over to the others.
Touko stared downward, not saying a word.

[Taichi]
"Well Misato, it does look like we brought back
a little normality somehow!"

[Misato]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Okay, everyone at ease, it's a patch job but we
appear to have repaired our relationship."

[Misato]
"R-right..."

She didn't appear totally satisfied.
I guess everybody had their own way of seeing
things.

[Misato]
"Well, for the first time in a while, we have a full
attendance."

[Taichi]
"Yes, sir!"

This old feeling, with all seven of us, was nice.
It was the starting point of our real club activity.

[Misato]
"Pekke, can I ask you to get everything ready?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, leave everything to me!"
"Oh, but first I need to hit the toilet. Got to
drain the main vein!"

[Touko]
"Just shut up and go, idiot."

[Taichi]
"Oh, pardon me!"

I'll let her have it again later.

[Sakuraba]
"Are you thinking of letting her have it again
later?"

[Taichi]
"N-not at all!"
"Phew."

I got my revenge by using the girls' toilet.
In particular, the stall Touko always used.

[Taichi]
"Heeheeh."

Proud of my victory, I proceeded to wash my hands.
I saw a girl's reflection in the mirror.
I froze.

[Taichi]
"Youko?"

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"So you're still coming to school. As elusive as
ever, I see."

[Youko]
"Are you having fun, playing club?"

I was surprised. I hadn't expected her to answer.

[Taichi]
"We're not playing, it's a real club activity."

[Youko]
"But it's pointless."

[Taichi]
"Nuh uh."
"It's really important. For me, and everyone else,
too."

She laughed.
It was true. Club activities were really important.

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I can't just sit around at home and do nothing."
"So did you just come here to express your cynicism?"

[Youko]
"I wasn't being cynical."

Her voice sounded miserable.

[Taichi]
"Look, you're even wearing your uniform."
"Why not come join us?"

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It's a real club, though. We're going to start
broadcasting in a while."

[Youko]
"You can't do anything with that stupid antenna."

[Taichi]
"It'll make us feel better."

[Youko]
"It's pointless."

[Taichi]
"There's a point to feeling better."

[Youko]
"I'll pass."

[Taichi]
"What if I begged you and grabbed on and wouldn't
let go?"

[Youko]
"I'd go."

Well, that was easy.

[Taichi]
*careful consideration*
"And what if I asked for the panties you're
wearing?"

She reached a hand under her skirt.

[Taichi]
"Um, yeah, never mind."

[Youko]
"..."

She stopped moving.
Was I some kind of evil puppet master?

[Taichi]
"Okay, just come and watch from a distance.
I know you hate other people."

[Youko]
"I don't hate them... I just don't care about them
at all."

She said, matter of factly.
But for her, this was a heartfelt conversation.
She usually only said what she absolutely had to.

[Taichi]
"But it is a big event, after all. Why not join in?"

[Youko]
"Mph..."

She left the restroom with the tiniest of nods.

[Taichi]
"Still..."

She had tracked me down even to the girl's restroom.
Quite resourceful of her.
Quite the ninja, indeed.
I left the restroom.

[Taichi]
"By the way, did you know that the root of 'woman'
is 'womb man,' from back when 'man' just meant
'person'?"

[Miki]
"First I've heard of it. Later."

We passed each other in front of the restroom.

[Taichi]
"Umm...let's keep me using the girls' toilet
just between us, okay?"

I begged her.

[Miki]
"Oh, well...whatever shall I do?"

[Taichi]
"Especially from Kirihara!"

[Miki]
"Well... Can I tell Kiri?"

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, no, not her!"

Those were the two foremost mean-girls in school!

[Miki]
"Then, I want some nata de coco!"

[Taichi]
"W-would agar jelly be okay?"

[Miki]
"Oh, I don't think that would keep my little lips
from flapping all over the place."

[Taichi]
"Oh, have mercy on this sinner!"

When I got back to the roof, everything was pretty
much ready.
I went to mess around with Sakuraba and Tomoki a bit
more, when...

[Misato]
"Okay, I think we can end the comedy trio routine,
it's time to get started!"

[Both]
"Okay..."

We reluctantly started moving.
Kiri stood a little further away, keeping an eye on
us.
Standing there alone without Miki, she seemed out of
place.

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

Kiri didn't react and just looked away.
Suddenly irritated, I stomped with my heel.
Well, well, well...

[Miki]
"I'm back!"

Miki was back.
She stood next to Kiri, completely natural.
These two...
Kiri thought she was the one looking out for Miki,
when in fact, Miki was the one in charge.
Or at least, that's how the power relationship
looked from the outside. Actually, maybe it was the
opposite.
It was all just a way to show their support for
each other.
It got my heart all aflutter.
But at the moment, I had to concentrate on the
broadcast.
And my script was still just a rough draft.
Hey, I didn't see Youko anywhere, either.
She should have been around. She had said she was
coming.
Searching...
Six sources of movement discovered within a 20 meter
radius.
But beyond that, there was a faint disturbance.
The water tower.

[Taichi]
"Found her."

Just as I'd suspected, she was hiding on top of the
tower.
I saw a small shadow moving faintly.
It must be her.
She was moving just the tiniest bit.
But I could sense the slightest of motion.
I had developed the sharpest senses in this dull
little world.

[Taichi]
"She really isn't interested, huh."

[Tomoki]
"What? Whazzat?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, I wasn't talking to you."
"Right, broadcast, broadcast..."

[Miki]
"So, do we have a name for the broadcast program?"

[Misato]
"Uhm, we haven't decided on anything yet."

[Sakuraba]
"Excuse me!"

[Misato]
"Yes, Sakuraba?"

[Sakuraba]
"Dreadful Hell Broadcasting!"

[Misato]
"Yah!"

*kathunk*
Our fearless club leader's punch dropped Sakuraba
in one hit.

[Misato]
"Rejected. Anyone else?"

[Sakuraba]
"That hurt!"

[Tomoki]
"You really are an idiot."

[Sakuraba]
"But hey, we do need a name with impact."

[Taichi]
"Okay, so you want to hear my kickass idea?"

[Tomoki]
"Sure."

[Taichi]
"Super Ninja!"

[Misato]
"..."

[Miki]
"Sexual Harassment Bushido."

[Tomoki]
"Broadcast Club!"

It appeared that my suggestion had triggered a
downward spiral of worse and worse names.

[Taichi]
"Super Ninja!"

[Miki]
"Om-nom Broadcasting!"

Everyone there turned and gave Miki a businesslike,
obligatory thump.

[Miki]
"Ooow... Meanies."

[Misato]
"No more silliness."

[Miki]
"Sowwy."

Back to square one, then.

[Taichi]
"Super Ninja!"

[Tomoki]
"That's your big idea?"

[Sakuraba]
"What kind of ninja?"

[Taichi]
"Like all, really super, and, like, megafuturistic..."

I gestured madly while I explained.

[Taichi]
"He can, like, jump over a ten meter wall. And he
chops everything with his beloved sword
Kogarashimaru!"

[Tomoki]
"Does he kill the evil lord?"

How boringly cliched.

[Taichi]
"Ooh..."
"He kills all the local girls!"

[Tomoki]
"He's a psychopath!"

[Sakuraba]
"Psychopath..."

[Misato]
"Rejected."

[Tomoki]
"Dress it up a little."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmm...tough."

[Misato]
"Please, let's move away from all the negative
suggestions."

Misato called out through her megaphone (which she'd
had all along).

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."
"Mimimi's..."

[Misato]
"Take that!"

*kathunk*
She hit me.
It was a beautiful mid-level punch.

[Taichi]
"Ooof!"

[Misato]
"Let's avoid any more vulgarity, shall we?"

[Taichi]
*wheeze*

[Sakuraba]
"The Flowers should be the DJ."

[Taichi]
"Guwha?!"

[Miki]
"You'd have to ask Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Wait, that's... I mean..."

[Sakuraba]
"We should definitely have the ladies do it."

[Taichi]
"Ooh..."

I already knew.
Oh, such regret.

[Miki]
"Okay then!"

She ran off.

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

She came back.

[Miki]
"She said, 'Tell me when those porgy-looking punks
have stopped talking their crap.'"

[Sakuraba]
"Sheesh... She's always so harsh."

Sakuraba had a stupid, happy grin on his face.
He really was a masochist.

[Taichi]
"What's a porgy?"

[Misato]
"A black porgy, it's a fish. Like a sea bream with a
weird face."

[Sakuraba]
"What kind of weird face?"

[Misato]
"Like this."

[Taichi]
"Oh, Kiri, you had better be careful..."

[Kiri]
"Hmph..."

[Taichi]
"Oh, that little bi-."

[Tomoki]
"Settle down, now..."

[Sakuraba]
"So hey, I'm getting kind of tired of all this."

[Misato]
"You're a nice one to talk!"

We were all getting a little war-weary.
This is just how all us little misfits get along.

[Taichi]
"Oh, hey, what's your opinion, Kirihara?"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"You are, after all, a member.
Say something, missy."

[Touko]
"Hm."

She snorted through her nose in irritation.

[Touko]
"The Morons."

[Sakuraba]
"Villain! As if coming from wealth gives you right
to mock the poor!"

[Both]
"That's you too, idiot!"

Our simultaneous comedic (ultraviolent) thwacks
put Sakuraba on the mat.

[Tomoki]
"And not only are you rich, but you're a moron too."

[Sakuraba]
"Sorry..."

[Taichi]
"So yeah, he's a moron, but 'The Morons' is still
not really an acceptable suggestion."

[Touko]
"Whatever."

[Miki]
"It doesn't look like we're getting anywhere."

[Taichi]
"What do you think, Misato?"

[Misato]
"Hmmm... Let's see."

It really wasn't something we could leave to this
bunch of idiots.
Misato folded her arms and thought.

[Misato]
"Since Pekke's the DJ... Kurosu Channel."

[Sakuraba]
"It's simple..."

[Taichi]
"I think it's perfect."

[Miki]
"And since it uses my favorite guy's name,
I think it's supercute!"
"Or at least, that's what Kiri whispered in my ear."

[Kiri]
"I did not!"

Kiri was enraged.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh! You were hiding your true feelings to get me
all riled up! I'm going to ask you out on a date,
Kiri Sakura!"

[Kiri]
"I never said that!"

[Tomoki]
"Well then... Why not 'cross' instead of Kurosu?"

[Misato]
"Oh, kind of English it up a bit!"

Tomoki seemed flustered for a moment when Misato
talked to him.

[Tomoki]
"I guess."

[Misato]
"So, 'Cross Channel'... I like it!"

Still looking perplexed, Tomoki nodded.

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, it doesn't sound bad."

[Misato]
"Pekke, what do you think?"

[Taichi]
"I am beyond delighted for my humble moniker to be
graced with such glory."

[Sakuraba]
"Wait."

[Taichi]
"Oh, come now Grumpsputin. You're surely not about
to bring your grumpiness to bear on the exquisite
name we've found, are you?"

[Sakuraba]
"Not Cross Channel, it should be CROSSCHANNEL!"

[Tomoki]
"No clue. I have no clue what this guy is saying."

[Taichi]
"Hey...that's not bad."

[Tomoki]
"You got that?!"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm sure of it."

[Taichi]
"It's really good, actually. I didn't think you had
it in you!"

It was settled.
And so opened the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club's
CROSSCHANNEL.

[Taichi]
"Tally ho, Tomoki, broadcast time! Stoke the
boiler!"

[Tomoki]
"What boiler?"

[Sakuraba]
"Hard to starboard!"

[Tomoki]
"Wait, are we at sea?"

Tomoki's reaction was perfunctory.

[Touko]
"The three idiots."

Touko grumbled, clearly irritated.

[Taichi]
"If it weren't for some idiocy, we never could have
gotten everyone here."

[Touko]
"Hmm?"

[Misato]
"It would have been nice if everyone really were
here."

Misato breathed in a cloud of dejection.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, Kirihara, since you're here why not let
yourself get soaked by my wicked verbal flow?"

[Touko]
"Christ, you're a moron."

She turned away and popped a candy back in her
mouth.
She crunched it to powder.

[Taichi]
"Oh, are you shy all of a sudden?"

I looked up at her from below. I was about 5 cm
from her open lips.

[Touko]
"Whaaarghh?!"

Touko spat out her novel exclamation, a fusion of
"What?!" and "Argh," and drove her fist into a face.

[Taichi]
"Right, let's get started!"

[Miki]
"It's good that this isn't a visual medium."

[Taichi]
"Seriously!"

I certainly wouldn't want anyone to see my face
after that punch.
I sat in front of the waiting mic.
The evening breeze was pleasant.
It swept gently over the rooftop and brushed away
the scent of the lingering summer heat.
I tensed myself.
I gazed toward Youko, and gave a thumbs-up.

[Youko]
"..."

She gave me one back.

[Misato]
"Hasekura...?"

Misato was the only one to notice our exchange.

[Taichi]
"Oh yeaaah!"
"Now everyone is here!"

[Misato]
"You...did this, Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"I mean, it is all just pretend, isn't it?"

It was futile.
Idleness.
Nothing but a giant scam.

[Taichi]
"But it was something we had to do."

[Misato]
"..."

Misato stood frozen in place.

[Misato]
"But... I just..."
"It's so important...!"

[Taichi]
"It's ok...you don't need to say it."
"We're all here. That's all!"

[Misato]
"I..."

All of us were in one place.
Everyone, right here.
Even the people who weren't club members.
We stood amid the wreckage of our friendships,
birthed of countless lies and deceit.
All of this might help extend our lives here, extend
the time until our souls crumble, just a bit longer.

[Tomoki]
"Nice one, Taichi."

[Miki]
"Counting down to 6 o'clock...in 5, 4..."

Miki stopped speaking, but continued the countdown
using her fingers.
*3*
It was a dream.
*2*
This ridiculous club activity, like regular students
having a normal day.
*1*
I just wanted us to have something to remember.
*0*
How satisfying...
I inhaled.
I dropped the script.
The summer-scented evening wind started to carry it
away.

[Misato]
"What?!"

She jumped after the script as it scattered into the air.
It was time to start.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club."

Even if I knew it was a waste of time.
I would hang on to life.
Because I wanted to believe this story that we told.
And I spoke my words of power.
