I wasn't attacked during the night.
It's my home turf, anyway.
She didn't know if I had set traps, so why risk it?
I headed to school.
And then...
Tomoki had died.

[Taichi]
"..."

Another suspect down.
And another victim added.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki..."

Such a pitiful death.
A thick, long piece of industrial wire was stuck in
his chest.
It was too rare to be an accident.
Someone did it.
So the perpetrator was...

[Taichi]
"This...is it."

The world will end.
That was how I felt.
Kiri was broken, and Sakuraba wasn't coming back.
I had no reason to be acting like a human.
In the end, it all went to nothing...
I couldn't be a normal person.
If other people couldn't understand...
I thought they could just stop trying to understand.
I didn't care...
I was exposed to desolation in the presence of
Tomoki's body.
I didn't even need to say anything.
I soon lost words I had for myself.
Where was Kiri?
She wasn't at school.
Probably not at home, either.
She must be lurking.
Kiri...
No, anybody was fine...
Right. Misato.
She was always on the rooftop.
But...she wasn't there.
The fence was broken.
Misato was dead.
When a person falls, they looked like a pink
blossom.

[Taichi]
"..."

Yeah.
Blood had a sweet scent.
It was becoming hard to comprehend.
That was too much.
What was the point...of all this hard work?
I held myself back.
And...
I dodged.
An arrow flew past.
It was Kiri.
She was there.
She was there!

[Kiri]
"Murderer...!"

She held a red tube upside down.
It was a fire extinguisher.
White smoke surrounded us.

[Taichi]
"Cough..."

My vision was clouded.
But I was getting used to it.
I could sense Kiri.
She suddenly leapt at me.
I grabbed her wrist.
She had a blade.
I squeezed hard at her hand.

[Kiri]
"Urgh."

She didn't let go.
She bared her anger like a beast.
I squeezed even harder.

[Kiri]
"Ah, aaaaaah!"

That had to hurt.
She had such thin wrists after all.
I could break them easily.
But I didn't let go.
Ahh.
Did she saw Tomoki's body?
I didn't even do it.
I started to want her as I dug in.
Kiri.
You're a fool but you're cute.
I sucked in her lips.

[Kiri]
"Mmmmmmmmm?!"

[Taichi]
"Er..."

She bit my tongue.
But not all the way through.
My thoughts became clear.

[Taichi]
"Kiri...it was me."

[Kiri]
"Aah, now you admit it?!"

The hand holding the knife stayed firm.

[Taichi]
"No."

[Kiri]
"What? Ahahah."

She scoffed.
Then cried.
She was emotionally destroyed.

[Kiri]
"Don't take Miki away from me."

[Taichi]
"Miki."
"Miki is the perpetrator."

She stopped.
Maybe it was the only key to make her stop.
The wind stopped blowing.

[Kiri]
"Huuuh...?"

A curious voice crept from deep within.
Then I realized it was a fatal wound.
And at the same time, I felt a slight pain in my thigh.
It was an arrow.
It pierced her slender chest and stuck in my thigh.
I lifted my face.

[Taichi]
"I knew it..."

[Miki]
"Ahahah, this is the first time I got you down."

She sounded and looked so innocent.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"Uh...What...? Miki?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

Her knife dropped.
She tried to move...but failed.

[Taichi]
"Ow."

[Kiri]
"Am I...shot?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Kiri]
"By who?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"No way...cough..."

Blood poured from her mouth.

[Kiri]
"I-it hurts...Miki...Mi-..."

Miki watched until Kiri's last breath.
She showed absolutely no emotion.

[Taichi]
"What a foolish thing to do... Wasn't she your
friend?"

[Miki]
"..."

Kiri spewed a large amount of blood.

[Taichi]
"Who are you?"

[Miki]
"I'm Miki."

[Taichi]
"No. Miki isn't that tenacious."

[Miki]
"I've grown stronger. Thanks to you all."

I couldn't believe her...

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Miki...where are you? Are you behind me?
I can't turn around..."

Every time Kiri shifted, pain shot through my thigh.
And.
I managed to return to my senses.

[Kiri]
"It can't be Miki, right? She didn't shoot me...right?"

[Miki]
"I did it. It was me."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"
"Don't lie..."

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

She looked up at me.
With her pierced chest, that was all she could do.

[Kiri]
"You're...innocent?"

[Taichi]
"Not really. But I haven't killed anyone. I don't
want to."

[Kiri]
"..."
"S-sorr..."

She couldn't even form an apology.
I gently put my hands to her neck.

[Taichi]
"Go to sleep and dream. When you wake up,
everything will be back to normal."

It was contradictory but Kiri laughed.

[Kiri]
"Ahah."

I choked her a bit. It was enough.

[Kiri]
"Auh...."

I killed her mercifully.

[Miki]
"...!"

[Taichi]
"Ow...!"

I pulled her body along with the arrow.
My wound wasn't deep.
But I could barely move.

[Taichi]
"Are you going to kill me too...?"

[Miki]
"Did you finish her off for me?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Miki]
"How nice of you."

[Taichi]
"So, are you going to kill me too?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Miki]
"Do you want to know?"
"I thought you lost your senses when you're out of
control."

[Taichi]
"You know about me too, huh."

[Miki]
"Also about Youko."

[Taichi]
"Why did you kill everyone?"

[Miki]
"I didn't kill them."

[Taichi]
"Then who did?"

[Miki]
"It's just a coincidence."

[Taichi]
"Miki, quit playing around. Tell me the truth."

[Miki]
"Well I am telling you the truth. It's just a
coincidence. I call it the unseen hand."

[Taichi]
"The unseen hand?"

[Miki]
"Sometimes, these things happen."
"First, it was Youko. She died for the first time."
"I did set the trap, but first for someone to 
get killed."

[Taichi]
"You set that trap..."

[Miki]
"Yeah, you taught me."

[Taichi]
"I don't remember."

[Miki]
"A long time ago. About 10 weeks, or more."
"I was being cautious because I didn't want you to
go near that place. I wanted to keep an eye for
intruders."

[Taichi]
"What place?"

[Miki]
"That place is exempted from the loop."

[Taichi]
"Loop..."

[Miki]
"This world keeps on repeating a week."

And then Miki explained.
A week, from Monday to Sunday.
When the world reached that point, it returned back
to Monday again.
Loop.
That's what Miki called it.

[Taichi]
"That's hard to swallow."

[Miki]
"I have no reason to lie."
"Memories and conditions all go back to their
original state."
"So even Kiri will be back to life once this week
ends."
"Of course she'll have no recollection of being
killed once it is Monday again."

[Taichi]
"If that's so, how come you know this?"

[Miki]
"The shrine is the only place outside of the loop."

[Taichi]
"Meaning...you live at that shrine."

[Miki]
"Only at the last second on Sunday."

[Taichi]
"But why kill everyone just because there is a loop?"

[Miki]
"Because I can't die."

[Taichi]
"That doesn't make sense."

[Miki]
"There was already a note there when I first noticed
the shrine."
"In the notebook, everyday until up to Saturday was
written in detail by you."

[Taichi]
"By me...?"

[Miki]
"You and Youko are more likely to realize the truth
even though our memories get reset every time by
this loop."
"And since we lose our memories, you started to
write. Probably to help your 'reset self' grasp the
situation easier."
"But you never notice that being at the shrine
preserved the proper time."
"Youko didn't want to preserve her decent self
though..."
"Well, she wasn't a decent person after all."
"Anyway, once the week has passed, everyone's
memories will be reset."
"That's just like dying and being reborn right?"
"It doesn't matter how much you write. You can't
replace the time lost when it resets."
"It's like dying every time."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"I don't want that."
"I want to live on as myself."
"Even if this world won't move forward, I don't want
my consciousness to loop."

[Taichi]
"I understand how you feel but...why kill everyone?"

[Miki]
"Like I said, it's a coincidence."
"Even if everything repeats, there's a possibility
that Youko fell in the trap, right?"

[Taichi]
"Once in a blue moon."

[Miki]
"And at some point, a possibility for Touko, Tomoki
and Mimi...to die too."
"That's what happened this time."

[Taichi]
"So, excluding the fault of the one who set the
trap, it's all coincidence?"

[Miki]
"Sometimes, there's a chance that coincidence
becomes the indiscernible killer."
"In this loop world, 'sometimes' is a certain event."

Miki even implicitly affirmed "The infinite monkey
theorem" of Shakespeare.

[Taichi]
"Touko was stabbed, you know?"

[Miki]
"That was me."

[Taichi]
"Say what?"

[Miki]
"Touko starved to death every time."
"And this time she was already dead, so I stuck a
knife in her body."

[Taichi]
"Your reason being?"

[Miki]
"To set off Kiri..."
"To get her to kill you."

[Taichi]
"Miki..."

[Miki]
"Hey, I don't hate you."
"It's just that...you're dangerous."
"You have a high probability of going out of
control."
"You're nuts when you see blood, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

[Miki]
"I've been managing to work it out so that you're
stable."

[Taichi]
"Hahah, you're just looking out for me."

[Miki]
"Yup!"
"I like you when you're kind."

Her feelings dwelled for a moment.

[Miki]
"But there was an irregularity this time when Youko
died."

Her face went empty again.

[Miki]
"She often found my camp since she's always been by
herself lurking."

[Taichi]
"Is your camp next to the shrine?"

[Miki]
"Yes. I borrowed supplies... Don't move."

[Taichi]
"I want to stop the bleeding..."

[Miki]
"Sorry... I can't let you do that..."

[Taichi]
"Because you're going to kill me?"

[Miki]
"Yeah..."

I felt dejected.

[Taichi]
"Ahh... If what you're saying is true, then I'll
just come back to life."

[Miki]
"About Youko, I surrender immediately every time she
found me and just tell her everything I know."
"Since I know I won't win even if I resist."

[Taichi]
"You're too selfish."

[Miki]
"When Youko died, your reaction was strange."
"There was this time when Kiri had a weird neurosis,
but this time you lost it pretty much in an instant,
didn't you?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you're right."

[Miki]
"I cannot die."
"Just like you said, I'm important to myself."
"More important than anyone."

[Taichi]
"I see..."
"That's your true color."

[Miki]
"Yes, that's the way it is."
"I don't understand people's pain."
"It's like I'm just pretending to be a human."
"That's what Kiri said when she attacked you."

[Taichi]
"I don't remember."

[Miki]
"Ah, there was that incident."

[Taichi]
"Oh, me before I get reset."

[Miki]
"It's not like you're camouflaging."
"But... You try to exist as human."
"The real mimic...is me. Like a parasite."

[Taichi]
"Can't you just go hide at the shrine?"

[Miki]
"That's okay, but..."
"It's so boring, I'll go nuts."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's true..."

[Miki]
"I try to maintain everyone's mental condition, and
negotiate with Youko. Then I noticed...I'll repeat
that forever."

[Taichi]
"That's rough."

[Miki]
"But when I do that, only I remain innocent... You
all act like fools..doing club activities..."

[Taichi]
"Being at the shrine preserves subjective
time...then at some point, you'll become an adult."

[Miki]
"I haven't thought about that."
"Eventually I won't be able to handle it, and I'll
have to be reset."
"And if that happens...that Miki won't be this Miki
anymore..."

[Taichi]
"That scares you?"

[Miki]
"Yes."
"I'm afraid of losing myself."

Tears ran down her face.

[Miki]
"I don't want to lose it in this abandoned world."
"But..."
"I feel like I'm alone for some reason."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"I feel so empty."

Miki put down her weapon.

[Miki]
"I feel even more empty having talked to you."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, because it's like talking to the principal."

[Miki]
"You don't even look afraid..."

[Taichi]
"But it was a very interesting conversation."

[Miki]
"Ahahah... You really are greater than me."

[Taichi]
"Youko's a much different one, you know?"

[Miki]
"She's like the nearest to perfection as a human
being."
"But you're different."
"You're like me. You're worse than me, but you've
worked so much harder than me."
"You don't give up."

She approached.

[Miki]
"Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"You're the first person I have fallen in love with."

[Taichi]
"It's an honor."

I closed my eyes.
I made it easier for her to kill me.
And...

[Miki]
"See you next week."

[Taichi]
"Until next week."

I lost consciousness.
