[Taichi]
"Ouuuuch..."

As I was leaving home for school, I slipped and fell.
I hit my head.
My skull was solid so there was no damage.
But...

[Taichi]
"What's with this feeling today...?"

Even if I started a monologue, I wouldn't have 
been able to explain it.
It felt like I was just going to sugarcoat
everything I would have said.
My senses felt numb.
Not just numb, but something more.
It felt like I was a bungee jumper, and my rope was
on the verge of snapping.
Something was off, but still, I needed to head to
school.
Youko was there.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Youko]
"M-morning."

She looked a little scared.
Maybe I made too much fun of her.

[Taichi]
"I promise I won't do anything, even with all this
weird stuff happening."

I beckoned her to come over.
I smiled at her.

[Taichi]
"I'm being honest, come here."

Youko relaxed a little and came closer.
I pinched her cheeks.

[Youko]
"..."

I harassed her out of reflex.
Her expression remained unchanged.
A hint of disgust showed through her poker face.

[Taichi]
"Good morning!"

[Youko]
"Liar."

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

She was right.

[Taichi]
"Since I'm arabesque."

[Youko]
"I think you meant picaresque."

[Taichi]
"..."

I poked her.

[Youko]
"Ow."

She was in pain, but she didn't show it in her
expression.

[Taichi]
"Oh, I'll never forgive myself for such a mistake!"

[Youko]
"Then why don't you go and beat yourself up... By
the way, that hurts a lot..."

She didn't look like she was in any pain at all.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, what's up?"
"It's rare to see you in daylight. I thought you'd
become nocturnal."

[Youko]
"This."

It was a paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Women's underwear?"

[Youko]
"Do you need it?"

[Taichi]
"No... But, I wonder..."

By reflex, I became defensive.

[Youko]
"But you have so many in your drawers."

[Taichi]
"Well... I don't really need them if they haven't
been worn."

[Youko]
"I see..."

She took off her underwear.

[Taichi]
"Stop! I don't need it!"

[Youko]
"Hm."

[Taichi]
"I almost feel like I should get a photo of you
taking them off, then I can auction off the photo
along with your panties."

[Youko]
"...Seriously?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, I could wear four pairs on my head, two on each
wrist as bracelets, then indulge in a feast of
panties."

[Youko]
"If that's what you really want."

Was she really okay with that?
She spoke so indifferently.

[Taichi]
"Hey... Pull yourself together. You're a third-year."

[Youko]
"I'm fine."

[Taichi]
"You're not. Something's up."

[Youko]
"That's unexpected..."
"You're a blockhead."

[Taichi]
"It must be that point in the year.
It's called puberty."

I checked what was inside the paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Sandwiches?"

There was quite a lot too.

[Youko]
"I tried to keep the fresh food as best as I could,
I made it with what was left."

[Taichi]
"You made it?"
"That's right, without people, the fruit and
vegetables..."

[Youko]
"For the time being. I'll manage a few fields and
greenhouses... I wonder if it'll be enough for two
of us to survive..."

[Taichi]
"There's eight of us though."

I emphasized by indicating with my fingers.

[Taichi]
"You shouldn't think like that. Humanity will be
destroyed."
"We decided to live respectably, right?"

[Youko]
"Yeah..."

She nodded obediently.
After all, all she did was mechanically respond to
what I said.
It was annoying.

[Taichi]
"Thanks. I appreciate it. I think it's a bit too
much though."

[Youko]
"..."

I felt her facial muscles move slightly.
(Under my fingers.)

[Taichi]
"It could be enough for two people."

[Youko]
"..."

I felt her facial muscles move slightly.
(Under my fingers.)
If I hadn't been touching her, I wouldn't have been
able to pick up the subtle changes in her
expression.

[Taichi]
"..."
"It could be enough for two people."

I tried saying it again.

[Youko]
"..."

I felt her facial muscles move slightly.
(Under my fingers.)
Aha!
I had such an evil idea.

[Taichi]
"These sandwiches that are enough for two...
I'll be sure to..."
