[Miki]
"Taaiichii...."

I heard a voice from behind me.

[Taichi]
"Miki..."

Her eyes were bloodshot.
Looked like she had been weeping for days.

[Taichi]
"Uh, are you all right?"

[Miki]
"I guess so..."

[Taichi]
"You have to live, Miki!"

[Miki]
"But this is awful..."

She was in the lowest of spirits.

[Miki]
"What do we do about food, or clothes, or TV?"

[Taichi]
"It's fine. There'll be a reset."

[Miki]
"Hwuh?"

[Taichi]
"We'll be all right. Don't worry."

[Miki]
"Oooogh..."

Miki was completely dejected.

[Taichi]
"Cheer up. You're still my pupil, after all."

[Miki]
"But this is all so strange..."

[Taichi]
"That's the world we live in."

[Miki]
"It's too much."

[Taichi]
"Let me help you cheer up, then."

[Miki]
"Help me cheer up?"

I poked her chest.
*squish*

[Miki]
"Squish?!"

She quickly resisted.
I reached for her ass.
*squeeze*

[Miki]
"Squeeze?!"

So slender. So soft. So nice.
She was fragile. Too fragile.

[Taichi]
"Explosive switch!"

I pressed the hook on the back of her clothing.
I applied pressure with my fingertip and began
vibrating it. I could feel the hook coming undone
millimeter by millimeter.
*fwump*

[Miki]
"Wh-Whoa?!"

Her hands dramatically flew up to cover
her breasts.
For a girl of her proportions, a bra wasn't even
needed.
She'd become too pitiful if I completely took her
bra off, so...

[Taichi]
"To finish you off!"

Fly away!

[Miki]
"Heeeey!!"

With that, I pulled out all my best tricks.
Miki was absolutely defenseless from such amazing
sensations.

[Taichi]
"All cheered up now?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, I, am!"

She was pissed.

[Taichi]
"No worries then."

I had also replenished my energy from cheering
her up.

[Miki]
"Bleh!"

She stuck out her small tongue, then ran off.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"
