No one was around.
I hadn't seen Touko in a while.

[Taichi]
"I know it's not really your thing, but why don't
you try coming to club tomorrow?"

I just said it to myself.
That's what I would have said if Touko had been
here.
If we're going to play teenage games, it would be
best to have everyone.
I had something worth writing in my journal today.
I usually didn't have anything to write about.
I wasn't even sure why I had one.
My handwriting was terrible.
Even my own name looked awful when I wrote it.
I wanted everyone to get together on Sunday if it
was possible.
Ah, I couldn't write in my journal on Sundays.
But I wanted to see the spectacle at least once.
The reset could be a fearsome phenomenon.
Like dying.
So... Even just once...

[Taichi]
"I'll try inviting them..."

I headed to the post office.
Raided the post office.
Stole at least 30 post cards.
I passed by in front of the police station
like nothing happened.
Why not raid the police station too?
That was my first time entering one.

[Taichi]
"Hm, so this is what the inside looks like."

I wondered if there were any guns in here.
I found handcuffs.
But nothing else caught my interest.

[Taichi]
"Oops."

I didn't have time to be doing that.
I hurried back.
Wrote on the postcards.

[Taichi]
"All right..."

I wrote to them.
It was a busy night.
