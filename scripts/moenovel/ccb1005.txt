One of the good things about living in the country
was the cool nights.
There was a cool wind that felt good on the skin.
I had a lot to write about.
I had to write in my diary and start on the script
for the broadcasting club's composition.
I started with the script.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

What would be good for the club's first broadcast?

[Taichi]
"..."

I just couldn't get started on it.
Write, erase, write, erase.
One step forward, one step back.
After an hour, I threw what I had down on the desk.
Jeez, only a few lines!
"We are the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club. We have
taken control of this broadcast area. We advise all
personnel to abandon arms..."

[Taichi]
"No, no, no!"

I ripped it up and threw it away.
I wanted to make an impression, but I was going
completely off-track!
I should have been more serious.
I had tried to slip a joke in, but it just didn't work.

[Taichi]
"I give up."

I just couldn't get into it.
I decided to write in the diary instead.
"Focus on your emotions!"
"Who first thought of putting curry inside a bun as
a snack? I mean, the sheer genius."
"That question always gets me so bolstered."
   *Bolstered = Taichi's mistaken word for bothered.
    He mixed up how bad logic bothers, while
    good logic is bolstered by facts.
    He also spells 'turtleneck' as 'totalneck.'
    All because he thought since it covered
    necks...
    Of course totalneck would make more sense.
"It's like I've been croxxing back and forth on some
path I'd never considered crossing, and my days seem
to conclude in emptiness."
   *Croxxing = Taichi's stylistic mispelling.
"Baudelaire once said..."
"God is dead."
"Doubt, or the absence of faith and naivete, is a
virture peculiar to this age, for no one is obedient
nowadays."
@@*Virture = Another Taichi misquote.
"For example, in class, when starting up a bare
conversation with an obstinate woman."
@@*Bare = Taichi's mixup for 'barren.'
"Or in the hall, when we meet two friends, one close
and one estranged, at the same time."
"And the two of them are building a friendly
relationship."
"I, to each of them (flow of obscene sentences)."
"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in
silence."
"Those were the famous words of Kierkegaard."
"The neutral beauty of Kiri, and my proper passion
for her, I will now cease talking about."
"That wasn't the only pleasure in my life."
"That's right."
"For the one who I met on the roof, my life's guide,
the lovely, compassionate, and motherly Misato, I
have not enough room in my paiges."
@@*Paiges = Taichi's mispelling of 'pages.'
"First, her thighs are, to say the least-
(The following sentences are censored.)"
"And in my hands, was the bra that held up her
breasts."
"And though it lost its warmth from the motion of
her breasts, the smell sent my mind into a ravishing
fantasy."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-FIN-
I knew it.
I was filled with poetry and philosophy.
If I had been born in the city of art, London, I
would have been established as a genius artist by
now.
I was a master of words.
Imagery, irony, hyperbole and alliteration. I could
do it all.

[Taichi]
"Hm."

I stretched out and relaxed.
Not bad for an author.
Though perhaps some of it was a bit extreme for
modern Japan, it would need to be censored.
Maybe I should keep writing while I'm on a roll.
I guess I could pedantically illustrate some scenes
into a luxurious and delicate manuscript.
I got in the mood again, and picked up the pen.
