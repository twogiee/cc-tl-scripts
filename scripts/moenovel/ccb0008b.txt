[Taichi]
"Whoops."

I slipped.
An accident. Totally unintentional.
My arm waved wildly.
My body was pulled towards the ground by the force
of gravity (or rather by Newton).
As if to save me from the fall, my hand reached out
for her skirt.

[Miki]
"Huh?"

I'm not sure if she was caught off guard or not, but
Miki still smiled and just stood there.
Oh no!
The main character's spontaneous act of touching
breasts or touching butts could go against the
ethics of the "For All Ages" regulation!
But it was unintentional!
And...
*creak*
I somehow heard a door open.
In reality, it was a mysterious door that had been
unlocked for 25 billion males (currently just
three).
A secret domain only visible to the unfortunate
ground and floor, poorly destined to be stomped by
all of mankind.
But as sacred it may be, it was a door that every
cherry teenager went through to become an adult.
However, that door was not square-shaped, but a
triangle (lol). *lol, an American form of laughter.
Americans laugh at the punch-line of their own
jokes (even when they're not funny)!
Such a strange custom, and I just used it to prove
that I wasn't an airhead by intentionally placing it
after some lame, random remark.

[Miki]
"Shoot."

She kept her smile, but her mouth twitched.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, my hand subconsciously went for it."

[Miki]
"No, it was my fault for being careless."

[Taichi]
"Um, it may not be something I should say but...
That lingerie is very sexy. Big bro is kinda
surprised. In a good way."

[Miki]
"That's kind of you. When are you going to take your
hand off?"

[Taichi]
"Th-that, that underwear is, tidy, and, and deltas
and your body is honest, the color wraps around and,
you know, the kitty-cat."

My thoughts were everywhere in pieces.

[Miki]
"Sir, holding on any longer may be hazardous
to your mental state, sir!"

[Taichi]
"I can't, it's impossible. My hand is petrified
like it's not mine. It's not easy like some kid
lock-picking a door to their home."
"But...it sure is beautiful."

[Miki]
"Sir, such kind words. It would bring me happiness
if you would let go soon."

[Taichi]
"It's nothing that an anime figure could even
represent. Even if it was designed by the hand of a
first-class visual designer!"

[Miki]
"I'll kill you."

[Taichi]
"Ahhhh, you're for real?!"

She had the eyes of a hunter.
I removed my hand.
And fell to the ground.

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

Needless to say, I had seen it.

[Taichi]
"Ah, but your taste is very mature, like an adult."

I humbly said.

[Miki]
"Yeah, sure."

Miki blushed a little.

[Taichi]
"Why are you dressed in such colorful lingerie?"

[Miki]
"Um, there's no water so I can't do any laundry."
"So I just got some new ones from the store."

[Taichi]
"So... You decided to get sexy ones, the kind you
don't usually get?"

[Miki]
"...Yes."

Hmm.
Should I tell her?
Or just leave it alone?

[Taichi]
"H-hey, Miki-lin."

[Miki]
"Miki-lin here. What is it?"

[Taichi]
"So that underwear..."
"Umm..."
"The thing is, they're a kind of play-underwear. I
guess you could call them open-pants."

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Umm so, you know, play-underwear. For adults."

She just stood there with a finger pointed towards
her mouth.

[Taichi]
"So... Well, there may be a hole in a weird spot."
"You could say it's like a type of shortcut!"

She kept her finger pointed at her perfect smile.
Then...

[Miki]
"..."

*dash*
She ran off.
I got up and dusted off.
She spent a minute in the bathroom.
And then came back.

[Miki]
"Th-this this this this is?!"

[Taichi]
"So you probably obtained it at Atomic Goods (a
variety store), they have normal and adult underwear
lined up next to each other."
"See, it's next to those apartments, right? They
probably have a lot of young wives over there."
"I go to that store often, too."

I gave a thumbs-up and showed my sparkling teeth.

[Miki]
"Ohhh?!"

She was protecting her crotch region with her hands,
front and back.

[Taichi]
"Calm down."
"Now, it'd be a huge problem if you encountered a
molester wearing that."

[Miki]
"Waaahhhhh."

Miki held her crotch area and fidgeted her feet.

[Taichi]
"Now then."
"What would happen if Kiri found out about this?"

I pretended to smoke a cigarette.

[Miki]
"Wha, Taichi, are you-?!"

[Taichi]
"If that clean-freak Kiri found out... Whew!"
"Perhaps the Flowers would disband?"

[Miki]
"Nyaahh?!"

She clung on.

[Taichi]
"I didn't know Miki wore such perverted underwear...
Filthy."
"No more exchanging lunch, too."

[Miki]
"Anything but that!"

[Taichi]
"Then listen to my demands!"

[Miki]
"So long as it's not giving up my virginity."

[Taichi]
"Fine. I command you."

I put my hand on her head.
Miki was startled a little.
But she didn't oppose.

[Taichi]
"Clean."

[Miki]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"No, you have two options."
"Clean or muff-muff!"

[Miki]
"What is muff-muff?"

[Taichi]
"Hm, muff-muff is..."
"My aristocratic mind cannot explain this very well,
but basically..."
"Thrust my face in between your legs and muff-muff,
muff-muff..."

[Miki]
"Muff-muff is a negatorio!"
*Negatorio = Nope. Never. Interjection.
"Giving it a cute name doesn't help! It's still
perverted!"

[Taichi]
"It'd sure be nice to muff-muff right now."

[Miki]
"Nooooooo, no muff-muff!!"

[Taichi]
"It's either be loathed by Kiri, or muff-muff!
War or Peace!"

[Miki]
"Yes, um, cleaning? Wasn't cleaning an option?"

She tearfully raised a hand.

[Taichi]
"Hm. So you choose cleaning?"

[Miki]
"Cleaning is...just cleaning, right?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it's definitely cleaning, but the area is...
Heeheeh."

[Miki]
"My chastity is over."

Miki gave in.

[Miki]
"I speak to the wind. The short and long days of my
virginity. This is a step toward adulthood. My only
desires..."

Miki started narrating an imaginary poem.

[Taichi]
"Just kidding."

[Miki]
*sob sob* "Just be easy on me..."

[Taichi]
"I said I was joking."
"Here, a mop."

I handed it to her.

[Miki]
"...?"
"You want to...use the mop?"

[Taichi]
"You can get your mind out of the gutter now."

Miki was still confused.

[Taichi]
"You were cleaning, right?"

She nodded.

[Taichi]
"Then promptly continue cleaning."
"That is what I desire."

[Miki]
"Sir..."
"Thanks."

It was nothing.
Just cleaning up my own mess.

[Taichi]
"I give you permission to fall in love with this
Taichi Kurosu."

[Miki]
"I deny that request."

[Taichi]
"Hey..."
