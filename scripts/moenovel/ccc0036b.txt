It was Wednesday.
Newton laughed from his grave as I followed
his laws of physics and headed to school.
I walked up the hill.
It was as steep as ever.
Progress was slow.
I finally reached flat ground.

"...!"

I suddenly felt something. A premonition. My senses
tingled.
My body moved faster than I thought possible.
I looked back!

[Taichi]
"Nobody there..."

I was so sure that I had felt eyes on me.
