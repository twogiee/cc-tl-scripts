And so the world turns...
How many times have I relived this Monday?
I was thinking of that and other things.
And just then I found Miki.
Turns out she found me, too.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Mickey Mou-"

Suddenly my joke was stifled by copyright
regulations.
She started running.
And was heading my way...
While stumbling like crazy.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, sorry, my fault! I didn't know the Copyright
Term Extension Act was still in effect!"

[Miki]
"Waaaaah!!"

She was crying.

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

She flew right into me.
I held her for a moment.

[Miki]
"Taichi, Taichi, Taaiiiiichiiii!"

She was sobbing.

[Miki]
"Everybody is gone! It's so weird...this is really
strange!!"

She wasn't handling this very well.
Maybe she never experienced it before?

[Miki]
"There's no one in the houses... Everybody is gone!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, since last night, right?"

I patted her back to comfort her.
I was weak to girls' tears.

[Miki]
"But, but..."

[Taichi]
"I'm here though."

[Miki]
"Oh...yeah... I'm glad...you're here."

I wish I could have thought of a joke, but nothing
came to mind.

[Miki]
"When I woke up, Mom was gone... There wasn't any
food... I thought I was the only person left..."

[Taichi]
"And it scared you, right?"

She nodded while rubbing at her face.

[Miki]
"I don't want this... I don't..."

I looked up at the sky.

[Taichi]
"I guess without people you get lonely."

[Miki]
"...I want to go home..."

That was on point.
There was no way to escape this place.
No way to go back to the real world.
Maybe her words were just coincidental.
But they had hit the mark.

[Taichi]
"You want to go back?"

[Miki]
"Of course I do!"

[Taichi]
"Hey now, what are we going to do with you?"

There was a way to comfort Miki.
It was a bit...unfair though.
A way to get to what we both wanted.
Just for a week.
We could be like that.
Live hard and without regret.
But we only had a week, we would have to move fast.
I quickly tried thinking of several ways
to seduce her.
Then I was kicked.

[Kiri]
"Shaaa!"

[Taichi]
"Agggh!"

Kiri's kick knocked me away from Miki.

[Taichi]
"What the hell was that?!"

[Kiri]
"Stop molesting her!"

[Taichi]
"I'm not molesting her!"

[Kiri]
"There is no way a pervert like you would ever tell
the truth!"

[Taichi]
"I told you, I wasn't doing anything!"

[Miki]
"Whaa, Kiri?"

Miki seemed stunned.
And then Kiri went and held her.

[Miki]
"Waaaaaahhhh!"

[Kiri]
"You're okay... Everything's gonna be okay."

Hey...

[Taichi]
"Miki, aren't you going to tell her I'm innocent?"

[Miki]
*sob, sniff*

She kept sobbing.
In exchange, Kiri just glared at me.

[Kiri]
"I'll never forgive you."
"You pervert!"

[Taichi]
"You're wrong!"

[Kiri]
"Her tears are proof!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey, hey..."

This was serious.
I was being falsely accused! I was innocent!
I had to make an escape.
And I did so by running away at full speed.

[Kiri]
"Ah, he ran away!"
