Kiri was standing in the hallway.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

She glared at me.
I stared right back at her.
Our glares sparked the air between us!
We exchanged glances.
Our hostile glares created a swirl in the atmosphere
where they met.
You child!!
I put my hand in my shirt pocket.
As if I was reaching for a weapon.
But it was actually because my nipples itched.

[Kiri]
"Hnnn!!"

Kiri was on guard.
She reached into her pocket.
She was also reaching for a weapon!

[Taichi]
"Gah."

I kept my hand in my shirt and strengthened my
glare.
Our glares sparked even more.
She wasn't taking her hand out either.
Stalemate.
Quick draw.
The first one to move lost.
Miki came out of the restroom, wiping her hand.

[Miki]
"Waaaah, there's a fight going on while I was in the
restroom!!"

[Taichi]
"I'll save you in a minute, Miki!"

[Miki]
"I'm the hostage in this setting..."

[Kiri]
"Stay back, Miki."

[Miki]
"Wait, but..."

Kiri got low.

[Taichi]
"Heh..."

I relaxed my shoulders.
Took my hand out as well.

[Kiri]
"Hngh..."

Empty handed.
I showed my defenseless self.

[Taichi]
"No more need for bluffing, Kiri."
"I'm unarmed. So you should stop this meaningless
bluff as well."

Man, I was so cool.
I wasn't called the Love Aristocrat for nothing.

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri pulled out her hand.
She was wielding a crossbow.

[Taichi]
"Wah?"

American crossbow!

[Taichi]
"Wait wait wait, hold on."
"Something's up! There's no way something like that
would fit in your pocket!"

[Kiri]
"..."

She silently aimed the crossbow at me.
I could tell that she was aiming at my heart
through the scope.
I could feel her eyes watching me carefully.

[Taichi]
"You're aiming at the heart that the tin man
wanted so much?!"

[Kiri]
"Don't move. I'll shoot."

[Miki]
"Whoa whoa!"

Miki was also stunned.

[Taichi]
"I give, I give!"

I raised my hands up.

[Kiri]
"Ah, easier to aim now..."

She posed to take a better aim.

[Taichi]
"No! Noooo! Stop!"

I shook my head.
I was about to cry.
Well actually, I was already crying.

[Miki]
"Kiri, Kiri! That's not good, you'll be arrested!"

[Kiri]
"There are no police."

[Miki]
"Oh, right."
"Ahh..."

She went quiet.

[Taichi]
"Don't just agree!"

[Kiri]
"On your knees, with your hands behind your head."

[Taichi]
"Yesh."

I abided.

[Kiri]
"What should we do next?"

She whispered with Miki.
I could hear them.

[Miki]
"Disarm him?"

[Kiri]
"He doesn't seem to have anything."

[Miki]
"..."

Thinking time.

[Miki]
"Then how about this?"

They whispered to each other.

[Kiri]
"Roger..."

Kiri nodded.
She looked pretty cool, but she was actually really
close to Miki.
And so, she did as she was told.
That was my means of escape.
Knowing Miki, she was probably going to let me go.
I've treated her so well these past years.

[Kiri]
"Crawl around and bark."

[Taichi]
"Miki!!"

[Miki]
"Teeheeh."

An evil laugh.
She was getting me back for all the times I
sexually harassed her.

[Kiri]
"Hurry."

[Taichi]
"Uh, Ugh..."

I had no choice.
I got on my hands and knees.

[Taichi]
"Woof..."

[Miki]
"I didn't feel your effort so again."

[Taichi]
"Gyaa!"

Embarrassment coated me.
It was the basic of the basic.
But it hurt me to be on the receiving end.

[Kiri]
"Again, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Woof, woof woof woof!"
"How's that for effort!"

[Miki]
"Tell him, who said to bark four times?"

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Kiri]
"Who said to bark four times?"

[Taichi]
"Okay, I got it. Now, whose shoes do I have
to lick? Hm?"

[Miki]
"Are you talking to us as if we're at the same
level?"

[Taichi]
"Please let me lick your shoes, princess."

I put myself at the rock bottom.

[Miki]
"I don't want my shoes to get dirty so no."

[Taichi]
"Heeey!"

[Miki]
"Now, what's waiting for you next?"

Miki had turned into the devil!

[Miki]
"Heeheeheeheeh."

[Taichi]
"Nooo, anything but my body!"

[Miki]
"Life or pride, what's more important to you,
Taichi?"

Miki had awoken the warrior inside her.

[Taichi]
"Wahhh."

Somehow I ended up with my underwear exposed.
