*clang clang clang*
*clang clang clang*
Club activities were in full swing on the rooftop
that morning, as always.
I'd made up my mind to join, but couldn't easily get
approval.
Misato was the one who worked hard for it.
She did it in a way so that I wouldn't notice.
I'd figured out that much soon enough.
Still, even if I wasn't a member, I could still
participate.
For a while, I went on about how I was joining
whenever the mood hit.
I soon came to regret doing so, however, and tried
to take it back.
But...that was overly optimistic on my part.
I slowly pulled back and...

[Misato]
"Kurosu!"

I tried pulling back again, but...

[Misato]
"Hello there!"

I kept getting dragged back in.
Before I knew it, I found myself
in the room more and more.

[Misato]
"Umm."
"Connect...uh...a cable? Into the...what?
Motherboard...slot?"

All club activities revolved around her.
She was the most capable of us all.
At that time, it had been just the two of us.

[Misato]
"Do that...with this...to the hard-disk... Ugh...
More cables..."

[Taichi]
"Wha...?"

I couldn't watch.

[Taichi]
"No. Like this."

[Misato]
"Do you know what you're doing?"

[Taichi]
"More or less..."

[Misato]
"So what about this then?"

[Taichi]
"Umm... Why don't you just buy parts
that are already assembled?"
"That's the way to go if you don't know
what you're doing."

[Misato]
"I thought it would make club more interesting."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

[Misato]
"Ah, I know that sound..."

[Taichi]
"Hey now! Move!"

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"The expensive parts were about to fall."

[Misato]
"Oh, really? Thanks for saving them."

The school may be filthy rich, but I was pretty sure
all of the parts purchased with club funds were
high-end items.

[Misato]
"Huh. You really know your stuff."

[Taichi]
"No more than anyone else."

Ahh, sarcasm.

[Misato]
"Heheheh. My little brother was good
with computers, too."

She didn't get it.

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Misato]
"Well, he is a boy after all."

[Taichi]
"You like 'em young, don't you?"

[Misato]
"Yeah. I think younger boys are cute."

[Taichi]
"..."
"I like 'em old."

Sarcasm, part two.

[Misato]
"I like old ladies, too, but I'd never get involved
with one."

[Taichi]
"Of course you wouldn't!"

That really got me going.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"Oh... Pekke? Whoa!"

Misato screeched from the top of the ladder.
She was red in the face...
And turned redder as she fell from the ladder.
I caught her in my arms.

[Misato]
"Wh-whoa!"

[Taichi]
"This is what I get for helping."

I put her down.

[Misato]
"Th-thanks."

[Taichi]
"You fell like a fat caterpillar."

[Misato]
"Please don't imagine it that way..."

She both grimaced and blushed.

[Taichi]
"There aren't any insects around here."

[Misato]
"Yeah, one of our few blessings..."

[Taichi]
"It's nice not having to hear the cicadas."

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"That reminds me..."

The town was surrounded by nature and always got
tons of cicadas every year.
Plus lots of other bugs, too.
Beetles and other large insects sometimes showed up
on the walls and around the house.
Seeing them around town always reminded me of the
moment the buried grubs broke free from the earth.

[Taichi]
"Talking about bugs while eating shrimp caused a
spoon and fork fight between Touko and I in the
cafeteria."

[Misato]
"Heh..."
"Ahahahahahahah!"

Club was still fun with just the two of us.

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

I sensed something just then.

[Misato]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing. Just nature calling."

[Misato]
"Haven't heard anyone say it like that in a while."

I reached the gate that led into the school.
I opened it, headed to the lower floor, and that's
when I heard hurried footsteps.

[Taichi]
"That wasn't Youko..."

Whoever it was did a bad job of concealing
themselves.
And if that was the case...

[Taichi]
"Tomoki..."

The disobedient fool with the sister complex.
Well, whatever. Gotta get to the restroom.
Mmm... (In the midst)

[Taichi]
"Phew..."

[Youko]
"We meet again..."

[Taichi]
"Oh! It's you!"

The real you.

[Youko]
"Piggyback ride."

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

[Youko]
"Traditional."
"Rescued princess."

[Taichi]
"What the...?"

[Youko]
"These are the ways you've held glasses girl."

[Taichi]
"Glasses girl? You mean..."

[Youko]
"You've held her many different ways."

[Taichi]
"You saw all that...?"

[Youko]
"Rescued princess."
"Rescued princess."
"Rescued princess."

I guess she did see it all.

[Taichi]
"I get what you're saying."

[Youko]
"Rescued princess."

[Taichi]
"You want me to do that for you too? Even at your
age?"

[Youko]
"Age doesn't matter."

[Taichi]
"You can live without it..."

Youko seemed disappointed.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, I could use your help with something.
You know a lot about 'that,' don't you?"

[Youko]
"Rescued princess."

Uhh...

[Taichi]
"So you're willing to negotiate?"

She nodded.

[Taichi]
"Okay, I'll do it. That's what you want, right?"

[Youko]
"Rescued princess bride."

[Taichi]
"I can't do something if I don't know what it is."

[Youko]
"The normal version is fine."

[Taichi]
"Okay. Come here."

[Youko]
"..."

She looked happy at that.
Don't be fooled...
She fit snuggly in my arms.

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Well?"

[Youko]
"It's good..."

[Taichi]
"I'll put you down then."

[Youko]
"No! No!"

She panicked.

[Taichi]
"You want me to hold you for longer?"

[Youko]
"Yes, longer."
"I'm not satisfied yet."

[Taichi]
"Ahh..."

Her weight was making this kind of hard on me.
Muscle weighs more than fat.
The standard specs of the next gen were terrifying.
Next gen is such a strange phrase...

[Youko]
"Walk."

[Taichi]
"Walk?"

[Youko]
"Mm-hm..."

She seemed pleased.
I probably would have liked her more
had she been like this from the start.

[Youko]
"This is good..."

[Taichi]
"I see."

I can totally see through her tactics.

[Youko]
"Like, really good."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

I moved again.
She got heavier and heavier.

[Taichi]
"I think that should just about do it."

[Youko]
"No."

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

I then walked around the school
for almost 10 minutes.

[Taichi]
"S-still?"

[Youko]
"Just a little more..."

[Taichi]
"Ooof..."

My arms.
I did another round.

[Taichi]
"This is really starting to hurt."

[Youko]
"Just a little more."

[Taichi]
"How long is it gonna take for you to be satisfied?"

[Youko]
"Only an hour or so."

[Taichi]
"My arms are gonna fall off."

Forced abdication.

[Taichi]
"I'm done."

[Youko]
"Wha...?"

She seemed so disappointed.
Guess I've got no choice. Sexual harassment it is.

[Taichi]
"I'll do this for you instead."

[Youko]
"Do what?"

[Taichi]
"Something I've tried before."

[Youko]
"Which is?"

[Taichi]
"Reverse shoulder ride."

[Youko]
"I've never heard of it."

[Taichi]
"Think of a normal shoulder ride."

[Youko]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"Normally, the person sitting on top and the person
below face the same direction."
"The reverse version is when the person on top faces
the other way."
"And the bottom person stays as is."
"Reverse shoulder ride."

[Youko]
"..."
"Your perversion knows no bounds."

[Taichi]
"Thanks. So let's give it a try."

[Youko]
"Umm... I think...that'd be...INSANELY
embarrassing."

A rare show of hesitation, I see.

[Taichi]
"Fine. I'll ask Mimi instead."

[Youko]
"Go ahead and squat..."

Too easy.
Mimi would never agree to do this.

[Taichi]
"Great!"

I stood in front of Youko.

[Youko]
"Then..."

She put her thighs on my shoulders.
One at a time.
And the reverse shoulder ride...is complete.

[Taichi]
"Whooooa..."
"Whoooaaaaa..."
"Whooooooaaaaaaa..."

No regrets!!
Tomoki and Mimi had been fighting last year, too.

[Tomoki]
"My si-... Mimi betrayed me..."
"I joined the broadcast club against my will. I
wasn't thinking to join any clubs, but she told me
you were a computer whiz, so I should help."
"Why do I have to make nice and do club activities
with my sister now, after all this time?"

Last year and this year.
Two times the discord.
But each time it was very different.
And today marked a year gone by.
Tomoki was eating bread by himself.

[Taichi]
"Hey..."

[Tomoki]
"Hey. If you want bread, there's some left."
"It might be a bit stale though."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

I thought it was fine...
But there was nothing but curry rolls.
Or so I thought.
Luckily I came across some croquette bread.

[Tomoki]
"Oh? Where did you find that?"

[Taichi]
"You didn't look hard enough."

[Tomoki]
"Wanna trade?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Tomoki]
"Oh, thanks"

Tomoki ate the croquette bread.

[Taichi]
"That comes out of club funds."

[Tomoki]
"Pfft! Don't lie!"
"It's just cafeteria bread."

[Taichi]
"So now you're obligated to help out."

Same tactics she used on me.

[Tomoki]
"Um, how about no!"

[Taichi]
"You're stubborn."

[Tomoki]
"I've got no reason to help you guys."

[Taichi]
"You're family, aren't you?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, but..."

Fatigue hit him all at once.
I said it knowing that would happen.
It did in every single relationship.
The slightest attack became fun.
But they'd leave marks if they were too strong.
Normally, attacks were the only way people
came in contact with each other.
I thought of friendship as your ability
to go easy on someone.

[Taichi]
"You can make it occasionally, can't you?"

[Tomoki]
"You're really pushy today. Not like you."

That's right. It wasn't.

[Tomoki]
"Aren't you in love with the truth?"

[Taichi]
"The truth..."
"D-do you...want me to love you?"

[Tomoki]
"That's not what I meant!"

Jokes and self-deprecation didn't count as attacks.
I knew that.
I had no choice but to be positive with him.
That was the only way to go. In a normal setting.

[Taichi]
"Well, I wouldn't hit on something sensitive."

But now...

[Tomoki]
"I wish you'd get it. I really do."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Tomoki]
"She'll turn on you, you know."

[Taichi]
"I won't know until I see it for myself."

[Tomoki]
"She'll sell you out..."

[Taichi]
"For how much?"

[Tomoki]
"So you have no intention of actually listening,
huh..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry... Serial situations make me feel awkward."

[Tomoki]
"Dude, the word you're looking for is 'serious'!"

He hit the desk.

[Taichi]
"Don't get all hot and bothered on a cold day."

[Tomoki]
"I'm a man, you beanpole!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, we're not talking about the bean market!!"

I was still having nightmares over that.

[Tomoki]
"Scum!"

[Taichi]
"Freak!"

[Tomoki]
"Loser!"

[Taichi]
"Blowhard!"

Our gentle, compromising scrapes
filled my heart with joy.
And I was satisfied.
And so, I went about club activities.
Right-o.
How about here?
Or maybe over there?
What's that hole? Will the cable go through?

[Taichi]
"..."

I'll set it there. It seemed right.

[Misato]
"Do you know what you're doing?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, more or less."

Misato was supporting the ladder below me.

[Misato]
"It's good to have a boy to rely on!"

[Taichi]
"It must be."
"A boy like me to order around..."

...Was more likely what she meant.
Didn't she have a little brother or something?

[Taichi]
"Hey, are you and Tomoki still fighting?"

Misato's face suddenly clouded over.

[Misato]
"Well, I mean..."
"Seems like a cold war."

[Taichi]
"I wonder if Tomoki's fighting back?"

[Misato]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"He's not the type to get so angry."

Misato seemed shocked at what I told her.

[Misato]
"Yeah, probably not, huh."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"I hate this feeling. People are so hard to
understand sometimes."

I had no idea what she was talking about.
"She'll turn on you, you know."

[Taichi]
"So, was it a betrayal or something?"

[Misato]
"..."

Her brow furrowed at that.

[Misato]
"Is that what he told you?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Misato?"

[Misato]
"Mmhmm, mhmm..."

It sounded like she was about to cry.

[Taichi]
"Errr..."

[Misato]
"What should I say?!"

The ladder began to shake with her trembling.

[Taichi]
"Whoa-whoa-whoa?!"

[Misato]
"This is not going to hold!"

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna fall!"

And thus, another full day of club activities came
to an end.

[Misato]
"-ke..."

Misato came by.
She was late by about five minutes.
I thought I'd go look for her if it got to ten.

[Taichi]
"All right."

[Misato]
"Good evening."

She stood under the window with her purse dangling.
And as planned, we ate lunch.

[Taichi]
"It's delicious."
"I didn't know you were a great cook too, Misato."

[Misato]
"You think so? I only just picked up cooking
recently..."

A silly exchange.
And...
Contact.
I kept track of these repeated phenomena.

[Taichi]
"Do you want to go to the beach tomorrow?"

I decided to go ahead and invite her.

[Misato]
"I guess so..."

She said shyly.
It'd be somewhere we could go without needing to
sleep together.

[Taichi]
"So it's already Friday."

Only three days until the world would reset.
I had so much to do.

[Taichi]
"Mimi, I've been waiting."

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"You didn't forget our promise to go to the beach,
did you?"

[Misato]
"Oh yeah... But I haven't prepared for it at all."

[Taichi]
"I took care of all that. Let's go."

[Misato]
"But...by Sunday... I mean, the broadcasting
station..."

[Taichi]
"I've already called for reinforcements."
"And that means we're free to go to the beach."

[Youko]
"I've never gone to the beach with you before."

[Taichi]
"We can go next time."
"Brave this heat to take care of the prep, Youko.
And no surveillance!"

[Youko]
"How convenient this is for you..."

[Taichi]
"Well, it just suits you so well."

Misato feebly shook her head.

[Misato]
"I disagree..."

[Taichi]
"Hiding yourself with that towel spoils your
allure."

[Misato]
"I don't want to be labeled a creep."

[Taichi]
"You won't be."
"I find your modesty to be extremely exciting."

[Misato]
"You're excited, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Yup, a good fit or a bad fit...doesn't matter
because you look good either way."
"Most male perverts will just go with the good fit."

[Misato]
"How about asking men who aren't perverts?!"

[Taichi]
"They don't exist!"

I yelled as I swung both arms.

[Misato]
"This isn't a dream."
"Yeah, I'm a creep... This is so embarrassing..."

She then started yelling about what a creep she was.

[Taichi]
"Don't be embarrassed. You couldn't be less
of a creep if you tried."
"You're just freaked out about wearing
a sexy swimsuit for the first time."

[Misato]
"And that makes me a creep. And you an imbecile."

"Hmmm..."

[Taichi]
"You're a creep. I'm an imbecile. Good match."

[Misato]
"I never wanted to be a creep though..."

[Taichi]
"Mmkay, let's go with beach volleyball like last
year."

It carried more sway this year.
Chest = beach volleyball.
This proposition was absolutely flawless.

[Taichi]
"That..."

[Misato]
"Ooo..."

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

[Misato]
"Ahhh. Oooo..."

[Taichi]
"Why are you receiving with one hand?"

[Misato]
"Because I can feel your eyes on me."

[Taichi]
"But it's just the two of us here."

[Misato]
"They're still your eyes and not mine!"

Okay then, here comes a ball you can only receive
with two hands.

[Taichi]
"Go, magic ball!"

[Misato]
"S-say what?!"
"H-hey! C'mon!"

She used both hands.
*boom!*

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

Her beautiful chest bounced in perfect harmony.

[Misato]
"I can feel your lurid gaze on me."

How observant of you.

[Taichi]
"The magic ball makes me want to pounce."

[Misato]
"So it's the perfect pitch to go on the offensive!"
"Waaah! Stop!"

*bam!*
Her perfect chest rolled like magic.
This was quickly moving up the memory ranking list.

[Taichi]
"Next..."

[Misato]
"Stop it already! Play normally!"

I guess I'll stop there then.
...
We casually hit the ball back and forth.

[Taichi]
"It's fun doing things with people."

[Misato]
"More fun for you than me."

[Taichi]
"I was talking about club."

[Misato]
"Club...?"

[Taichi]
"It's quiet with no one else around.
There's almost nothing left."
"But it's at least fun."
"Doing something with someone is fun."
"Solitude would be suffocating, wouldn't it?"

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"You're not bored, are you?"

[Misato]
"I'm not bored..."
"It's just that...I..."

[Taichi]
"Yes...?"

[Misato]
"I don't want to think about anything."

I tossed the ball to her.
The ball went high and painted a perfect narrow arc.

[Taichi]
"Why not...?"

She returned the ball in the same way.

[Misato]
"I just want to become what I'm doing."

[Taichi]
"Like a robot?"

[Misato]
"Yep."

[Taichi]
"Sounds lonely."

[Misato]
"I appreciate your concern, but..."

[Taichi]
"Humans can't turn into robots, can they?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"You can't help but enjoy the fun times."

I launched the ball noticeably higher.

[Misato]
"There's no leeway."

My shoulders sagged.
The ball fell to the ground.

[Taichi]
"Misato?"

I put on the face of someone ten years older.

[Misato]
"This might be my punishment."
"In response to what I've done."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"I have no right to be young or have fun."

[Taichi]
"Did you really do something that terrible?"

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"I don't believe you."

[Misato]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"I said I don't believe someone like you
could do something that bad."

[Misato]
"Pekke. You don't like knowing what's going on with
others, so that's hardly a compliment."

[Taichi]
"But you're always trying to escape."

I walked over to the ball and picked it up.

[Misato]
"What?!"

[Taichi]
"Club is an escape for you, isn't it?"
"But does that make any sense? I mean, look at what
the world has become."
"Our crimes, regrets, and distress disappeared with
everyone else."
"The institutions that created the notion of crime
no longer exist."
"Do morals hold any weight at all at this point?"
"You really can't seem to let them go."

And me neither, for that matter.

[Misato]
"I'm not sure I can agree with that line of
thinking."
"Emotional scars still remain, don't they?"
"I've done some terrible things."

[Taichi]
"And you regret them, right?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"If you were to return to that time... Would you be
able to make the right choice?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Then there's no point in reflecting on it."
"History will repeat itself."
"And that's who you are."
"I get that about you..."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Even if I don't know the details."
"I just see you trying to escape."
"You really don't need that club."
"Do you plan to just stagnate there forever?"
"I'm sure you take issue with what I'm saying,
but don't you think you should take measures
to turn this around?"

[Misato]
"I...can't..."
"It's absolutely impossible."

[Taichi]
"Why can't you?"

[Misato]
"Because we're all alone now."

[Taichi]
"Then what will you do?"

[Misato]
"That...I don't know."
"You tell me..."

Her contemplative expression disappeared.
Her face went as blank as a lake's still surface.
With agony lurking underneath.

[Taichi]
"You want to be hurt."

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Don't you secretly desire to be punished for all
your sins?"

[Misato]
"I...umm..."

I stepped forward...
And got closer.

[Taichi]
"Should I do it for you?"

Then I went on autopilot.

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It might make things easier for you."

[Misato]
"It just sounds...so strange..."

She was confused.
I didn't let her think.
I drew her close.

[Misato]
"Aaah?!"

She let out a slight scream.
I pulled her in.

[Misato]
"No... We can't..."

She definitely wanted me to though.
I moved my lips closer to hers.

[Misato]
"Ah..."

I pushed back my urges and kissed her.
...
...
...
