[Nanaca]
"Yoo-hoo, Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

It was a girl I didn't know on a bike.

[Taichi]
"It's a girl I don't know on a bike."

I said exactly what I thought.

[Nanaca]
"Don't just say exactly what you're thinking!"

She caught me.

[Taichi]
"This girl seems a bit strange. I can't tell her
lineage. And I've never seen that kind of uniform
before."

[Nanaca]
"......Don't get all defiant and
speak before you think."

[Taichi]
"Your name's Nanaca, right? Or was it Nanoca?"

[Nanaca]
"Gawd, you're too much. Do you ever get tired of
talking?"

[Taichi]
"Which school are you heading to?"

[Nanaca]
"It's a se~cret."

[Taichi]
"Oh, I see."

I disregarded her and quickly walked away.

[Nanaca]
"Oh, so cold-blooded~!"

[Taichi]
"I can walk and talk at the same time."

[Nanaca]
"Well, awright."

[Taichi]
"Are you up to something now?"

[Nanaca]
"Of course I am!"

She struck a finger into the air.

[Nanaca]
"I gotta hurry and set up an antenna!"

[Taichi]
"Say wha?"
"The antenna that Misato is using?"

[Nanaca]
"Yeah, that!"
"But I gotta get a move on, I'm running out
of time!"

[Taichi]
"For what?"

[Nanaca]
"For the deadline."

[Taichi]
"What deadline?"

[Nanaca]
"Jeez, what's with you!"

[Taichi]
"Wh-, what do you mean?"

She got a little snappy.

[Nanaca]
"We only live once! If we're too caught up in things,
they'll forever be futile efforts, and in that moment
existence itself will be in perpetual stasis!"
"That is the nature of potentiality! Like when
Wind0ws needs to reset from a cache overflow,
but instead an error keeps happening! Or when-"

The word 'when' barely escaped her mouth
before she suddenly went silent.

[Taichi]
"...You're a little neurotic, aren't ya?"

[Nanaca]
"You don't hold a cutie like me captive and
talk to her like that!"

*SMACK*

[Taichi]
"Oooff!"

She slapped me right in the face.
The force of the blow sent me spinning skyward and I
landed on the ground completely horizontal.

[Taichi]
"Ugh... Oogh..."

I was baffled at the comical force this girl
was capable off...
Taichi Keyword:
"Comical Force"
The first theory of ultra-science used in ascension
devices like SCARA EM and aether. Anything physical
which mitigates acceleration.
As a result, a metaphysical, comic-esque outcome
occurs. Statistically more prominent in spirited
childhood friends, it's used to maintain character.

[Nanaca]
"Ah... Sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Such power... As if from the heavens..."

[Nanaca]
"Don't say those kinds of jokes about girls!"

She helped me up.

[Taichi]
"Th-that hurt..."

[Nanaca]
"...Sorry about that."

[Taichi]
"I guess your personality was also handed down from
the heavens, not just your strength."

[Nanaca]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Thanks to your scientific prowess, I was able to
survive such a hit."

[Nanaca]
"I dont get it......"

[Taichi]
"But maybe next time, use a bit more pop."
"Because of the atmosphere of the spin. If you
just wanna take someone off their feet it's extremely
potent, but that's just one way to modulate it."
"In other words, a simple, elegant action
degenerates the moment it's controlled by a
grand-stander."

[Nanaca]
"Are you monologuing, or conversing?"

[Taichi]
"...My bad."

Even I didn't know what I was saying.

[Nanaca]
"I guess it can't be helped,
that's just who you are."

I let out a sigh, half-shocked.

[Nanaca]
"Ah, there's some blood on your cheek."

[Taichi]
"Huh? From just that small show of force?"

[Nanaca]
"Are you still talking about 'force' and all that?"

[Taichi]
"It's just my blood, it's fine."

[Nanaca]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Uh, I'm a bit adverse to blood."

I couldn't recreate the expressions that came
and went on Nanaca's face.
It looked like she was about to cry, then laugh.
However, it certainly wasn't a mixture of the two.
There seemed to be some deep-rooted conflict
behind the expressions.

[Nanaca]
"...Taichi..."

An affected voice escaped her lips.
Her face shrank.
Her eyes began to get misty.
A person who is aware of others' actions is
someone to be cherished.
If I were your average protagonist...
(Hm...?)
Or some such bewilderment would be my only response
to her reaction.
But in reality, the only predictable outcome to the
situation that came to my mind was me up getting
kissed.
With Nanaca's face a mere couple inches away from
mine, I considered what I should say after we kiss.
Maybe I'd ask her for a few more...?
Though the situation was real, the reason it isn't
used in most works of fiction is because it reads as
being too real, even to an amateur like me.
After all, this was a game of reality.
I silently agreed with myself.
And though I did, there was still no kiss?
*sluuurp*

[Taichi]
"..."

It was a kiss without feeling or taste.
A tongue running up the side of one's face
can be called a kiss, I suppose.

[Nanaca]
"If you cover it in spit, it'll heal faster."

[Taichi]
"Whoa-whoah!"

I began smack, smack, smacking the side
of my head!!

[Taichi]
"Don't just jump to conclusions like that! You,
you...! Have you no shame?!"

[Nanaca]
"Why are you doing that to yourself?!"

[Taichi]
"What is reality?! What is friendship?! How can I
think people are so rational?! They've only ever
proven their less-than-human tendencies worldwide!"

[Nanaca]
"Ge-, get a grip...!"

[Taichi]
"I wanna die!"

[Nanaca]
"Hey, hey!"

[Taichi]
"I can't help but be aware of this useless part of
my so-called self."

[Nanaca]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"This hurtful part."
"There are many at Gunjo who are blissfully
unaware."
"I've always been afraid of that. It's a wound that
doesn't heal."
"Being unaware is a danger you can't escape."
"Like a cat that jumps in front of a car."
"Restraint is important. One should have prudence."
"But..."
"Everyday with them has been fun, and I've forgotten
mine. What have I become?"
"I'm..."

Nanaca suddenly moved in close to me.
This time she took me into her arms.

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, as long as you are having fun, it's fine."

There was a vague sense of tenderness in my heart.
Nanaca's scent.
Strangely enough, none of this excited me like
it would have had it been another girl.
The feeling of her embrace was different from
that of Youko's.

[Nanaca]
"I'm happy to hear you say those things.
Very happy."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaca]
"It's not like you have to get stronger to have the
right to live."
"And if you're still weak, that's fine."

[Taichi]
"Even if I'm weak...?"

I knew that.
But what was it that she knew?

[Taichi]
"You..."

[Nanaca]
"Nanaca."

[Taichi]
"Nanaca..."

I had forgotten.
No matter which past experience I imagined,
I had no recollection of that name.
So why did she...?

[Nanaca]
"Feel better?"

[Taichi]
"...Yeah."

She let go of me.
And then she smiled brightly.

[Taichi]
"You..."
"...Do you love me?"

[Nanaca]
"Dummy."

Ack!
She chopped me atop the head.

[Nanaca]
"It's not like that."

She denied it, but then tilted her head and
spoke again.

[Nanaca]
"...But yeah, maybe a little."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, maybe it's a different kind of love than
you imagine."

[Taichi]
"Whaddya mean?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, you're the type who tortured your mother with
perverted pranks ever since you were a child."

[Taichi]
"I didn't have a mother."

[Nanaca]
"Me neither."
"But y'know, maybe your mother would've been happy
for it?"

[Taichi]
"For perverted pranks?"

[Nanaca]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"But a young son petting his mother would be a
shock...no, a fascination."

[Nanaca]
"You really need to disintegrate that harmful part
of yourself."

[Taichi]
"Waaahhh!"

[Nanaca]
"Alright, let's go home."

[Taichi]
"You should come by for a bit. I'll pour you
something warm!"

[Nanaca]
"Hee hee hee, I don't want to be teased, so
I'll just be heading off."

[Taichi]
"I'd definitely, definitely tease you,
if you just come over!"

[Nanaca]
"Sounds too risky!"

Nanaca straddled her bicycle with a flare.
As she bent, I could see up her skirt.
She was wearing non-descript gym shorts.

[Taichi]
"Hmph."

...Wait, gym shorts?
The same deep blue shorts that the women's
liberation movement had eliminated as gym wear
so long ago?!

[Taichi]
"Na-, Nanaca...?"

I began to tremble.
According to rumor, the way they clung to the hips
was superb.

[Nanaca]
"Get that antenna set up lickety-split, okay?"

[Taichi]
"Huh, the antenna?"

That came out of nowhere.

[Nanaca]
"There's potential there, you know!"

The chain of her bike smartly chimed, then began
to turn.
Her tires scraped asphalt, and she was off.

[Taichi]
"...What the hell?"
