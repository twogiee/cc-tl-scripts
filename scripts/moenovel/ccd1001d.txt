It was evening.
Mimi was there, even though we had separated at one
point.
Youko was no where to be found.
She must've left now that Mimi was back.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"..."

Our gazes crossed...
But they didn't really connect.
We sort of just stayed that way for a while.
I stood still, while Mimi moved slowly.
We were both silent.
I couldn't seem to pull Mimi away from the antenna
quite yet.
I had to get through to her heart somehow, though.
It was just scary for me to do that.
Saturday came.
There was one day left...
Only one more day.
I went to the roof early.
Most of the work was finished.
Throwing Youko into the equation was a big deal.
Anyway, now all we had to do was wait.
Saturday...
There was a high probability she'd come.
Then again...

[Taichi]
"Guess she's not coming..."

The door didn't seem to be opening no matter how
long I waited.
Noon eventually came and that's when Mimi arrived.

[Misato]
"Ah... Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"Mimi..."

[Misato]
"Um, actually..."

[Taichi]
"Y-yes?"

[Misato]
"Ah... Well... Nothing, never mind."

[Taichi]
"Huh? Hey, wait!"

I extended my arm. Then I let it drop.
She left so quickly.
Our work was almost complete so it was fine, but...

[Taichi]
"Maybe I messed up."

I found myself at a stalemate.
Maybe I should force her to come to the shrine...

[Taichi]
"No."

There was nothing for either one of us
to gain from that.
I, myself, couldn't be satisfied alone,
and neither could Mimi.
It might be pride talking, but...
We had to have equal exchange.
If only there was a sense of a touch of our feelings.
But even then, how would I put that in order?
I didn't know.
I just waited.
Mimi didn't show up, neither did Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"..."

Time was slipping away.
I was spending it just thinking.
If Tomoki didn't show up, that'd mean he had no
intent on helping.
So...
There were strange sounds.
They were intermittent.
They were anxious sounds...
The sound of destruction.

[Taichi]
"Hn?!"

I sprung up.
I got out of the prefab area.
Tomoki was there.

[Tomoki]
"..."

He was holding a pair of industrial pliers.
The kind that could cut the chain off of bicycles.
The antenna had been destroyed.

[Taichi]
"..."

Most of the damage was done to the wiring and
mechanical parts.
It was completely destroyed.
And it wasn't destroyed out of an outburst of rage.
He used logic and tools to destroy it, in a
calculated way.
A calm kind of destruction.

[Taichi]
"..."

He didn't seem to notice me.
The enthusiasm to build the model
dulled the precautionary sense around it.
I closed in on him silently, then punched him.

[Tomoki]
"Agh...?!"

His surprise went away as soon as his eyes
recognized me.
I looked at the abnormal Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"..."

We exchanged punches without words.
It was more like hand to hand combat.
Then five minutes later...
I had won the fight.
Tomoki never really stood a chance.

[Tomoki]
"Haah, haahh..."

I climbed on top of Tomoki, who was nonresistant,
and began to speak.

[Taichi]
"Do you remember Yusa?"

[Tomoki]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"My neighbor, Yusa. She liked me. Remember she came
to the beach too?"

[Tomoki]
"Oh... That girl..."

[Taichi]
"I always dressed up when I would see her."

[Tomoki]
"Hn?"

[Taichi]
"I always showed my good side, acted properly, and
showed her courtesy."
"And that's why Yusa liked me. I liked her, too."

[Tomoki]
"What's your point..."

[Taichi]
"Is this not betrayal?"

[Tomoki]
"...?!"

Knowing your true self, and yet, trying to hide it.
An act of deceit.
It was something that went against typical acts in
order to show one's true self.
Which was BAD.

[Taichi]
"Eventually, she found out."
"And she now hates me..."

My experiment had ended with a major break off.

[Taichi]
That's the way it was supposed to go, I guess... I
was tricking her, after all.
"Don't you hate betrayals too...?"
"You're the type that can't forgive betrayals,
right?"

[Tomoki]
"But, my sis..."

He spoke while gasping.
He couldn't finish what he was trying to say.
He looked back at me as if he was panicked.

[Taichi]
"I betrayed Yusa, then I had to cut her off."
"The reason she disliked me wasn't because I hid my
ugliness from her."
"It was because my ugliness was rejected by her
physiology."
"Are you sure you can't forgive betrayals?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"What you're doing looks awfully familiar."
"Getting all immersed in a fabricated club..."
"People disappeared, you know?"
"The world of the heart is gone."

It thinned out.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, do you...not get what that's about?"
"Being human isn't about always being right."
"It's whether you accept it or don't accept it."
"If you accept it, accept it without reason."
"That way, you don't have to lie about loving..."

[Tomoki]
"I...wanted to say that too..."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Tomoki]
"I wanted to tell her that as humans we don't need
to be right every single time."

[Taichi]
"I don't know what happened between the two of you."

[Tomoki]
"She sold the family out!"
"She turned our dad in to the police."

[Taichi]
"Police...?"

[Tomoki]
"My sis followed Dad after the divorce."
"I went with Mom."
"Dad told me to follow her too."
"He was in a lot of trouble!"
"He was paying child support to my mom, our
tuition..."
"What else was he supposed to do?!"

Just then it hit me.

[Taichi]
"Did he commit a crime? For money?"

[Tomoki]
"Not for money! Just...necessities to live..."
"But my sis wouldn't forgive him."
"She turned him in!"

That sounded like something Mimi would do...
She was into the law.
She was into following the rules.
Laws and rules that had to be followed.

[Tomoki]
"I mean...she would even sell out family..."
"She... She wants to push her own values
onto other people..."
"And goes crazy if they're not accepted."
"She hurts herself intentionally... Follows people
around..."

[Taichi]
"Hurts herself, like, self-mutilation?"

[Tomoki]
"That is the way she attacks!"
"She attacks herself to attack others!"
"This club is just more of the same. She secludes
herself, immerses herself... It's an attack aimed
directly at us."

Agreed.
Club = Attack.
Ah, that's what it was.

[Tomoki]
"She'll...get crazy... Then she'll get injured."
"She'll get injured on purpose."

I could see a dark flame in Tomoki's eyes.
It was like a fire of hostility.
He began to laugh.
To hate people was comforting.

[Tomoki]
"She sets things up so she can get hurt easily."
"Why do you think I can't play basketball anymore?"

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

[Tomoki]
"I protected her, this is the aftermath."

He spit out hateful words.

[Tomoki]
"What she values the most are...regulations, you
know that right?"
"She...just want people to accept her... She just
wants to make a place that's comfortable for her."

[Taichi]
"Do you really hate her?"

[Tomoki]
"I despise her..."

[Misato]
"Tomoki..."

Mimi came out from behind me.
Even though Tomoki saw her...
He didn't stop.
He was going to lay it all on her.

[Tomoki]
"It doesn't matter how nice you are, Taichi."
"If you go off the rails with her rules,
then you're done."
"She doesn't care about anyone."

[Misato]
"Tomoki... I..."

[Tomoki]
"There are no more rules that need to be followed
now that people are gone."
"So... All that's left is for you to fail."

The world was the heart's patchwork.
The rules were in ruins.

[Misato]
"Hey... Tomoki... I..."

Her tearful voice was going right through me and
towards Tomoki.

[Tomoki]
"Shut up!"

Tomoki yelled towards me.
I was a useful wall.

[Tomoki]
"You're nothing but a traitor!"
"Dad covered for you, didn't he?"
"Mom tried to leave you and he covered you!"
"And you betrayed him... Why? I don't get it...
I don't get it at all."

He began to cry.
Just look...
You love your sister from the bottom of your heart.
But his tearful face couldn't be seen by Mimi.

[Tomoki]
"Dad has to redeem himself for a long time now..."
"If...you're so precious to yourself..."
"You should just live on your own."

[Taichi]
"..."

Those last few words carried quite an impact.
That's right.
The heart is a thing of ego.
Egos tend to have the power to completely paint out
the boundaries of the heart.
There was a countless number of hexes for burying
the world. The heart was one of those.
It all had to be the same size.
It all had to be the same shape.
If not...you'd end up being at the receiving end of
external pressures.
Most couldn't handle it.
But when one could...
They became a monster capable of hurting,
destroying, and indulging its surrounding forever.
They'd end up pushing away those around them.

[Misato]
"Uh... Tomoki... So..."

She tried to laugh a bit, but ended up giving a
half-smile.

[Misato]
"I..."

She flashed another half-smile.

[Misato]
"Ah..."

Then she overdid it and ended up dragging her smile
downward.
The moment I became conscious again and the moment
Mimi kicked the ground was simultaneous.
She ran away.
I stood myself up...
And put my hand out to Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"So Mimi sold her dad out to the authorities."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, that's right."
"She destroyed the family twice."

He said in a flat tone.
This whole time he could only place blame. He seemed
to apathetic about it.

[Tomoki]
"The first time...it was my injury. This...really
fed my mom up."

My mom saw her for the selfish daughter she was.

[Tomoki]
"My dad covered for her until the very end."
"And we were split into two."

He fell silent for a moment.

[Tomoki]
"Which was fine. My mom was going through
a nervous breakdown..."

I should have kept my distance.

[Tomoki]
"But...then she did the same to Dad..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah... Right."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"I totally understand how Mimi feels."

[Tomoki]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"You're pretty grounded...so you may not
understand, but..."
"It doesn't have anything to do with will."
"We are automatic is all."

[Tomoki]
"Automatic... I... I don't understand..."

[Taichi]
"When situations like that occur, that's the way you
have to respond."
"That's the way it is."
"It doesn't matter how close you are to someone or
how much you love them."
"The middle of the brain makes it like that."
"It can't be controlled with reason."
"That's why...you hurt them, even though you love
them... It happens."

Sometimes, we all lose our way.
You want to touch, even if your fingers are blades.

[Taichi]
"And people like us generally hate ourselves."

Tomoki was speechless...for a little while.

[Tomoki]
"You...too?"

[Taichi]
"Who do you think I am?"
"I scored over 80, you know?"

I chuckled.

[Tomoki]
"But you're fine, Taichi... You seem to be doing
well...no?"

[Taichi]
"Acting."
"It's all an act."
"I really loved Yusa."
"But... I knew she was getting bullied...
Knowing that... I still pushed her down."

[Tomoki]
"!"

[Taichi]
"My sense of reasoning understood that it was the
wrong thing to do. But I couldn't stop myself."
"I really can't control it."
"Don't forget, Tomoki."
"Anyone attending Gunjo is hurting someone
while hurting themselves."

[Tomoki]
"..."

A gust of wind blew past us.
It was like the dry air that passed through
wastelands.
The kind that made you feel chills.
Tomoki seemed to be freezing from my view.

[Taichi]
"If you really hate Mimi that much, I guess there's
nothing that can be done about it."
"Your dad probably forgives Mimi."

[Tomoki]
"...!"

[Taichi]
"It's reasonable to respect each other... But you
can't, so that's just how it's going to be, right?"
"It gets tangled because you put human relations
and interests together."
"You just have to love one another. Is that wrong?"
"Love in just one direction is fine. Just like the
love your dad has for Mimi."

[Tomoki]
"I..."

[Taichi]
"Take your time and think about it."
"The answer only lies within you."
"When you have your answer...come to the shrine
on the mountain tomorrow morning."

[Tomoki]
"Shrine...?"

[Taichi]
"At noon. Mimi and I will plan to be there."
"If there's something you want to say, then come to
the shrine at noon tomorrow."

He didn't say anything in response.
I went after Mimi and left Tomoki behind with a
troubled look on his face.
Where else would she go other than the rooftop?
This was a first.
I had to convince her...
Even if that meant I had to show her
my own wounds...
Her house was shut.

[Taichi]
"Helllooo."

The doors were locked.
I could unlock the front door, but...
I sharpened my senses.
I felt like I could sense Mimi's presence inside.
I sensed the heat lurking in my abdomen.
If it burst, then I'd become uncontrollable.
I wondered.
I contemplated.
But then I just ended up going home.
Nighttime was the best time to mope.
Wounds were meant to be healed in the darkness.

[Taichi]
"It's quiet..."

I exclaimed out my window.
If I failed to capture Mimi...
Then I had to do it over again.
The opportunity for...contact increased.
I recognized that weakness in me.
I hit my face.

[Taichi]
"Do it."

Quickly.
Before I created a lethal memory.
I got in bed and calmed myself down.
I needed to calm my heart from the fight I
had earlier...
To cool down my low capacity senses.

[Taichi]
"Okay."

My attempt to calm down worked.

[Taichi]
"Let's go."

I looked around the rooftop, just in case.
She wasn't there.
Maybe she was still at the house.
So I went all the way there.
The yard was filled with weeds.
They had grown tall in just a week.
Maybe Mimi wasn't taking care of the yard during her
dad's absence.
Why?
Because it must've been tough.
I went around back.
It was locked as well, but the lock was a pretty old
school one.
I inserted the pick into the keyhole and moved the
tumbler inside.
There was a reassuring click.

[Taichi]
"Hello."

I made sure to say it loud enough since I wasn't
here to surprise anyone.
I took my shoes off and stepped inside.
There was no one on the first floor.
So I moved on to the second.
There were only two rooms.
One was empty.
There was only an empty shelf and a bed.
Which meant...

[Taichi]
"Hey... I'm here."

I said next to the last remaining room.
Even though the location was different, my actions
were the same as always.
I tended to follow Mimi about.
That's all I wanted to do.

[Misato]
"What do you want?"

I finally got a response.

[Taichi]
"I came to talk."

[Misato]
"I want you to leave."

[Taichi]
"Now now."

[Misato]
"Kurosu..."

She called me by my last name.

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

[Misato]
"There's no more club."
"Just live as you please."

I could sense an air of disinterest in her voice.

[Taichi]
"I'm already living as I please..."
"To a point, of course."
"I like talking to you, Mimi."
"So won't you let me talk to you for a bit?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I heard about you and your dad."
"How should I put it... Well, generally speaking, I
thought the whole story was pretty extreme."
"Tomoki seems to think so too."
"I'm sorry if that's not the case."
"But you really love your dad, don't you Mimi?"

I could tell she was holding her breath.

[Misato]
"Why...do you think that?"

She finally responded.
Our conversation finally started.

[Taichi]
"Because you're a person of rules."
"Especially when it comes to those close to you, the
people you feel for, and those you look up to."
"You talked to me for that same reason, right?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"If that person deviates from the rules..."
"You'd accuse them... Even if they were close to
you."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It's almost like teasing someone
because you like them."
"I think humans are either interested
or uninterested."
"And whatever the reasoning is happens to just be an
afterthought."

[Misato]
"I don't know..."

[Taichi]
"Loving someone and being a part of something
are two different things, right?"
"You wouldn't go to it if you had no interest."
"Normally, if you like someone, you'd keep an
appropriate distance."
"But we are a little broken..."
"We break and hurt people, even if we don't
want to."
"That's not denying your love for someone."
"Rather, because you love them... You want them to
look at you."
"You wanted your dad to hurt you."
"That's why you did something to hurt him."
"That was a means of communicating
between you and your dad."
"So...how's that for some detective work?"

[Misato]
"It's all wrong."
"You should close down your detective business."

[Taichi]
"Pure lies."
"Why are you holding on to your cell phone?"

[Misato]
"Just out of habit."

[Taichi]
"You're waiting for a call, aren't you?"
"From your dad."

[Misato]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"If he called, what would you talk to him about?"
"Like how embezzlement is wrong?"

[Misato]
"No!"

I knew that.

[Misato]
"I... I just...!"

[Taichi]
"Just?"

[Misato]
"I want to apologize... I just want to apologize..."

[Taichi]
"Say you're sorry?"

[Misato]
"To say I'm sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Crimes are wrong. You did the right thing.
But you want to apologize?"

[Misato]
"B-b-because...!"
"I wish I just didn't know... If I hadn't
noticed...then, then we could've been happy...!"
"Of course I love them. My dad that protected me,
my mom, Tomoki too...everyone...!"
"But now, I can't even apologize to them..."
"I destroyed everything... Then it all vanished...!"
"I didn't want to do anything. I didn't want to
think. There was nothing I could do to change the
situation."
"But I'm...at my limit."
"I want to die...right now... I want to destroy
myself... But..."
"I'm scared to die..."
"I don't want to die alone..."
"So... I..."
"I feel sick... Living...makes me lose my mind."

[Taichi]
"Do you want me to make it easier for you?"

[Misato]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"I'll make it easier for you, Mimi."

[Misato]
"What are you saying...?"

[Taichi]
"I have something similar to what rules are to you."
"I think you may have noticed it by now."

[Misato]
"Pekke, you... You break..."

[Taichi]
"Right."

My impulses were as innocent as those of a cat
playing.

[Misato]
"You'll do that to me...?"

[Taichi]
"Kindly."

We said all of this while separated by her door.
I felt something even if I couldn't sense body
warmth.

[Misato]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"If that's true..."
"Then... I don't..."
"Don't what...?"

The door opened silently.
We both quietly walked up the trail.
There was no need to talk.

[Taichi]
"This way."

[Misato]
"Yes..."

I only needed to check occasionally to make sure.
She followed silently.
I looked at my watch.
Good timing.
We finally arrived. The scene was just as expected.
The shrine was the in shape of Kiri, covered with a
shroud.

[Taichi]
"That reminds me..."

I began to talk about something unrelated.
Seriously, it was out of the blue.
And Mimi put on an expression of round-eyed wonder,
vaguely making sounds of comprehension.
I wanted to wait until the scarlet sky came.
Our last few minutes of interaction were spent on
random chit-chat.

[Taichi]
"Well...time to begin."
"This way, over here."

I grabbed her soft hands and guided her.
Her fingertips were cold.
Maybe she was scared?
I had her stand on a suitable spot.

[Taichi]
"Stand here."

[Misato]
"Umm..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Misato]
"This may not be something I should say, but..."
"I'm really scared..."

[Taichi]
"I'm sure you are."

After that, Mimi was unable to utter another word.
She was confused at this bizarre situation.

[Taichi]
"You've had to hold your heart and live in a world
filled with people."

[Misato]
"With people...?"
"The people...are all..."

[Taichi]
"Shhh."

I covered her mouth.
Someone else was there.
I heard rustling through the grass and footsteps...
Then they started running.
Whoever they were, they shouldn't have been running.
We had to nip our conversation in the bud.
I gazed into Mimi's eyes one last time...
To keep her embedded in my memory.
And then the world started to disassemble.
The density of the atmosphere started to alter
and the sky darkened.

[Misato]
"Is that the sunset?"

She stepped back.

[Taichi]
"Thanks for inviting me to the club, Mimi."

She stiffened up.

[Taichi]
"Even if that was you pushing your values onto
me...it still made me happy."
"Thanks for showing interest in me."
"I won't forget you. You, your worlds,
and your memory."

[Misato]
"Please, don't make it painful."

Her shoulders began to shiver and her voice
quivered.
The sight made me want to hug her.
I turned around and created some distance
between us.

[Misato]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry... I lied when I said I'd make it easier."
"You have to live even if you suffer, Mimi."
"I won't be there, but..."

I waved to her...

[Taichi]
"Good-bye Mimi, it was fun."

I closed my eyes right when Mimi tried to say
something.
She was gone when I opened them.
I felt instantly exhausted.
Like my chest had been hollowed out.

[Taichi]
"Haahh..."

But there were no tears.
I was feeling a mix of emotions, some incomplete.
It made me sick.
Then Tomoki suddenly arrived.

[Tomoki]
"Where...is my sis?"

It was abrupt.
He was in a hurry.
He had run all the way here and was sweating
buckets.

[Taichi]
"Over there."

[Tomoki]
"What were you two doing?"

[Taichi]
"Gathering some edible plants."

[Tomoki]
"You brought her out here?"

[Taichi]
"That's right, hurry."
"She's in a lot of trouble, so help her."

His expression changed.

[Tomoki]
"Which way?"

[Taichi]
"There, over there!"

[Tomoki]
"She's not there...?"

The coordinates lined up.

[Taichi]
"Tell Yusa that I'm sorry."

[Tomoki]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"Good night, sis-lover."
"Make an immoral effort..."

And so Tomoki was sent back.

[Misato]
"Hmm...? Pekke?"
"..."
"Umm?"

[Tomoki]
"Sis..."

[Misato]
"Tomoki? What are you doing here..."

[Tomoki]
"Let's talk."
"There's a lot I want to talk about..."

[Misato]
"Tomoki... Why did you..."

[Tomoki]
"H-huh?"
"The radio..."

[Misato]
"Huh? There's...signal?"
"Oh..."

[Tomoki]
"Is that your phone?"

[Misato]
"It's ringing... Someone's calling..."

[Tomoki]
"Who is it?"

[Misato]
"It's...Dad."

[Tomoki]
"So that means...?"

[Misato]
"I don't know..."
"It's like...we were in some long nightmare..."
"Hello?"

[Taichi]
"Hahahah."

I did it.
Mimi and Tomoki were no longer here.
I'd never see them again.
That pained me...
All that remained were memories.
So now what...
I leaned against the shrine and closed my eyes...
And then got wrapped up by a strange, indescribable
feeling of dizziness.
It felt like the world was moving and making me see
illusions.
I couldn't stop thinking of those two.
My consciousness began to fade.
My body and its functions felt stuck in a state of
heavy suspension.
Human perception couldn't completely observe this
process of disassembly.
The world was disassembled just like that...
And it was impossible to know when it'd end.
All I knew was that I'd continue to live in this
reality...
That the battle would continue, as always.
Until next week-
