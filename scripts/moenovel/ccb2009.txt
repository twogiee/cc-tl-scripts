[Taichi]
"Ah! I'm so tired!"

[Touko]
"Thanks, for doing everything."

Jeez!
I was angry, so I yelled at Touko.

[Taichi]
"You're from a martial arts family so you should be
capable of physical work! You're just acting all
innocent to avoid working! Arg!"

[Touko]
"With these dainty, thin arms? Are you stupid?"

She looked like she was hurt somehow.
She was a delicate one who melts away if you were
kind to her so I decided that I wouldn't show her
any kindness at all.

[Taichi]
"I want to take a bath."

[Touko]
"You can take a bath?!"

Her face seemed to shimmer.
However.

[Taichi]
"Can't take the luxury. Water's too precious."

[Touko]
"Jeez..."

[Taichi]
"Is what I wanted to say, but yes, you can take a
bath."

[Touko]
"Really?!"

For her to get that excited...

[Taichi]
"Does this mean you haven't bathed at all?"

[Touko]
"N-no!"

[Taichi]
"Really?"

I crept up to her.

[Touko]
"Wh-what?"

She crept away.

[Taichi]
"I have a smell fetish, so let me check you."

[Touko]
"What? Stop it! What the heck is a smell fetish?
Go away!"

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh."

I smiled like a devil, and crept toward my prey
in the corner of the room.

[Taichi]
"What lovely poison has your body excreted
for me to smell?"

[Touko]
"Eek!"

Her composure turned pale and crumbled.

[Touko]
"Stay away! If you come any closer..."

[Taichi]
"What if I do? What could a defenseless girl like you
do against me? I'm Taichi, from the Karade club!"

I asked Touko with a perverted,
yet gentlemanly voice.

[Touko]
"If you're to sniff my smell..."

*clink*
The sound of a sword grabbed.

[Touko]
"I'll slash you."

[Taichi]
"Gyaa!"
"Is that the magical sword, Harakirimaru?!"

I thought I kept weapons from her,
but she somehow brought one!
Maybe she teleported it here?

[Touko]
"How rude!"
"It's my beloved sword, Imakotetsu."
"I study under the Musou Jikiden Eishin school...
No rank, though."

[Taichi]
"None?"

[Touko]
"How would I have one?!"
"But this is a good sword so it can cut well!"

[Taichi]
"But isn't that against the Iai rules of swordplay?"

The rules of Iai which stated don't slash and don't
get slashed, instead, force yourself to find
peace...

[Touko]
"If I'll

[Taichi]
"Wait! Wait!"

I suddenly sounded like a total coward.

[Taichi]
"Okay, got it. I'll stop with bugging you.
Just calm yourself down."

[Touko]
"Ugh..."

Her eyes glared at me.

[Touko]
"You won't try to sniff me?"

[Taichi]
"I won't."

If I did, she'd kill me.

[Touko]
"But..."

[Taichi]
"There's a house two doors down with the bathtub
full of water. We can use that."

[Touko]
"..."

Touko slowly paced to the door.
She didn't let down her guard. A true warrior.

[Touko]
"..."

She backed slowly into the hallway,
and slid to the right.

[Taichi]
"See you later..."

[Touko]
"..."

She disappeared to the corridor.
30 minutes later.

[Touko]
"I'm back!"

She looked very happy.
Her urge to kill me was washed away,
and she sauntered over to me.

[Taichi]
"Welcome back..."

[Touko]
"Jeez, Taichi, you smell like sweat!"

Did this bitch want to die?

[Touko]
"At least wipe your sweat off, yuck."

[Taichi]
"I have that fetish, and you not letting me fulfill
it is almost like sexual harassment."

[Touko]
"Why are you angry?"

[Taichi]
"Cuz you made me angry!"
"Whatever... I'm taking a bath."

[Touko]
"See ya."

When I came back, my room was tidied up.

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Touko]
"Welcome back, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"What is this?"

[Touko]
"It's clean, right?"
"We're living together, so I have to clean up."

[Taichi]
"You're just like Aunt Mutsumi."

I still shook with anger.

[Touko]
"No shock at this room being as dirty as you."

She fixed her hair up like a princess again.
She gave off that "I'm better" air.
Well, nobody cared about all that.

[Taichi]
"Well, it does look better...wait!"

I looked under my bed.
They were gone!

[Taichi]
"My secret reading materials!"

I first looked on my desk.
Why did women love to touch stuff?
They were gone.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Kirihara, where are my books
about how to make nude drawings?"

I made a cheap excuse.

[Touko]
"Oh, you mean those pictures you had?"

[Taichi]
"Right."

[Touko]
"I burned them."

[Taichi]
"My ladies!"

I froze up straight and fell over.
I got up.

[Taichi]
"You burned them! You didn't throw them away,
but you BURNED them?"

[Touko]
"I kind of felt I had to after looking at them."

[Taichi]
"You burned my study materials!
What are you? The Third Reich?!"

[Touko]
"I thought you didn't need them, since they were
under your bed. They were pretty sexual too...
All those nude women."

[Taichi]
"I told you, they're art books!"

[Touko]
"Oh, really?"

[Taichi]
"Haven't you heard that art is the pure thing at the
root of all humanity? You should be ashamed because
we men fall in love with our own creations!"
"And you'll regret. You'll regret because you'll go
to hell and burn, just like those precious books you
burnt! You're an enemy to humanity itself!"

I was so ticked off, all the while pointing at Touko.

[Touko]
"Say whatever you want, but I also hesitated."
"I mean...looking at them, really made me angry."
"I heard that stuff like this was popular among the
lower classes."

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

[Touko]
"I've always been in an all-girl's school
so I don't know, but I heard guys look at that...
And then fantasize."

[Taichi]
"Wh-Wha?"

[Touko]
"Not even dirty videos...but for someone to get off
from books like that..."
"It doesn't make sense too. When you love someone,
you shouldn't look at stuff like that."
"Yeah, not good."

[Taichi]
"Don't philosophize to yourself."
"Tch! Whatever."

[Touko]
"Well, it's over now."

This girl sucked.

[Taichi]
"Damn, you suck."

I was as honest as a saint.

[Taichi]
"So why do you know about dirty videos, anyway?"

[Touko]
"You let me borrow a 'musical' that turned out
being a porn tape!"

[Taichi]
"Yikes!"

[Touko]
"I watched it with my whole family!"

[Taichi]
"I totally forgot, but it was just as what I
intended. I'm glad I lent it."

[Touko]
"There's nothing to be glad about!"

[Taichi]
"It's because you said you had a video player."
"I transfered it all to data, so I didn't need it.
Then you said you had a video player."

[Touko]
"It's because my father watched a lot of movies."

It's her father then.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, there's no reason for you to burn my things.
You have no right to do so!"

[Touko]
"Hey, are you hungry?"

[Taichi]
"You were totally not listening."

[Touko]
"What should we make? Potatoes again?"

[Taichi]
"No, today is..."

Right when we were about to talk about dinner...

[Voice]
"Heeeey!"

There was a voice outside.

[Touko]
"Hey, is that Tomoki?"

[Taichi]
"I don't want to explain anything, so keep quiet."

[Touko]
"Hey, can I see the other rooms?"

[Taichi]
"Help yourself."

I went downstairs.
I got stuff from Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"Oh...food."

[Tomoki]
"Make sure to eat responsibly."

[Taichi]
"Thanks for helping with the club. It's rough, but
helping others makes you feel better even though
it's for nothing."

[Tomoki]
"It definitely keeps you distracted."

I went back to my room.
Touko wasn't there.

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh."
"Heeh heeh."

I let out a spontaneous laugh.

[Taichi]
"This is indeed a clean room. It's refreshing."
"I got a clean room in exchange for all my porn
under the bed... But Touko, you're naive."

Those were the dummy porn books! (Woohoo!)
I had the real stuff hidden elsewhere.
Seemed like she didn't touch my collection
of cosplay girls in the closet.
I guess Touko's super PTA-bility wasn't that great.
Taichi Keyword:
"PTA-bility"
The ability to find dirty books like a PTA group.
I had a bunch of women's underwear hidden
in my older sister's drawers.
I had it hidden away like leaves from a tree.

[Taichi]
"And still one group of my REAL porn is...hah!"

Even a super trained ninja wouldn't notice!
Look, a secret safe buried into my wall!
I've created a private space
with revolutionary building technology!
I built it when Youko helped me make some money
in the FOREX markets!
An incombustible, hidden safe:
"Invulnerable Nirvana"!
*Invulnerable Nirvana: Product name
I flipped open the part of the wall it was buried in.
Slid it to the right.
The door to the safe appeared.
The code written nowhere.
The code that only my mind knows.
Even someone like Lupin the Third couldn't open it.
9991.
Clack, and the lock was opened.
I got the code from my favorite puzzle game.
Lvl. 999 was the hardest puzzle and I solved it all
by myself. It was pretty memorable, thus, making the
code 9991.
It took a little wit, and it's harder to guess than
a birthday.
I put my finger in the crack, and opened it.
It was empty...

[Taichi]
"My secret stash!!"

Arrrgggggh!
I convulsed.

[Taichi]
"Graaaaahhhhhrgh!"

Something came out of my mouth.
*Something: ectoplasm

[Touko]
"What is that coming out of your mouth?!"

[Taichi]
"Wha...?"

I came back to my senses.

[Taichi]
"Gwooooah!"

I tried to wipe away with both hands the stuff that
came from my mouth.

[Touko]
"You sucked it back in..."

[Taichi]
"I'm...back!"

I made a heroic pose.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara! What did you do with the things inside?
I mean, how did you even find it?"

[Touko]
"How...I felt a strange aura...and found the safe...
Then I just guessed the code."

Genius PTA-bility?!

[Taichi]
"What about the insides?"

[Touko]
"As I said..."
"I burned them."

[Taichi]
"All?"

[Touko]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"All?"

I asked again.

[Touko]
"Y-yes."

[Taichi]
"Y-y-you..."

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"This small empty space comprised one part of my
ego!"

[Touko]
"There was a girl...tied up...and in swimsuits..."
"I thought it was weird, so I made sure they burned."
"Relax. You don't need them anyway."

She smiled.

[Touko]
"If you need a nude model...I can do it for you."

[Taichi]
"Whaaaahhahahahahah..."

She didn't get it.
She didn't get it at all.
My soul! (Soul!)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@My soul! (Soul!)
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@It burned! (Burned!)
Dust, to dust! (My soul!)
@@@@@@Burning, burning, my soul.
I'll never hold you again!

@@@@@@@@@@@Your soul too! (Soul!)

[Taichi]
"Good bye!"

I rapped this as cool as I could, screamed,
and passed out.
My consciousness, gone.
I recalled this time last year.
