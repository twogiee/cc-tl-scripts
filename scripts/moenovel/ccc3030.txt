And so Sunday came.
The weather was fine.
It was a gray area that wasn't in the journals.
I had no idea how the world would end on this day.
One week... It went by so fast.
The days for which I had struggled to make Kiri mine
had finally come.
And yet...
It was fortunate that we were able to reform club.
If I were to continue going over the notebooks,
I was sure I would find a clue in that reformation.
I longed for those happy occasions,
many times and in many ways.
In this box garden that was beyond saving.

[Taichi]
"Still no one around."

I looked over the area.
There was the pipe tent and various parts
spread across the spacious rooftop.
The hastily-constructed antenna.
The blue sky was free of any radio
or electro-magnetic waves.

[Kiri]
"So blue..."

There was Kiri, who looked up to the sky.

[Taichi]
"Not a cloud up there."

[Kiri]
"Yes."

Yet, Kiri's face seemed to wear those clouds instead.
We lined up against the fence together.
We stayed there in silence.
But before long...

[Misato]
"Good morning."

Everyone began to show up.

[Tomoki]
"Okay..."

He never spoke a word to Mimi, but Tomoki came as
well.

[Taichi]
"Thanks... When should we start?"

[Misato]
"Well, we hadn't really decided on a time, so now is
fine."

[Sakuraba]
"The DJ."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, the DJ...who'll broadcast?"

No one raised a hand to volunteer.

[Taichi]
"How about you, Mimi?"

[Misato]
"Huh, me? I can't do it, nope nope, not possible,
I'll trip on my words or something!"

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"Hrmph...?"

Miki was in the middle of tearing a strip of beef
jerky.
A less than pretty sight.
She's out of the picture...

[Taichi]
"Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"Sure, how much will you pay me?"

[Taichi]
"..."

This was no time to talk about money.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Do you think I can give such a logical speech?"

[Taichi]
"...I'm glad you understand yourself."
"All right then... Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

Her face changed color.
She instantly began to sweat with discomfort.

[Taichi]
"DJ Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Ah, no, I couldn't possibly, I'm no good at
speaking to an audience."

[Taichi]
"Say what? The whole human race is gone. What
audience are you talking about?"

[Tomoki]
"Where's your hope?!"

[Taichi]
"Oof."

I took a chop to the head.

[Kiri]
"I can't, I won't, I'm not... I'll come out strange."

Kiri was completely caught up in her fear.

[Taichi]
"I wanna see what strange Kiri looks like."

I took her by the hand.

[Kiri]
"No!"

I took her by the ankle.

[Taichi]
"I can see your panties."

[Kiri]
"?!"

Kiri hastily forced down her skirt.
Kiri immediately collapsed.
I took advantage and dragged her along.

[Taichi]
"Congrats on your big debut!"

[Kiri]
"Somebody save me!"

Not having it, huh?
I let Kiri go.
She quickly ran and hid behind Miki.
Her mentality was like a small little animal.

[Taichi]
"Fine then... I'll do it."

There was no one else who would.

[Tomoki]
"Whenever you're ready."

What should I say?
Nothing came to mind.
It was a pointless SOS.
But no one felt that way.
It felt like my own body was moved as if it wasn't mine.
I sat in the chair and took the mic in hand.
I acted with hardly a thought.
To be honest, when have I acted with thought?
It must be the connection with these people around
me, that made me this way.

[Taichi]
"Ummm... Is anyone out there who can hear this
broadcast?"
"This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club."
"Is anyone left out there...?"
"This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club,
we have eight surviving members."
"We have eight survivors."

People are important.
Family and friends are important.
For as long as you're still human.

[Taichi]
"We're all in good health."

If you don't mind not being human no longer, then
living in isolation is a possibility.
But I was happy to still be human.
I'd always rather be a creature of reason than
instinct.
Then I could have been a completely harmless being.
But I couldn't.
I didn't have enough contact or the connections with
people.

[Taichi]
"Um..."

Family.
They were gone...
In this box garden paradise, my companions had
become as faint as the atmosphere around me.
I couldn't even remember their faces...
My encounter with Youko.
...She never treated me as a stranger.
The Shinkawas.
They forced me to learn the dangers of humanity.
I never had contact with others during my childhood,
that most sensitive of times.

[Taichi]
"I have a sin from the past which I have to 
confess about."

The sound of a bell rang through the air.
I could feel six pairs of eyes focused on me.

[Taichi]
"I've...let a friend die."

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi...?"

[Taichi]
"They didn't die by my hands... But I still let him
die."
"That friend was a person, who hurt me in the past."
"He had lost his memory, and he appeared in front of
me."
"He acted as if his sins in the past were lost with
his memories."
"I didn't realize who he was at first. Since it was
something that happened long time ago."

The atmosphere around me changed.
I could feel the questions and uncertainties from
those six pairs of eyes.
It should settle down soon.
Even though the atmosphere would become bitter.

[Taichi]
"But then one day, I came to know the truth
in a flash of brutal clarity."
"To be honest, the scars I received from, shouldn't
have influenced me now."
"I, Taichi Kurosu, is aiming to be a young adult
that can accept anything."
"However..."

Kiri shifted uncomfortably.
She brought her hand to her mouth.

[Taichi]
"But I wasn't able to see that person
as a friend anymore after I found out."

[Kiri]
"Ugh."

[Miki]
"Kiri...?"

[Taichi]
"He became more like a thing in my eyes."
"This feeling I had for him was different from not
being able to forgive him."
"Definitely though, my value of him changed."
"No...it didn't change... He became nothing to me."
"I lost interest in him."
"When he got his memories back, he begged for my
forgiveness."
"If he hadn't asked me to forgive him,
things may have ended differently."

[Kiri]
"...!"

[Taichi]
"There is no way of changing the past."
"It's either you accept the sins or despite them. I
feel these are the only two ways to deal with it."
"His sin itself...wasn't much of anything, really."
"I should have just take it as a joke and kept being
friends with him."

[Kiri]
"Taichi..."

Tears.
Tears...huh.
That's something, I don't have.

[Taichi]
"Why couldn't I just tell him to don't worry about
it... I think about it constantly."
"It's because, I'm twisted."
"It's because my mind is twisted."
"I lack sense."
"But in order to have sense, other people are
needed."
"Without conflict, how do people grow?"
"But...I hurt and I lost a friend who gave me that
conflict."
"This is...my dilemma."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Even if memories are lost, what happened in the
past stays."
"But should I be hurt, or should I hurt him..."
"...We still could of stayed as good friends."

[Kiri]
*sob*

She cried.

[Misato]
"Sakura..."

Everyone probably have already realized what was
going on.
What happened between Yutaka and I.
No one spoke out.
No one was stopping my broadcast.

[Taichi]
"I'm scared of what I am..."
"But I can't kill myself. It's not an option."
"I thought it would be much better if everyone else
were gone instead."
"Whenever I was suffering,
that thought would run through my head."
"A week passed since humans have disappeared from
the face of the Earth."
"I've often wondered if any of this was my fault."

[Misato]
"..."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Since I am worthless after all."
"And, I want to show my gratitude or not, to my
fellow friends who always stayed by my side know
what kind of person I am."

[Sakuraba]
"Which is it?"

A rare quip from Sakuraba.

[Tomoki]
"Double-negatives don't make it very clear."

Tomoki following up like usual.

[Taichi]
"...For yourself"
"Even if it's for selfish reasons, we should care
for those around us."
"For the sake of being... A slightly less horrible
person everyday."
"I still have friends."
"What bound us was our pain-filled pasts."
"They were ugly, unbearable experiences for each of
us."
"Even still, we understood that people needed each
other."
"That's why I believe, that there must still be
people out there, hearing this broadcast."
"Our location is..."

I also stated how to contact us.
Okay, that should do.
I guess I talked enough.
...What else is there to talk about?

[Taichi]
"This has been the eight survivors of the Gunjo
Gakuin Broadcasting Club."
"Until next week."

I finished.
I let out a huge sigh.
And then I heard an applause.
First from Mimi. Then everyone else followed the suit.

[Taichi]
"..."

It felt sincere, and I felt good about it.
At the same time, wave of embarrassment washed over
me.
I scratched my cheek and bore the brunt of their
killing kindness.

[Misato]
"All right, well done."

[Taichi]
"Phew..."

[Sakuraba]
"Next week, huh?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, well... It's just a thing people say."

[Tomoki]
"It's nothing to worry about."

[Sakuraba]
"For sure..."

[Miki]
"You were so cool!"

Miki took out her disposable camera and took a bunch
of pictures.

[Taichi]
"Knock it off...!"

[Miki]
"Don't be shy, smile for the camera!"

[Taichi]
"So annoying...!"

And then...

[Kiri]
"Taichi..."

Kiri stood up.
I wondered what she would say.
I waited anxiously.

[Kiri]
"Good..."

Good?

[Kiri]
"Good...work."

She lowered her head.

[Taichi]
"..."

My emotions welled up within me.
I was unable to form any words.
So mysterious, yet relieving, to have such a
sensation.
I felt that my heart was overflowing.
Just a little though.

[Taichi]
"Thanks..."

All of a sudden, the sky began to turn pale.

[Taichi]
"...!"

Ahhh, why now...
Things had suddenly become terrifying.
I had to keep my cool though.
I held on to Kiri.
I fell to my knees and buried my face in her
abdomen.

[Kiri]
"Ahh! Wh-what's wrong?!"

[Miki]
"Wow, that's a pretty bold move..."

[Misato]
"Lascivious conduct suspension..."

[Sakuraba]
"I don't think such a term exists, Club President."

[Tomoki]
"We all knew Taichi was a perv."

[Taichi]
"I lost my tension! Provide me comfort!"

I was in absolute terror.
I feared losing myself.
My last save point was Saturday night.
The joy, the confession, and my small amount of
growth today...it would all be for nothing.
I was scared. Terrified. Petrified.

[Kiri]
"Taichi...are you crying?"

[Miki]
"...Kiri."

My ears rang.
Though my eyes were buried in Kiri's chest, I can
see that the world was gradually turning white.
Turning white...

[Taichi]
"...Damn it."

Those were my last words.
