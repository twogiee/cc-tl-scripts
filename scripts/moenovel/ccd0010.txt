"Phew..."

I tried moving around a bit.
It was a Sunday, and we had club.
This was best in order to have a happy ending on the
final day of the world.
However, uneasiness filled the air...
It would take serious work to have everyone
reconcile.
I headed to the shrine.
There sat the vast collection of journals.
It would be impossible to read them all.
If I were to have my way (in a manner of speaking)
with Miki, Kiri would be off the table.
It was great to have new information.
If I gathered too much though, I wouldn't have
enough time to analyze it.
It was quite the dilemma.
I racked my brain over it until the dead of night.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

A light had appeared behind me.
Someone was holding up a flashlight.
It was Youko.

[Taichi]
"Ngah... It's so bright..."

[Youko]
"You probably shouldn't be reading so much in the
dark, it's bad for your eyes."

[Taichi]
"R-right... My bad."

[Youko]
"Did you find anything?"

[Taichi]
"Nope. It feels like I'm caught in an unsolvable
mystery."

[Youko]
"Hmm, that's too bad."

[Taichi]
"Hey Youko, about this notebook..."

I began to ask, but then immediately thought it
better to shut my mouth.
Could I confide in her?

[Taichi]
"Actually, never mind. Let's head back."

I stood up.
And left most of the journals within the shrine.
But I kept a number of volumes on hand. As much as I
could possibly read, anyway.

[Youko]
"Is it all right if I go back with you?"

[Taichi]
"You always keep an eye on me, don't you?"

[Youko]
"I'm sorry..."
