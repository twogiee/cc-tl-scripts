I lay down on the bed.
I should probably have gotten the cooking done while
it was still light outside...
But, I just wasn't feeling up to it.
I couldn't get myself to move.
...It had been three days. Three days living out
what happened in the journals. I hadn't been able
to help anyone.
Reconciliation.
Everyone in the broadcasting club going through club
activities together.
Healthy, bright, fun radio broadcasting.
The notes didn't tell me how to achieve it.
I couldn't tell what I needed to do to reach the
outcome I wanted.

[Taichi]
"Thursday, Friday, Saturday..."

How many days were left?
I shouldn't have thought about it.
About the world ending.

[Taichi]
"Uggghhh..."

Gloom and doom.
A growing resentment towards the reality of this
strange world.
And there were only three or four days left.

[Taichi]
"What can I even do... With so little time."

My hands clenched into fists.
My emotions burned within.
Forever...
...
...
...
I took action.
I would use the journal to make optimal decisions
throughout the day.
For happiness.
To build unity.
Friendship, company, bonds.
For something shameless.
...But in the end I just wasted the day.
Stuck in a rut of hypocrisy.
...
...
...
Then it was Friday.
By Friday, my relationship with everyone should have
come along, or at least changed.
But I just wanted to remain on good terms with
everyone, so I did nothing.
With Mimi, with Touko, with Kiri, and with Miki...
My relationship with each of them felt desperately
distant.
...
I spent half the day going around in circles.

[Taichi]
*sigh*

I was beat.
I squatted in front of the main gate, wondering what
to do for the evening.
I felt a familiar presence approach from afar.
It was Youko.
It was rare that she was so offhand.

[Youko]
"Is there anything I can help you with...?"

She said, standing in front of me.

[Taichi]
"No, not at the moment..."

Actually, I decided to ask her.
Desperate times called for desperate measures.

[Taichi]
"Hey...what can I do? I want things to go well for
everyone, but I don't know how to do it."
"Isn't there a way that would let everyone be
themselves, joke around, laugh... A way to help Mimi
with club activities with everyone joining in?"
"A way that everyone can resolve disputes, respect
each other, have hope..."
"Have cordial fights, check the broadcast script,
with everyone working together to deal with their
problems..."
"Is there not a path like that?"

Maybe she could tell me...
It was a faint grasp of hope.

[Youko]
"I don't think so."

[Taichi]
"..."

Her monotone voice sounded colder than usual.

[Youko]
"I don't even think that's even a possibility."
"I think for you, Taichi, to have everyone go
through club activities safely...you would either
need more time, or need a better starting point."
"Neither of which you have."
"There's a limit to what you can achieve."
"I think it's pointless no matter how hard you try."

[Taichi]
"I see..."

She said it so clearly.

[Taichi]
"That's a really blunt way of putting it..."

She didn't respond.
She stood still, waiting for what I would say.

[Taichi]
"Every time I start, things are just all over the
place."
"I just go through this over and over again. Each
week looping over, without accomplishing
anything..."
"What kind of a sick joke is this."

I held my head.
There was nothing to fill my void.

[Youko]
"Taichi... The journal isn't all that's out there."

She spoke abruptly.

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Youko]
"There are notes that contain the possibility of
destructive outcomes too."

[Taichi]
"There are? Where are they?"

[Youko]
"I hid them."
"So you wouldn't be hurt."
"Or...so you wouldn't give up."
"Do you want to see them...?"

[Taichi]
"..."

Destructive outcomes...

[Youko]
"No matter how you struggle or how you fight."
"Of all the possibilities out there, there is no one
who understands you..."
"Except me."
"I think that it's time that you understand that."

[Taichi]
"I do understand."
"But I also understand that what you feel for me
isn't love!"

I screamed.

[Taichi]
"What is this world!"

I let out an aggressive breath.
Sighing in irritation.

[Taichi]
"So... Are we in another reality?"

Youko stood in front of me.
And with her tiptoes, she wrote an X on the
ground.

[Youko]
"There are two possibilities."
"One is that two linear worlds have crossed paths
and we have mutual perception of the two
realities..."

Two worlds.
Twisted and intersected.

[Taichi]
"So the two realities collided and became
disordered?"
"Hm... In that case, what happened
to our original world? Is it still the way it was..."

[Youko]
"That's one possibility... The other is that this
reality is the product of the world we were in
before."

She denied me an easy answer.

[Taichi]
"..."
"In quantum mechanics, there is no interaction
between parallel worlds."

Paul Dirac was the grandfather of quantum mechanics,
but I had never read his original work.
I didn't even know if this world followed the rules
of quantum mechanics.

[Taichi]
"So that stuff you said earlier..."

[Youko]
"If you had to choose between A and B,
which would you choose?"

[Taichi]
"I guess it would be fifty-fifty."

[Youko]
"Right. And everyday, we have a countless number of
choices we can take in our lives."
"Like when you go to take a step, which foot do
you put forward?"
"When you go to eat, which grains of rice do you eat
first?"
"There are choices even on a microscopic level."
"We make the tiniest of choices every single
moment."
"The world is made up of these choices we make."
"And they are all equally real."

[Taichi]
"Equally real..."

[Youko]
"So let's say you choose A. You will come to know
reality by that choice of A."
"But at the same time, there is a Taichi in a
different world axis that chose B."
"I'm not trying to say that a parallel universe
exists but..."
"In Dirac's interpretation, you will not have any
perception of the B world when you chose A, and vice
versa."
"But if you think about it in a different way, it
may be possible to perceive multiple worlds."
"It's just like the people who can see ultra-violet
rays who have a different perception of the world."
"In theory, one who has perceived multiple realities
may in fact be able to exist in either world."
"In other words, simply observing another reality
will make you part of that reality."

[Taichi]
"Observing...?"
"So the other world has always been there and it's
just a matter of perception?"

[Youko]
"Something like that."
"But this theory still does not fit with what we are
experiencing."
"It doesn't give us an explanation to why we all
have simultaneously switched worlds at the same
time."
"We can only speculate about it..."

[Taichi]
"Hm..."
"What's the second possibility?"

[Youko]
"I think that this is could be our original world."
"So, we aren't even witnessing another reality?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, so the first explanation is off the table."

Her noble face nodded.

[Youko]
"World, time, history. They are all in series."
"Which means...time has not reverted."

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"
"But the journals go from Monday to Saturday... Then
they go back to Monday from there."

[Youko]
"It just gives the illusion of a time loop."
"However, the world is not actually going back in
time over and over indefinitely."
"This conclusion is the world's definite conclusion."
"Multiple worlds didn't cross over. Everything is
happening as it is supposed to. Reality is following
its single natural path."
"It appears to us that we are perceiving
multi-worlds crossed over but in reality, it is just
a single path that we are taking."

[Taichi]
"You said that we are following a single path, but
time has already been reset multiple times before."
"Besides, we never had any time loops occur in our
original world..."

Then I realized what was going on.
I understood it.

[Taichi]
"We were just unaware..."

Normally, we would have no way of knowing if we were
in a time loop.
Unless a special location, like the shrine, existed.
Perhaps time loops were a normal, but undetectable
part of reality.

[Taichi]
"So it's possible that time loops have always been a
part of reality. Since the dawn of mankind?"

It really did change things.
The earth collapsing over and over, and yet it
avoided destruction.
But still having disordered time and being unable
to advance was a form of Armageddon.

[Taichi]
"But... But..."

[Youko]
"For one reason or other, one the world reaches a
specific time on Sunday, then the world itself
disassembles."
"Then it reassembles itself back into the state that
everything had been the previous Monday morning."

[Taichi]
"But for the world, it's just another continuation."

[Youko]
"The existence of the journals prove that."
"The journals detail things that happened in the
past, or in other loops."
"If one can observe the past then the past exists."
"Just our current perception of reality pardons that
past."
"And we have been disassembled and reassembled
several times."
"Strictly speaking, I feel like we aren't even people
at this point."

[Taichi]
"Then what are we?"

[Youko]
"A mere phenomenon."

The word was so appropriate, it pierced my heart.
Not even people...

[Taichi]
"You said you think that we are on a single path,
but to me it sounds more like the multiple world
theory."

[Youko]
"Even if it seems like time is looping to us,
there's no way for us to actually confirm it."
"We just have to apply the theory that seems to best
fit out observations."
"In our present condition the world does not seem to
progress, so we just have to assume there is no
progression."

[Taichi]
"Ah, I see..."

I thought about it.
The many-worlds interpretation seemed more fitting
to me.

[Taichi]
"What if we are just stuck in world B, our original
world A is just left as it was?"

[Youko]
"There certainly is that possibility, but..."

[Taichi]
"But?"

[Youko]
"It could be that this phenomenon has occurred
because of the crossing of worlds."
"That would mean that things within world A would
also be affected."

[Taichi]
"Like, the people disappearing?"

[Youko]
"Maybe."
"But there could be even more severe effects."
"Like a far away world being completely destroyed or
something."
"The damage could be far more substantial than here,
but humans would never know about it."

Whatever way, the situation doesn't really seem
hopeful.

[Taichi]
"Multi-worlds, huh."

The quantum mechanics of the multi-world
interpretation don't actually support the existence
of a parallel universes.
That is actually a misunderstanding. A thought
experiment.
Rather, world A and world B both exist but cannot
interact with each other in any way.
Because they both exist at the same time.
That part was a little hard to understand.

[Taichi]
"If only Dirac's work had been translated, I would
have read it."

[Youko]
"Let's just say that it deviates from the current
theory a little."
"It all comes down to something that shouldn't have
happened actually occurred. That's it."
"There is much we can't understand."
"We can have our theories, but in the end they are
not going to help us."
"So what do we need?"

[Taichi]
"I don't know."

[Youko]
"You need someone who understands, right?"

She smiled.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"The person who understands you is right here."
"No one else will understands you like I do."
"Especially the more you try to hide your true
self."

Yes.
Of course.
The more you try to act like other people, the more
people perceive you to be that person.
But then once someone sees you for who you really
are, the front you put up will be shattered.
I remembered.

[Taichi]
"I know about that...well."
"Since that day!"

[Yusa]
"Nice room."

Yusa Doujima.
She was a good girl.
Pure and brave.
Even if she hid her illness in her heart,
she didn't know how to hurt others.

[Yusa]
"Um... I can't say what, but it feels like something
is different in here..."

She was just too sweet for my eyes to handle.

[Yusa]
"Taichi...?"

I plunged into darkness.
I suddenly showed her my true self. To her it was
like a deadly poison.

[Yusa]
"You...are Taichi... Right?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I am."

[Yusa]
"Ah, um... I..."

[Taichi]
"So pretty..."

My eyes must have been burning bright.
Flaming with desire.

[Taichi]
"So pretty... I want to see you with your clothes
off."

[Yusa]
"..."

If you've ever been stared down by a predator, then
you would know how she must have felt.
Eyes filled with desire.
Eyes filled with neither good nor evil will.
Just hunger.
Eyes that didn't see you as a human, they only saw
you as food to consume.
That was the ardent appetite that fell onto me.
An appetite so foul, it was sickening.
She saw it for what it was.

[Yusa]
"N-noo!!"
"I feel...sick..."
"Uh... Ugghh..."

I watched her cowered on the floor, about to vomit.
What a disgusting outcome.
She was broken.

[Taichi]
"..."

After that she avoided me.
She looked at me like I was a piece of filth.
In reality, I was filth.
I...
...

[Youko]
"It only hurts to stay here."
"They are nothing but food for you."

[Taichi]
"Shut up! I told you I know about that!"

Youko kept silent.

[Taichi]
"But if I can... I don't want to be like that..."
"Something will work out..."

[Youko]
"You only need me."

She held her own chest.

[Youko]
"If it was just you and me, things would work out."

A dark feeling hung in my abdomen.
