Hmm.
I made my way to the first-year classroom.
Maybe the MiKiri duo would be there.
No one was around.
Their bags were on their desks.
They'd been here.
Guess they're elsewhere in the school.
Come to think of it, the school was at the halfway
point between Kiri and Miki's houses.
The school was the ideal place for them to meet.
For whatever they want to do.
I looked out the window.
I saw the pool.

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

They were having fun.
They looked happy.
I heard their faint voices.

[Miki]
"There!"

[Kiri]
"Oh no! Stop!"

[Miki]
"Ah-hah! You're not getting away from me!"

[Kiri]
"I can't since we're in the water... Wait, please,
my hair is going to get wet!"

[Miki]
"Which hair is getting wet?"

[Kiri]
"That's a bad joke."

[Miki]
"Well, I'm bad to the bone! Hiyaa!"

[Kiri]
"Nooo...my hair..."
"Revenge!"

[Miki]
"Yahoo!"

It was a sight filled with happiness.

[Kiri]
"Hey!"

[Miki]
"Hiyaaaaaa!"

[Kiri]
"Take this!"

[Miki]
"Whaaa... Just kidding, that doesn't work on me!"

[Kiri]
"Hey! You can't use a kickboard!"

[Miki]
"It's a shield!"

[Kiri]
"That's not fair!"

[Miki]
"It is! My hair is longer so I'm allowed to use it!"

What kind of a rule is that?
My lips bent into a bitter smile.

[Kiri]
"But you can't attack as well with only one hand!"

[Miki]
"Damn it!"

[Kiri]
"Time to hunt!"

[Miki]
"Hunting season?!"

They sloshed around and splashed each other.
It all seemed so innocent.
My heart fluttered.

[Taichi]
"...!"

My heart skipped a beat.
The innocence moved my heart.
I felt my heart warm and open up.
I don't just mean my physical heart.
But my emotional state as well.
It made me happy.

[Kiri]
"Waah!"

[Miki]
"Hahahahaha! You fell!"

[Kiri]
"I'm drenched..."

[Miki]
"You're stuuupid. You're slooow."

[Kiri]
"I heard that..."

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Kiri]
"I can swim, now that I'm wet."

[Miki]
"Hey! Hey! Hey! No close combat!"

[Kiri]
"You're not swimming fast enough!"

[Miki]
"Faster. Faster."

[Kiri]
"I'm gonna dunk you underwater."

[Miki]
"No! My hair turns into seaweed when it's wet!"

[Kiri]
"Then I hope you like seaweed!"

[Miki]
"Wait! Wait! Hold on!"

[Kiri]
"Here we go!"

[Miki]
"Eeeek!!"

The sound of water splashing.
Endless laughter.
It was a tender reminder of the good times.
A glimpse of the gentle side of the world.
I thought I'd write about this in the journal.
I didn't want to forget this feeling.
Watching those two play, made time fly.
