I made my way home.
It was silent for a time, until the cicadas once
again started their crying.

[Shinkawa]
"Hey hey!"

[Taichi]
"Hm? Oh, it's 'Tanizaki'!"

[Shinkawa]
"Hey 'Konosu'! How're ya doing?"

[Taichi]
"You know me, Taichi 'Konosu,' even if my license is
suspended I'm still in high spirits!"

[Shinkawa]
"Sounds like you're in the same boat as me,
Yutaka 'Tanizaki'!"

[Taichi]
"It's been a few days, hasn't it, 'Tanizaki'?"

[Shinkawa]
"It has, 'Konosu'."

[Taichi]
"When will you come to our school, 'Tanizaki'?"

[Shinkawa]
"I should start classes tomorrow, 'Konosu'."

An A4-sized envelope fluttered in his hand.
It looked like school documents.

[Taichi]
"Hey, you'd better be in my class, 'Tanizaki'."

[Shinkawa]
"Don't be ridiculous, 'Konosu,' it's not like I get
to choose."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Shinkawa]
"Hahahah!"

We had a good laugh at that.

[Taichi]
"But 'Tanizaki'..."

[Shinkawa]
"Okay, I give up! Call me Shinkawa, not 'Tanizaki.'
Sorry, Kurosu."

[Taichi]
"Aww, giving up so soon?"

[Shinkawa]
"If I didn't, we'd keep going forever!"

[Taichi]
"Heading home?"

[Shinkawa]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"What's up, wanna stop by?"

[Shinkawa]
"Do you live nearby?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, about ten minutes from here."

[Shinkawa]
"Sounds like a nice area to live, I wish I could
visit. Next time, okay?"
"My niece, Kiri, is gonna attend Gunjo as well,
so I gotta go teach her all about it."

My ears...
...upon hearing that beautiful news...
...started burning. (So hot!)

[Shinkawa]
"What's that thumbs-up all about?"

[Taichi]
"Hey, who's that guy over there?"

[Shinkawa]
"Wh-who're you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"My bad, I guess it's no one. You were saying
something about your niece?"

[Shinkawa]
"Yes I was, what are you deaf?"

[Taichi]
"How old is she?"

[Shinkawa]
"A year younger than me."

[Taichi]
"Do you have a picture of her?"

[Shinkawa]
"Kurosu?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, nothing, my bad. Forget I said anything."
"So she's a year younger? She must be cute."

[Shinkawa]
"Well, yeah, she's good-looking but that's it."

[Taichi]
"What else is there?"

My voice naturally lowered as I said this.
It carried with it a note of envy, jealousy...
and hatred.

[Shinkawa]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry, just a frog in my throat."

[Shinkawa]
"I mean, she's kinda tomboy-ish."
"I'm just telling you how others see her, not me.
It's weird for me to even think of her like that."

[Taichi]
"Bullshit!"

[Shinkawa]
"Wh-what do you mean?!"

[Taichi]
"You're full of it, and I know it! She's your cute
younger relative, right? You must be aware of that,
right?!"
"I suppose you've never read a porno either?! You're
that much of a simpleton?! No one's that dumb,
that's how I know you're lying!"

[Shinkawa]
"Kurosu... I'm sorry, but it's the truth."

[Taichi]
"I don't wanna hear it!"

[Shinkawa]
"It's true, to me she's like a little sister who I
live with."

They live together?!
And share a bed?!
...and body warmth?!

[Taichi]
"Don't you realize how lucky you are?!"

[Shinkawa]
"That's a convenient way to miss the point."
"Her family took me in as one of theirs."
"Ever since, my niece and I have been like siblings."
"This time, I moved here with her family. And with
my leg...well...you know?"

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

I see.
I understood what he meant at that moment.
And so, that is why they are going to Gunjo
together.

[Taichi]
"Hey, so were ya hoping to get closer to your niece
when you transferred to Gunjo?"

[Shinkawa]
"Kinda, yeah. But I don't think I can offer her much
with my handicap."
"And besides, she's practically my little sister..."

[Taichi]
"You're a kind older brother, aren't ya?"

[Shinkawa]
"Um, we've been talking about my niece a bit too
much, don't you think?"

[Taichi]
"That's what being envious does."

[Shinkawa]
"Oh really? You know, living together for so long,
you see a lot more of those physiological things,
right?"

[Taichi]
"Physiological things?"

[Shinkawa]
"Sure, she's nice to look at, but after awhile
you see the parts that aren't so pretty..."
"The way she eats, the way she goes-"

[Taichi]
"Stop stop, let my dreams stay dreams!"

[Shinkawa]
"Your dreams, huh?"

[Taichi]
"I'd be more than happy to trade places with you
and get comfy with your niece."

[Shinkawa]
"Guh, TMI, I don't need to imagine that!"

[Taichi]
"Reality is a cruel mistress..."

I guess he really wasn't into it.
Thank goodness for the two-dimensional.

[Taichi]
"All right then, come by next time and we'll
hang out!"

[Shinkawa]
"Sure, I'll introduce you to my niece, too!"

[Taichi]
"Really?!"

I began trembling with excitement.

[Shinkawa]
"It's not that big of a deal... Don't expect too
much from it, all right?"

It wasn't that big of a deal.
He was blind to the possibilities that introducing me
would create, but he'd realize that before long.
