[Miki]
"Oh, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hey."

I encountered Miki, leaning against the wall.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Miki]
"Well... You know..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"Where are you going?"

[Taichi]
"To the roof."

[Miki]
"So, maybe for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Not 'maybe.' That's what I'm doing."

[Miki]
*sigh*

She seemed a bit dumbfounded.

[Miki]
"Really...for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Not for any other reason."
"Just to show my face, I guess."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Want to go together?"

[Miki]
"Well, now I'm busy..."

Then-
A girl emerged from the nearby restroom.
It was Kiri Sakura.
The other half of the Flowers.
She was a standoffish girl with a short haircut.

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri glanced at me...
Then ignored me.

[Kiri]
"Sorry to make you wait, Miki."

[Taichi]
"Gooooood mooooorning!!"

I stretched my mouth wide and greeted her loudly.

[Kiri]
"...Bye."

She returned my greeting with a scowl.
Of course.
Why did Kiri hate me?
It bothered me a lot that she hated me.

[Taichi]
"Today's really hot! I mean..."

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki."

[Miki]
"Kiri, don't be mean..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, let's go."

I walked along with the two of them. So far, so
good...

[Kiri]
"Kurosu."

[Taichi]
"What?"

I stopped.

[Kiri]
"I'd like to be with Miki, alone."

[Taichi]
"But the Flowers are a trio, altogether."

[Kiri]
"Tch."

She clicked her tongue.
Whoa...
That sent shivers down my spine.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, let's go on a date sometime. There's some
interesting movies out right now."

[Kiri]
"Are you crazy, Kurosu?"
"Stop messing with me. I'll just ignore you."

[Taichi]
"Hey, hey..."

I wasn't really trying to get her to hate me.
I guess I had to leave her alone for today.
Sweet things are good because you can take them
one lick at a time.
They're not as good if you eat them all at once.
Wait... Eat...?

[Taichi]
"Down, red snake!"

I punched myself upside the head.
Kiri eyed me suspiciously.
And in that instant...

[Kiri]
"Let's go... Wait, what's wrong?"

[Miki]
"My stomach..."

[Both]
Kiri: "Does it hurt?"
Taichi: "Does it hurt?"

[Miki]
"Ah... I just felt sick."

[Kiri]
"Tch."

Kiri glared at me.
What the hell.

[Miki]
"Don't fight after...I'm gone..."

[Taichi]
"Miki! Miki! No! Don't die! If you die, who will
give birth to my children!"

[Miki]
"Kiri will churn out kids for you..."

Super good news.

[Taichi]
"Really?"

I drew closer to Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Miki, stop messing with me."

[Miki]
"Whoa, are you mad for real?"

[Kiri]
"You can kiss the food I was going to give you from
my lunch goodbye!"

[Miki]
"You don't really mean that, do you?!"

She held on to Miki.

[Taichi]
"So, you were just faking?"

[Miki]
"Let's just say my stomach ache was, uhh...
psychological."
"But jeez, you two, get along already."

She sounded like she really meant it.

[Taichi]
"What, me? It's not my fault!"

[Miki]
"Try and imagine what it's like being sandwiched
between you two all the time."

[Taichi]
"Having a girl on each arm sounds okay to me?"

[Kiri]
"..."

I couldn't get enough of Kiri's glaring eyes.

[Taichi]
"Kind of the opposite of being sandwiched between
two guys...."

A meat sandwich. I liked where this was going...

[Taichi]
"Ham and cheese sandwiches..."

I made a soft, feminine expression.

[Miki]
"Dang, this guy's so weird, he's like an alien."

[Kiri]
"Miiikiii."

[Miki]
"Yeah, okay, Taichi, see you."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I guess I've got places I need to be, too."

[Miki]
"Then, if you'll excuse us."

I started to turn away.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, I'll leave Miki to you now, but I'll be back
for her later..."

[Miki]
"Wohooo! A love triangle!"

[Kiri]
"..."

She just ignored that.
She walked away solemnly.
Miki stayed behind, to whisper something to me.

[Miki]
"Kiri's not a bad girl...just... Sorry..."

[Taichi]
"All good."

[Miki]
"I'll give you my affection to make up for her lack
of it."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Miki]
"Maybe one day you two will reconcile. Then you can
sexually harass her all you want."

[Kiri]
"Miki, hurry!"

Miki jumped a bit.

[Miki]
"Whoa, well, see you."

[Taichi]
"Bye bye."

She ran up to Kiri, and they walked away.
I thought of following them.
They were charming.
I called out to both of them.

[Taichi]
"Hey, you two!"

They stopped, and only Miki turned.

[Taichi]
"Look after yourselves okay?"

Miki waved happily, while Kiri just glared.
On the roof, I could see that the assembly of the
antenna was not progressing well.

[Taichi]
"Misato?"

[Misato]
"Hm? Yes?"

[Taichi]
"What are you doing asleep this time of day?"

[Misato]
"What? I wasn't sleeping."

She squirmed around, still looking half asleep.

[Misato]
"Anyway, good morning."

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Misato."
"Won't you get sunstroke, sleeping here?"

[Misato]
"Oh, yeah, but I'm being careful."

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

It didn't feel right to look at her like this. I
turned around.
Amazing. I was such a gentleman.
Sometimes, I amaze myself.

[Misato]
"Better clean these glasses."

Misato was still half asleep behind me.
Maybe she had been up all night again?
I wasn't brave enough to ask her.
I looked back and she peered at me.
I could see those ample thighs of hers.
But, they didn't turn me on.
I was back to my normal self.
Well, was this even normal for me?
Whatever.

[Taichi]
"Hm!"

I suddenly had a strange thought.
About this girl, Misato.
Misato wore glasses.
Her glasses were one of her defining features. They
added charm and made her stand out.
But often these glasses-type characters flew under
people's radars. It's absurd!
I, Taichi Kurosu, have one thing to say to those
people!
Don't underestimate the allure of a bespectacled
girl!
Ahh... I felt better.
Then, Misato spoke.

[Misato]
"Sweepy..."

She tried to stop a yawn as she wiped her glasses.
She was so pure.
My pure Misato.
I turned around to face her direction again.
She put her glasses back on.

[Misato]
"I'm so sleepy."

[Taichi]
"Sure looks like it."

[Misato]
"So, umm... What were we talking about?"

[Taichi]
"I want to help out."
"I'm part of the club, so let me help with the
work."

[Misato]
"Ahh..."

She started mumbling to herself.
I tried to listen to what she was saying, but I
couldn't quite make it out.
I could just hear bits and pieces of her mumbling.

[Misato]
"I was stupid to worry."
"I wasn't trying to run."
"...Like a dog..."
"I'm used to it."
"It's not a bother..."
"...Need to be taught."
"I'm older, after all."
*hiccup*

She finished with a hiccup.
What in the world was going on?
She was normally a fine, clear-headed kind of girl.
Something was up.

[Taichi]
"M-Misato?"

[Misato]
"Script..."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Write the script."

Her eyes seemed to sink as she spoke.

[Taichi]
"Script? What are you talking about?"

[Misato]
"The script for the first transmission of the Gunjo
Gakuin Broadcasting Club."

[Taichi]
"Oh, the planned transmission to be sent through
that antenna on its first broadcast?"

[Misato]
"Yes, something that's thought provoking, profound,
and rings true."
"Something that will allow our broadcasting club to
revitalize that old fashioned youth culture through
the ears of those that hear us!"

A bunch of liquor bottles rolled around her feet.

[Taichi]
"Uhh...?"

[Misato]
"Lack of morals, too much individualism, violations
of human rights, all the things that are a hazard to
a kid in this day and age!"
"Can we youth collectively build ourselves up again?
The Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club can be the answer
that our generation seeks!"

[Taichi]
"Well said!"

[Misato]
"Heh heh heh."

She laughed.
She relaxed a little and put her hands into her
pockets.
Then she pulled something out.
It was a small bottle of sake.

[Taichi]
"Hey... Wait!"

Too late!
She chugged it down, with the practiced form of
a heavy drinker.
It was like watching some old guy at a bar.

[Misato]
"We need that script..."

She said, her eyes looking droopy.

[Taichi]
"S-sure..."

[Misato]
"The deadline is on Sunday."

[Taichi]
"Okay."

[Misato]
"Great!"
"Well, then... I'm gonna expect the best from you...
And...maybe, I think, I'll take a nap over here..."

[Taichi]
She sounded positively drunk.

[Misato]
"Ugh..."

She lay down on the ground.

[Taichi]
"You can't do that!"

[Misato]
"Heh heh heh heh..."

[Taichi]
"Misato! Misato!"

[Misato]
"Night..."

And she was asleep.
She's normally so serious. It must be the liquor...
I couldn't believe it.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I checked the liquor that she drank.
It was non-alcoholic.
Alcohol: 0\p.

[Taichi]
"She got drunk on this?"

That obviously shouldn't have had any effect...
Odd.

[Taichi]
"Anyway... Let's get you to the nurse's office
to sleep."

[Misato]
"Pekke...good..."

It sounded like she was trying to say thanks,
but didn't quite get the words out.

[Taichi]
"I'm going to pick you up and carry you, okay?"

[Misato]
*zzz*

[Taichi]
"I might touch your boobs or butt, okay?"
"You might not have panties on when you wake,
okay?"
"When you wake up, you might feel a breeze down 
there and say, 'Where are my panties? What
happened?'"
"Did I do something shameful? No... I couldn't
have... What's wrong with me."
"Nothing! For I, Taichi Kurosu, am the depraved
one!"

I slapped myself on the head.

[Taichi]
"Ugh, seriously..."

Sure, fine. Just go to sleep on me why don't you?
Anyway, I got her to sit up.
She slumped.
Her neck rolled.
She was dead asleep.

[Taichi]
"She must have been really tired."

I needed to get her up to take her to the nurse's
office.
I threw her over my back and tried to move her.
But with her asleep, it was difficult to maneuver.

[Taichi]
"Hm? Huh?"

I finally got her up into a piggyback position.
In order to stabilize her, I reached my arms around
to hold her.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

My fingers poked something that I didn't expect.
*poke*
My fingers got caught in her clothes.
She was starting to slip.
I tried to keep her on my back, but she was falling.
My hands slipped, and her blouse started
to pull out of her skirt.

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

This wasn't good! Her clothes might rip.
I let her down.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

Okay.
*flop*
Something had fallen on the floor.

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

Her bra!
Why?
When I touched her, I must have...

[Taichi]
"Damn, she'll 'punish' me if she finds out."

Part of me wouldn't mind that, though.
I picked up her bra.
And pushed her blouse back into her skirt.

[Taichi]
"..."

I had to do something with her bra...
Today, she hadn't worn a bra. She forgot.

[Taichi]
"Let's go with that."

I put her bra in my pocket, and picked her up again.
She was quite heavy.
I managed to get her onto my back once again.
Her boobs...
With only a shirt to cover them.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh..."

I could feel them against me.

[Taichi]
"Hurry...to the nurse's room."

I felt pretty embarrassed.
My face was hot.
I wasn't myself.
I got there, finally.
There was no one around.
I laid her down on the bed.

[Taichi]
"Good night, Misato. Sweet dreams."
"..."

As I watched her sleep, my heart began to well up.

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

I put my face close to hers.
*smooch*

[Taichi]
"Okay then."

The day had just begun.
...With a kiss.
Just like usual, Mutsumi wasn't around.
She had left a note for me.
-You will need to go out for dinner.

[Taichi]
"Well, better head out then."

And I cheerfully went out the door.
One of the good things about living in the country
was the cool nights.
There was a cool wind that felt good on the skin.
I had a lot to write about.
I had to write in my diary and start on the script
for the broadcasting club's transmission.
I started with the script.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

What would be good for the club's first broadcast?

[Taichi]
"..."

I just couldn't get started on it.
Write, erase, write, erase.
One step forward, one step back.
When I hunched over my desk an hour later...
Jeez, only a few lines!
"We are the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club. We have
taken control of this broadcast area. We advise all
personnel to abandon arms..."

[Taichi]
"No, no, no!"

I ripped it up and threw it away.
I wanted to make an impression, but I was going
completely off-track!
I should have been more serious.
I had tried to slip a joke in, but it just didn't work.

[Taichi]
"I give up."

I just couldn't get into it.
I decided to write in the diary instead.
"Express your emotions!"
"Who first thought of putting curry bread roux on
rice? Sheer genius."
"That question always gets me so bolstered."
   *Bolstered = Taichi's mistaken word for bothered.
    He mixed up how bad logic bothers, while
    good logic is bolstered by facts.
    He also spells 'turtleneck' as 'totalneck.'
    Because he figures they totally cover
    necks...
    Of course 'totalneck' would make more sense.
"It's like I've been croxxing back and forth on some
path I'd never considered crossing, and my days seem
to conclude in emptiness."
   *Croxxing = Taichi's stylistic mispelling.
"Baudelaire once said..."
"God is dead."
"Doubt, or the absence of faith and naivete, is a
virture peculiar to this age, for no one is obedient
nowadays."
@@*Virture = Another Taichi misquote.
"For example, in class, when starting up a fruity
conversation with an obstinate girl."
@@*Fruity = Taichi's mixup for "fruitless."
"Or in the hall, when we meet two friends, one close
and one estranged, at the same time."
"And the two of them have established a friendly
relationship."
"I, to each of them (flow of obscene sentences)."
"What we cannot speak about we must pass over in
silence."
"Those were the famous words of Kierkegaard."
"The neutral beauty of Kiri, and my proper passion
for her, I will now cease talking about."
"That wasn't the only pleasure in my life."
"That's right."
"For the one who I met on the roof, my life's guide,
the lovely, compassionate, and motherly Misato, I
have not enough room in my paiges."
@@*Paiges = Taichi's mispelling of 'pages.'
"First, her thighs are, to say the least-
(The following sentences are censored.)"
"And in my hands, was the bra that held up her
breasts."
"The scent I breathed in from it sent my mind into a
ravishing fantasy."
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@-FIN-
I knew it.
I was filled with poetry and philosophy.
If I had been born in the midst of Bohemian London,
I would have been established as an artistic genius
by now.
I was a master of words.
Imagery, irony, hyperbole and alliteration. I could
do it all.

[Taichi]
"Hm."

I stretched out and relaxed.
Being an author's not so bad.
Other than having to rein in my craft because
contemporary Japan just isn't ready.
Maybe I should keep writing while I'm on a roll.
By the time I was done with it, it would be a
luxurious, intricately crafted masterwork of a
manuscript.
I got in the mood again, and picked up the pen.
