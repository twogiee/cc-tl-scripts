I woke up.
The sunshine pierced through the window.
It seemed like I had a slept soundly. I couldn't
recall a single dream.
The time was...seven o'clock.
There was no need to go to school.
But my body instinctively moved.
There was no breakfast waiting for me.
What else could I have expected?
Mutsumi who was beautiful and hard working, was 
no longer here. Neither was her cooking.
She took me in.
And the way she gently took care of Youko...
I had nothing but appreciation for her.
But before I could repay her kindness, she had gone.
There were two paper bags on the desk.
Inside were...sandwiches.
It must be Youko.
A bag for one person, and another for two people.
For breakfast and for lunch.
The bag for two people was for lunch.
That's what was cute about her.
She wasn't used to persisting on other people.
She was the type who fed herself.
We'd known each other for ten years and it was still
awkward.
She could be closer to perfection if she persisted
more.

"Thank you."

Even then.
I thanked the house next door.
