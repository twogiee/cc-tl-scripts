I hesitated for a moment when I got to the door.
What nerve did I have dropping by the club?
Humans are driven by feelings. So, maybe that's what
spurred me on.
At least, that's what I felt.
But still, I wondered how she felt...
It bothered me, a little.
I turned the knob and pushed on the door.
The wind blew.
But the second I stepped out...
Something made me feel so cheerful, somehow.
Further down, I saw a large antenna, which was built
on the same foundation as the water tank.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

The antenna was unfinished.
The parts and knowledge needed were lacking.
But this girl kept at it, as she tried to finish it
little by little.
She did it alone.
Just a single girl...
She was standing by the antenna, embraced by the
wind.
She was so cool, it made me jealous.
Misato Miyasumi.
Misato.

[Taichi]
"Misato!"

As I called out to her, her black hair flared out in
a sudden gust, as if it were made out of a fine
film.
She turned to me.
The wind whipped her long, lustrous hair.
Misato struggled to get through her flying hair, but
I finally glimpsed her face.

[Misato]
"..."

In the bright early morning light, her face wore a
look of emptiness.
Her expression was like spring ice at the turn of
summer.
It melted instantly, as I knew it would.

[Misato]
"...?"

Her plump, pale lips parted to form words.
The wind raged in my ears and drowned out what she
had just said.
But I knew by watching her lips what it was.
I grinned, and answered.

[Taichi]
"I've come!"

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"Hello!"

I raised both hands to the sky and cried out.
She looked dumbfounded.
Her expression became one of tenderness so quickly
it was like a movie skipping a frame.

[Misato]
"Hello!"

She answered.
She was the same as ever.

[Misato]
"What's the matter, Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"I can see your panties!"

I said.
It wasn't like she could really hear me.
I really could see them, and if I were any closer
I'd probably lose it.
I had been well aware of the probability of a
panty-sighting in this wind, so I'd prepared myself
mentally.
I was able to retain my serenity despite the sight
of her sleek, plump and sinful thighs and her
irresistible inverted triangle of passion.
Taichi Keyword:
"Irresistible inverted triangle of passion"
Refers to girls' underpants.
Taichi has broad tastes, but prefers younger girls.
Pure, simple, not too gaudy or colorful...in theory.
In reality all bets were off.
If it weren't so, a maggot of a man like myself
could never hold back the passions aroused by the
fleshly enticement of this older girl's gluteus.

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Please sell me your panties!"

[Misato]
"Please make you mac and cheese?"

[Taichi]
"?!"

She almost got it! 80 percentos!

[Taichi]
"Let's eat l-lunch t-t-together!"

[Misato]
"Oh! Yes, let's do that!"

She waved her fist in the air.

[Misato]
"But I can't make mac and cheese!"

[Taichi]
"Th-that's too bad!"

[Misato]
"Sorry!"

Somehow, I threw her off the scent.
That was close...
I kept my perversions a closely guarded secret from
her.
It would destroy me if she ended up hating my guts.
She's the one who invited me to join the broadcast
club when I was so alone.

[Misato]
"Is that what you came up here for?"

[Taichi]
"I was nearby, so I decided on a whim to come help
out!"

[Misato]
"On a wh-whim?"

Her face froze.

[Taichi]
"It's just an expression."

[Misato]
"Ummm... Wait there a second."
"Okay, sorry about that!"

She stood there smiling, hands clasped in front of
her.
With her hands like that, it was like she was hiding
Ms. Omata.
Taichi Keyword:
"Ms. Omata"
Refers to the crotch.
For some reason, it's been anthropomorphized.
I opened up a famous photo editing software suite
(pirated).
It booted up in 0.1 seconds. Because it's in my
brain, after all.
First, I cut her face from the background by drawing
a path with the pen tool.
I searched for a nude picture of a model with a
similar figure.
Surprisingly, there actually was a picture of a
similar model!
She's past her sell-by date these days, but there
was a stick-thin nude model who was famous for
dating sumo wrestlers back in the day. Amen for her!
So I merged Misato's face layer with the model's
picture.
With fine tuning, I blurred the seams and erased any
excess bits.
I figured her breasts were different, so I searched
for more beautiful, rounded ones and added them in.
I also used the original's arms and legs, since she
was baring them anyway.
I adjusted the exposure and drew in some shadowing,
checking the overall composition as I did so.
Where the skin color differed, I added a pale yellow
layer, and used the soft light blend mode to match
the skin tones.
It looked sad without a background, so I pasted a
majestic temple behind her.
All done!
A new addition to my spank bank, good for ten years!
I immediately saved it in my mental HDD under
T:\Math Problems\S Class.
They're divided into r`abc ranks.
S was the best. D was the worst.
That's how I stored them on my real PC, too.
And the first statement in my will was:
"Immediately throw my HDD away.
(Absolutely no viewing/distributing the contents.
If you do, I will curse you with my entire being)."
I figured no one would look in my Math Problems
folder, anyway.
That's why my Math Problems folder is the embodiment
of my wild oats.
That's right.
My Math Problems folder was my forbidden, holy
sanctuary.

[Misato]
"What was that about your Math Problems folder?"

[Taichi]
"Aaack!"

I talked widdout shiiinking! (Not sure what accent
that was supposed to be).

[Taichi]
"My lady, need you any help from such as I?"

I reverently took her fingers.
She stared unblinkingly.

[Misato]
"But, it's time for school to start."

The way she tilted her head to one side should be
illegal.

[Taichi]
"Oh, school..."

I furiously shook my head and frowned.

[Taichi]
"Nothing could possibly take higher priority than
being of aid to you right here and now!"

[Misato]
"What?"

She looked so lovely when she's confused.

[Taichi]
"I would be most honored to be allowed to help in
the perpetuation of your descendants!"

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, uh..."

I struggled to shut my trap.
I really had to drop my habit of saying everything
that came into my head.

[Taichi]
"The antenna's really coming along, isn't it!"

[Misato]
"Yes. I've worked so hard on it!"

[Taichi]
"Is it finished?"

[Misato]
"Not even close, really."

The vendor was supposed to have put it up.
But they ran off after delivery.

[Misato]
"I'm no expert... I'm just trying to figure it out
the best I can."
"The structure is one thing, I haven't even started
on the wiring and adjustments."

[Taichi]
"Oh, dear..."

Unfortunately, I had no idea how to do any of that.

[Taichi]
"It doesn't look like there's much I can help with,
then..."

[Misato]
"I do appreciate the thought, though."

I caught a glimpse of Misato's hands, all covered in
scratches.
Ah...
She's been really struggling...
Those spindly arms could barely lift a CRT monitor!

[Taichi]
"Um, Misato..."

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Why are you trying to do all this yourself?"
"The others are around. Why not bring them in on
it?"

[Misato]
"Hmm..."
"Well, I am the club president."
"If I don't do my part, why would anyone else?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it's not like they are doing their part, even
though you are."

[Misato]
"Well, you came, didn't you Pekke?"

Oh, right through the heart.

[Misato]
"And I want to do it myself, too."
"I'm just doing what I like."
"Just like everyone else."

[Taichi]
"But...everyone else isn't just doing that, are
they?"

[Misato]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"At least, that's the way it seems to me..."

I guess.

[Taichi]
"Maybe I'm just not really seeing reality."
"Things being the way they are..."

[Misato]
"I'm the same way..."

Her expression became confused for a moment.
Then her smile returned in full bloom.

[Taichi]
"Mimimi, you're so strong."
*Mimimi is short for Minimal Mighty Misato.

[Misato]
"..."

Oh, it's been a while...
Her true face.
A colorless, coldly distant expression.
This was her "I'm not impressed" face.

[Misato]
"Who's that supposed to be?"

[Taichi]
"I apologize, my mistake, Mimi."

She grinned.

[Misato]
"So you've already gotten over it, Pekke."

God, she was so freaking cute.
But why did she hate it when you added one extra
little syllable?
And why was she totally okay with Mimi?

[Misato]
"And so you came here?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, well..."

To be honest, I just wanted to flirt with her.

[Misato]
"You're sweet."

She petted my head.
Her gentle fingertips ruffled my hair.
Ah, the loving caress of those delicate fingers...
My "lower back" began to itch at the sensation.
A wet-behind-the-ears kid wouldn't understand.
When someone played with my cowlick, it was like I'd
either get a case of the runs or a backache.
Oh, yes... It appeared I'd not completely purged the
T drive of dirty thoughts.
My auto-save probably kicks in whenever I get too
stimulated.

[Misato]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"The tentpole is up..."

[Misato]
"Oh? Where at?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi, please teach me the mathematical formulae you
learned last term."

[Misato]
"Okay."
"~~..."

But instead of withering me, it only swelled me up.

[Taichi]
"Oh, pardon my rudeness, mamedoiselle..."

[Misato]
"Suddenly you're so gentlemanly!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed, being a gentleman is my life's work."

[Misato]
"But it's not 'mamedoiselle,' it's 'mademoiselle.'"

[Taichi]
"..."
"Right, what can I help you with?"

[Misato]
"Oh, but it's already past time for the bell to
ding-a-ring-ring!"

She rang an invisible bell.
I think she meant 'ring-a-ding-ding.'
On second thought, rubbing that mistake in her face
might not be a good idea!
On second thought, physical contact now might
not be a good idea!
On second thought, forcing her to
atone for that might not be a good idea!
I mean, I really liked her.
The allure of glasses is truly a thing of terror.

[Taichi]
"Is it time, though?"

The bell hadn't rung, actually, so I hadn't noticed.

[Taichi]
"Why don't we skip?"

[Misato]
"Oh dear, it looks like we've found a bad boy!"
"I guess it's true."

She looked to the sky and let out a sigh.

[Misato]
"You are a bad boy."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"No, nothing, never mind."
"But anyway, it's so hot during the day. This is no
place to be out working."
"So even if we did skip classes, there'd be nothing
to do."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, you're right."

It'd suck if we got heatstroke.

[Misato]
"I'll try again after sundown."

[Taichi]
"Can I help?"

[Misato]
"You're definitely stronger, Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"You've got yourself all figured out, and know what
you want to do."

The conversation took a sudden turn.

[Taichi]
"Well, so do you, right?"

Sadness stole over her rounded face.
She looked ready to cry, and my chest felt tight.
Of course.
She's the only one who could make me feel this way.
Just a common, unexceptional feeling, but one I was
proud of.
But setting all of the sex stuff aside, I really
liked this girl.
I wanted her to be happy.
I didn't want her to hate me.

[Misato]
"Is something the matter?"

[Taichi]
"Wha-wha-what?!"

Her face filled my vision, it was so close.

[Misato]
"Wha?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, you gave me a start!"

[Misato]
"Hmm...A start? Hmm..."

For some reason, she seemed impressed.

[Taichi]
"It's getting hot. Want to go inside?"

[Misato]
"Yes, let's."

The president of the broadcast club cast one last
glance back at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"..."

I really didn't know what she was thinking.
She wasn't really one to show what she was truly
feeling so easily.
Which is exactly why I loved seeing her shocked face
earlier.
It let me know that her usual gentle expression was
merely a mask.
