I dreamed about Sakuraba pushing me down.
"I don't care if you're a guy."
That's what the blond noble boy mumbled as he
attacked me.
But, wasn't that strange?
Back then, he wasn't blond.
But who cares...
Though given that Sakuraba was outfitted with the
mightiest of spears and an impenetrable shield,
rationalizing what I was seeing was pointless.
"I'll use contraception."
That was the excuse he made as he came closer.
He kept mumbling about using contraception while he
forced himself on me, while I wanted to push him
away.
Why did it end up this way?
Was it because of the terrible things I wrote in my
diary?
Was it punishment from the gods?
Retribution?
Hammurabi's Code?
Wait, no. One of these things is not like the
others.
I descended into panic, even though I knew it was a
dream.
"Don't come any closer!"
"Have mercy!"
"You beast!"
And as I cried out, I pushed Sakuraba away.
It turned into a pure wrestling match...
But it wasn't pure...
He was serious and haughty.
I thought he'd murder me.
I wailed on him with my fists.
I got one clean hit in.
Sakuraba rolled away.
I saw him on his back, unconscious.
Then the scene suddenly changed. A volcano erupted.
It was like something from a Showa Era play.
Oh, yes.
Talk about a twisted turn of events.
I covered my eyes.
And then I woke up.

[Taichi]
"That was too surreal."

A guy like him shouldn't have the guts to push
someone over.
He was a weak guy with a silver spoon in his mouth.
If I was going to have a weird dream I'd prefer
one where Misato was the one...err, reassuring
me.
Then a scene flashed in my mind. One that I should
not have imagined.
I changed clothes and went downstairs.
My breakfast was prepared.
It came with a note.
"Eat it all before you leave."
The beautiful and hard-working Mutsumi was an
excellent cook.
Though she was rarely at the house since she was so
busy.
My proverbial hat was off to her.
Because she insisted, I devoured the thick sandwich
and vegetable juice.
I had no time.
I wrapped up the rest and shoved it in my pocket.
I'll eat it later.
The sun shined with assertion.
That started the morning.
I got distracted.
I walked a little bit, then...

[Sakuraba]
"Gyaaaooo!"

It was Sakuraba's scream.
And it sounded so close.
The bark of a dog and the screams mixed together.
Then they got farther away.

[Taichi]
"It must be after him..."

Somehow it didn't surprise me.
And then...

[Girl]
"Huh? Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Girl]
"Oh, good morning."

She bowed her head a bit.
It was Yusa, a pretty girl who lived on my block.
Kamisaka really is a good town.
Yusa was too cute for words, and the way she held
bags of curry rolls in her hands was just too much.
We walked along together.
We'd been walking mornings together for a while now.
Which made sense, seeing as how we went to the same
school.
And from behind us, we heard a husky voice say
"Goodbye!"
It was Yusa's mother.
She was a bit on the heavy side.
But she found joy in everyday life, so I couldn't
fault her for her weight.
Yusa was a beautiful girl born into an ordinary
home.
She only had one problem; she was too naive.
As her classmate, and the guy closest to her, I
shouldered a lot of responsibility for looking out
for her.

[Yusa]
"Goodbye!"

She waved and smiled genuinely at her mother.
She just seemed to be reaching adolescence.
She was the third tallest girl in her class. She had
a purity that any guy would've been happy to take...
And she had just learned how to address her seniors,
which was something to see in of itself. Her purity
was more precious than diamonds...
I always struggled with whether to have dirty
thoughts about her or not. Part of me was painfully
aware that I was a dirty old man on the inside.
No, seriously.
So there I was, swinging between the two extremes.
Just like the bags of curry rolls swinging from her
hands.

[Taichi]
"Are those curry rolls?"

[Yusa]
"Yup."

The bags swayed back and forth as we walked.
She walked with her arms out in front of her, like a
ghost.

[Taichi]
"Is that your...breakfast?"

[Yusa]
"Well, Sakuraba was just there, so..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, he was."

[Yusa]
"Did you see him?"

[Taichi]
"Only traces of him."

[Yusa]
"Traces?"

[Taichi]
"Well, when I got here he was gone."

[Yusa]
"That's too bad."
"I was thinking of giving him a curry roll."

She was going to feed it to him.

[Taichi]
"Well, Combat hates Sakuraba."

[Yusa]
"Yoshida's dog, Combat?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, and he is something. That dog can yank his
chain himself."
"He's a free spirit. Goes out when he wants and
comes back when he feels like coming back."

[Yusa]
"Combat doesn't attack unarmed people."

[Taichi]
"Thoroughbred yakuza don't."

[Yusa]
"Was he a...yakuza, now?"

[Taichi]
"He's packing on the pounds these days, but he's
still got the blood of a soldier in his veins."
"If he was human he'd be a grizzled war vet."
"But he only attacks Sakuraba."

[Yusa]
"Weird, huh."

[Taichi]
"It is weird."

We walked at a slow pace.

[Yusa]
"What should I do with it?"
"Are you hungry?"

[Taichi]
"Do you want to share?"

[Yusa]
"Sure!"

We both ate the curry rolls.

[Taichi]
"How are you adjusting to school?"

[Yusa]
"Long way to go."

[Taichi]
"Any bullies?"

[Yusa]
"None at all! I'm glad!"

[Taichi]
"I bet you are."

The heaven of Gunjo Gakuin. Good old Gunjo...

[Taichi]
"If something happens, bluff and tell them you have
high school friends that'll beat them up. Call on me
anytime."

[Yusa]
"Got it."

She looked so happy.

[Yusa]
"I don't trip over my words like that anymore,
though..."

She blushed.

[Taichi]
"Heheh."

I guess she said that because I used to make fun of
her for it.

[Taichi]
"So, is Mr. Sakakibara in charge?"

[Yusa]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"A good teacher. You're lucky."

His hobby was making figurines of beautiful girls,
but that's over.

[Yusa]
"Hahaha, is that so?"
"Well, the class really works hard, so I'm happy."

[Taichi]
"That's great."

[Yusa]
"My mom's there for me, too."

[Taichi]
"Right."
"When push comes to shove, she protects you. It's an
ideal life."

[Yusa]
"That, and..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Yusa]
"My teacher told me to start an exchange diary."

[Taichi]
"They used to give us that assignment, way back."

That was a homeroom assignment, I think.

[Taichi]
"I got left out of my class, so I did it with a high
schooler."

[Yusa]
"Yeah, I got left out too."

[Taichi]
"Wha?"

[Yusa]
"Well, I was the odd one."

[Taichi]
"Wait, so you're exchanging with the teacher?"

[Yusa]
"No, um, so..."

She rummaged through her bag and took out a
notebook.

[Yusa]
"Can I ask you for something, Taichi?"

It was a colorful green notebook.
It had a faint mint smell.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, sure!"

I shouted with both fists raised.

[Yusa]
"..."

[Taichi]
"What's the matter, dear?"

[Yusa]
"Well, is it okay? Don't you need time to think
about it?"

[Taichi]
"Of course it's okay."

[Yusa]
"That was quick..."

[Taichi]
"Is that notebook the diary? Did you write the first
entry?"

[Yusa]
"Oh, yeah, this and that."

[Taichi]
"This and that?"

This and that of a sexually immature girl.
The arrangement of those words simply drove me
crazy for some reason.
But in front of Yusa, I had to have a little
composure.
What I called the "cold shower of logic".

[Taichi]
"That's something I'll look forward to."

I pushed my bangs from my eyes.
Her eyes gazed at my white hair.
Now that I noticed, my face and hair got a lot of
attention.
Which reminded me of a novel of a prince with the
same beautiful white hair.
I used to talk about it a lot.
And I used to wonder if I came across as prince
material.
Boy, that would be nice...
But...my looks weren't good enough.
Some wishes don't get granted.

[Yusa]
"It's kind of embarrassing."

[Taichi]
"I won't laugh at what you wrote."

[Yusa]
"..."

Wow, I guess I got a lot of points for saying that.
I made the mistake of saying too many lecherous
things to my precocious Miki.
I'd hit rock bottom.
And now I've transformed into this girl's
playfriend.
Shit!
Every time I remembered, it was hard to take!
Fingers crossed, this time the beautiful girl would
just throw her virginity at me (logic fail).
So much reasoning. Be a gentleman.

[Taichi]
"May I take that from you, Fraulein?"

[Yusa]
"What? Frownlines?"

[Taichi]
"Oops. Never mind."

I had used too many complicated expressions, so I
fell back on a classic of mine.

[Taichi]
"You're such a cute girl."

I gently wiped a tear from her eye.

[Yusa]
"What? Was there something near my eye?"

She hadn't cried.

[Taichi]
"You're my beloved lady."

[Yusa]
"What?"

I tried to manage the situation gracefully.
Yusa's expression changed as if she had washed it
off.
And deepened into a shameful blush that was the
color of a rose in full bloom...or not.

[Yusa]
"Achoo!"

She sneezed lightly.

[Yusa]
"Ah, sowwy... Ah."

That final "ah" wasn't the lewd gasp that escapes
when a sensitive part is touched. Just saying.
It was the sound of slight surprise at something
coming into her field of vision.
Yusa and I had a bridge between us.
One side was connected to my uniform,
just around my chest.
The other side was Yusa's nose.
In other words...

[Yusa]
"Uh... Huh?"

A bridge of snot.
A long strand of liquid...
Hung...
And created a bridge between us.
I had a working theory about what had happened:
When she sneezed, a volley of snot shot out faster
than a bullet train and hit my uniform.
The snot stuck strongly, and formed a bridge between
me and her nostril, and though something like it
would normally break, it didn't.

[Yusa]
"..."

It looked like Yusa understood the situation well.
Her face went pale.
No one moved.
Or rather, we couldn't move.
This overly simple girl with her strange snot, had
defiled the noble clothes of a young, gallant prince
(roll with me on this).
Or put another way:
"Snot-erella."
"Snot White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Several other ideas for strange and cruel titles
rattled off in my head.
Children always look for the funny side of things.
And the more fragile she seemed...
The funnier she became.

[Yusa]
"Ah... I...um... I..."

Her nerves must have been getting the better of her.
Her eyes were open, and they seemed to well up
instantly.
No!
I couldn't give her more trauma.
This was a job for the dashing white-haired prince
of Atlantis.
Before she got confused, I silently took out a
handkerchief.
First, I wrapped it around Yusa's nose.

[Yusa]
"Hrn?"

That was a strange sound to make.
After wiping the top, I then wiped under her nose
several times.
I wiped up the rest of the snot bridge, and then
wiped my own uniform.
Then I put the handkerchief back into my pocket, or
tried to.

[Yusa]
"No! You can't do that!"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Yusa]
"It's d-dirty! You can't! Throw it away."
"I'll pay you back for it!"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."

I smiled brightly.

[Taichi]
"Well, let's go."

[Yusa]
"I-I'm sorry, but the handkerchief..."

She started to wipe her tears away with the back of
her thumb.

[Taichi]
"This handkerchief won't bother my cute friend
anymore."

[Yusa]
"Hmm?!"

She was quite shocked.

[Taichi]
"I don't care about repayment, just make sure you
don't catch a cold, Yusa!"

I then lightly tapped her head and started to walk.
Yusa fell silent.

[Taichi]
"Hey, off to school, Miss."

[Yusa]
"Yeah..."
"Okay!"

She ran to catch up with me.

[Yusa]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

She gripped my hand.
Her face was red to her ears as she bowed.
She looked so cute just by doing that.
Part of me genuinely valued her affections.
The other part of me was bursting with dark desires.
That part could kindly fuck off and die.
Touko was there.
I mean, she was always the first to arrive.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Touko]
"Hmph!"

Was she ignoring me?
Was that it?

[Taichi]
"Underwear..."

[Touko]
"Not this again."

[Taichi]
"Could you buy me some underwear?"

[Touko]
"Why do I have to buy you underwear?!"

She stood up and left her desk.

[Taichi]
"The morning's just started and you're already
so hot."

I gave her a thumbs-up.

[Touko]
"..."

She grabbed my thumb and jerked it to the side as if
to break it.

[Taichi]
"Gyaaaooo!"
"Idiot! What if you break it?"

I think that's what I shouted.
I'm glad I pulled my hand back so fast.

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me."

[Taichi]
"Did you watch TV yesterday?"

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me!"

[Taichi]
"Hmph..."

And deepened into a shameful blush that was the
color of a rose in full bloom...or not.
And when you speak, again, and they harshly tell you
not to talk to them.
