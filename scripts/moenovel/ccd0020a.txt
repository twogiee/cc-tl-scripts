"Heeey!"

[Misato]
"Ahhh, good morning!"

[Taichi]
"How's it going?"

[Misato]
"Not too well."

[Taichi]
"That's a shame."

I took a look at the antenna.
There were steel frames, wires, tools, all kinds of
things... Why were they all up so high?!

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, so this is the fabled antenna, huh?"

I continued talking as I moved all the dangerous
items down from the roof.

[Misato]
"Umm...?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, I see what happened here..."

I took down all the tools and implements hanging
from the antenna, as well.

[Misato]
"Are you sleep-walking?"

[Taichi]
"Nope, I'm wide awake."
"Well then, see ya later!"

Misato saw me off in stunned silence.
Leaving at this point would mean she'd avoid
injury... At least, that was the plan.

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

She wouldn't get injured, but would this mess up the
timeline?

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

Even still, it was it to avoid the accident...

[Taichi]
*sigh*

In the end, these things couldn't be rushed.
