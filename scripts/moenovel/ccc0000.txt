My oldest memory is so faint and blurry.
A memory so fuzzy, I can barely remember.
I was in a luxurious room, filled with an aura of
aristocracy.
There was a canopied bed and European chairs.
But still, I preferred sitting on the floor.
Especially on these kind of days.
Beyond the window I saw only the black, starry
curtain of night.
I was captivated by the twinkling lights contained
in the frame of the window.
It was like my reflection was trapped in that glass
wall between the outside world and my room.
A maiden in her bower...
A graceful young girl dressed in a Western style
dress...
Who on earth are you?

[Girl]
"Taichi..."

Silver hair...transparent with a blurry outline.
Long and undulating, with tips like gentle waves,
it wrapped around her body.
Her face was small. Almost like a doll.
"I've never seen such a magical face as yours."
Who was it that said that?
Wife...or older sister...?
Her sweet voice was soothing to listen to.
My memories of when I was less than 10 years old
were faint and felt like a distant dream.
"Come here, let's play."
I never said no to that.
A little girl's clothes, a little girl's manners,
and a little girl's manner of speaking.
Being dressed up like an elegant little doll by the
owners and the staff in the mansion could sometimes
be boring but was never especially unpleasant.
I think it was something along those lines.
My reflection in the window. I always saw a little
girl.
There was one thing I did remember. Clearly.
Amongst a crowd of young little girls, there was one
child who didn't laugh.
That little girl never mistreated me.
I was always dressed up as a girl, forced to play
tea-party and such.
Out walking in the garden, she would scornfully
glance my way.
Her eyes had ink-black pupils like obsidian stone.
It made me uncomfortable.
Whenever she looked at me, I panicked.
Was it in delight, or in shame?
It could be both.
With little experience of the world, I had not yet
let my emotions run wild.
On the outside, I kept my composure. I always
smiled at the ladies of the house.
It was my role to discern between the two.
My role... Becoming a doll.
In order to live.
During my "doll era," I never spoke to her.
Not even once.
Seeing her alone and isolated had left a strong
impression on me.
Though I never realized until afterwards.
That she was just another doll picked out
with lavishly spent money.
I felt the air turn cold.
The cold air from the corridor.
I turned around and she was there, standing in the
doorway.
She just stood there.
The Isolated Princess...
But what had happened?
She was is in a bad shape.
No.
Someone had done this to her. In a really cruel way.
Her clothes were ripped, there were scratches on her
pale skin.
Black streaks of blood at the ends of her lips.
She stood there, violently shaking.
It was a shocking sight.
It was an absurd but happy doll era.
Her and I...never lived together...
My memories were all muddled up.
So...the fact...that she was here...
A loud wife and her daughter. Youthful servants.
The days of sweet sugary lollies, quickly passed by
in my memories.
Every scene lost its color and deteriorated
into a musky gray.
The era when she opened the door
and came into the room.
That wasn't during the doll era.
It was much later...
From a time when we both shared a single room.
From heaven to hell...
Grey marks outline where the furniture used to
stand.
The bed was shabby.
The sheets were covered in dirt.
None of the lights were covered with shades.
The floor boarding was in splinters.
The beautiful silk curtain looked no better
than a dirty floor cloth.
The painful, miserable path of human life gone too
fast.
It affected us, the two of us who never even spoke
to each other.

[Girl]
"Taichi."

That was my name.
In that house, the women took my name and made it
feminine.
Ichihime.
How elegant.
But the girl never called me that.

[Taichi]
"Do you want something to drink?"

Without responding to my question, she drew nearer.
Naturally, I then pushed her onto the bed.

[Girl]
"..."

She was close enough to touch.
Silence drifted in the gap between us.
I felt like I couldn't breathe properly.
There was a sweet smell.
It wasn't like perfume or soap.
It was the smell of her body.
She spoke with a gentle voice, like soft flower
petals.

[Girl]
"Everyday... It's hard for you, right?"

I thought for a while then answered.

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Girl]
"Does it hurt?"

[Taichi]
"It hurts."

[Girl]
"And no one helps you?"

[Taichi]
"No one helps, all the nice people are gone."

[Girl]
"You're wrong. There were no nice people, even
before."

Her tone of voice changed, her words were cold.
But there was no hatred nor hostility.
Only cold air.

[Taichi]
"But...the old masters..."

[Girl]
"Those people are nothing but weak"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Girl]
"Trying to fill the empty space in your heart, they
my appear kind."
"But they will run and leave at the first sign of
trouble."
"Leaving their precious toys behind..."

She placed both her hands on my shoulders.
She held on tight.

[Girl]
"No one is on your side. No one will help you.
Only you can protect yourself."

[Taichi]
"..."

That was true.
It was a sad reality.
But that was the truth.
Weak children became prey.
Unbelievably dark desires existed in this world.
Both her and I knew that.
We protected ourselves with wisdom, not strength.
Because "they" were our legal guardians.
But what if those guardians were the perpetrators?
We couldn't fight it.
This grand mansion and land it was on.
Whatever happened here would never reach the outside
world.
We were...
Birds in a cage.
Her pale hands gripped my cheeks.
She drew closer to me.
I felt my heart beat.
But her face was serious as she stroked my cheek.

[Girl]
"You got burnt by a cigarette...?"

[Taichi]
"A little."
"But I put cream on it beforehand."

You had to protect yourself with your own wisdom.

[Girl]
"Apologies."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Girl]
"For not helping you."

I was perplexed.

[Taichi]
"That's okay, you also..."

I couldn't say anything else.
She had endured harder times than me, as a girl.
She hugged me.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Girl]
"Taichi... Taichi."

Her voice shook.
This was unusual. She was usually cool-headed.

[Girl]
"Taichi..."

She pressed her lips against my ear and let out a
long sigh.
I felt an electric current run up my spine.
The area around my waist felt hot.

[Taichi]
"Hn?!"

All of sudden she touched me...down there.
My body twitched.

[Girl]
"Taichi, we're weak."

Her pupils were a brilliant jet-black.
I didn't know how to respond as she glared at me.

[Girl]
"So we have to join hands."

[Taichi]
"Hands?"

[Girl]
"As one body and mind."

[Taichi]
"One body and mind..."

[Girl]
"That way, we can put up with it no matter how hard
it is."
"I am Taichi, and Taichi is me."

It became quiet as she alternated her words around.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

Surprise, confusion, and a hint of shame.
Mixed it all up, and I forgot my actions.

[Girl]
"Tai..chi..."

A sweet wetness.
She melted my frozen body.
Our lips parted and she removed her clothes.
I took a deep breath in.
Her bare skin was like moonlight, innocent.
Her elegant daintiness.
She looked like a living sculpture, her limbs bathed
in the silvery light.
Her body was covered with tiny scars.
Despite that.
I found beauty.

[Girl]
"I am Taichi, and Taichi is me."

Those words were engraved in my memory.
As I looked into her eyes, I saw a sort of a change
in her.

[Girl]
"Sorry..."
"You can only believe in yourself."

Her delicate fingertips slid over my chest.
It tickled as she touched my bare skin.

[Taichi]
"Youko..."

That was her name.
At last, I spoke.
I would be lying if I said I didn't remember what
happened.
For her it was an oath, for me it was a symbol of
our unity.
Ideal.
Cooperation.
The product of a fleeting love, I was lost in the
moment.
But even so...
We kept at it.
We connected.
