I remember when Touko first came to Gunjo.
She built a wall around herself.
A wall as high as she could make it.
I liked her from the first moment I saw her.
With my cat-like nature all I wanted to do was climb
those walls.

[Taichi]
"HEY!"

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Are you rich?"

[Touko]
"..."

She ignored me.

[Taichi]
"HEY!"

[Touko]
"What."

[Taichi]
"You're pretty."

[Touko]
"..."

Her face cramped up a little.
And just from that, I came to know what she was
like.
And even now, it was like Touko hadn't even changed
at all.
Week in, week out.
I always came to see her.
But every time, I never saw anything close to
happiness from her.
Touko and I, locked into the same pattern every time.
I failed each time. It was so pathetic I could
laugh.
Maybe she needed something that wasn't even words.
Maybe she just needed to see something.
Something she could bond with.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"What do you want?!"

She suddenly stood up.

[Taichi]
"You're really pretty."

[Touko]
"Wh-wha-wha-wha-?!"

[Taichi]
"Hahahahah."

She kicked me out.

[Taichi]
"Nope. Not this time..."

She was so difficult.

[Taichi]
"The same outcome as normal, huh?"

Oh well.
Guess, I'll just take it easy.
Touko was daydreaming in the classroom as usual.
Just there, without a purpose.
Because there was nothing else she could do.
It was like she was stuck there.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

She was caught off guard when I called her by her
first name.

[Taichi]
"Put both your hands out."

[Touko]
"No."

Good. She took the bait.

[Taichi]
"I can imagine that you'd want to be cautious."
"But this time it's different."

[Touko]
"You said that the last time too!"
"I won't be fooled again."

[Taichi]
"There is nothing to worry about."

[Touko]
"You're going to make me grab your thing, 
aren't you?"

[Taichi]
"It's not like that. I just want a little handshake."

[Touko]
"No!!"

Hm, she was a tough one.
I might have to force her.

[Taichi]
"Hand."

I took her hand by force.
I had an impulse to make her grab IT, but I
suppressed it.

[Touko]
"Hey..."

Her face showed the colors of fear.
She thought something was going to happen to her.
Maybe I wanted to. But I didn't.

[Taichi]
"Here, why don't you try the taste of mom's
cooking."

*drop drop drop*
Three candy balls rolled around her palm.

[Touko]
"Ah!"

[Taichi]
"Relax. Wonderful two hundred-million-dollar life,
just relax."

[Touko]
"Your English is broken."

[Taichi]
"Well, anyways, it's really just some candy."

[Touko]
"Why wouldn't they be."

Touko held the candy balls.
Tightly.

[Taichi]
"Your body should be content with the sugar content
for the time being."

Three jokes in a row...

[Taichi]
"Even if you have no appetite, just keep trying to
eat at least."

Touko stared at her fist.

[Touko]
"You're always like that."
"You act friendly, stupid, cold and scary, all at
once."
"I don't get it."

She hid her face.

[Touko]
"Just leave me alone. Please."

[Taichi]
"All right..."

She was pretty angry.
But I had achieved my goal one way or another.

[Taichi]
"Just pretending to be nice, huh."

It was halfhearted, but it was to the point.
Touko had been like that last year too.
And me, I did my own usual thing.
Taichi Kurosu's Touko-teasing continued.
No one else even tried to talk to her other than me.
There wasn't any ill will.
There were plenty of students that couldn't hold a
conversation at Gunjo. Touko was just another that
rejected people.
Everyone was sensitive to that ill will.
But I fed off of it.

[Taichi]
"Touko, did you have lunch yet?"

[Touko]
"I don't want any..."

*growl*

[Taichi]
"But... Your stomach is growling."

[Touko]
"Shut up!"

[Taichi]
"You're cute when you're upset. It suits you when
your face is full of anger."

I said it just like someone would say:
"You're cute when you laugh. Your smile suits you."

[Touko]
"Shut. Up."

No sign of advancement.

[Taichi]
"You don't even have a lunch box. Even though you're
rich."

[Touko]
"I don't need it..."

[Taichi]
"Aww."

I ate my lunch right in front of her.
*growl*

[Touko]
"..."

Her face went red.

[Taichi]
"Hey, you probably don't even know how the cafeteria
works, huh."

Touko had her face down but eventually she nodded
slightly.

[Touko]
"I was always in a dorm."

[Taichi]
"So it was either the dorm or the butler."

[Touko]
"Why do I have to stand in line to have a meal...
It doesn't make sense."

[Taichi]
"I never thought I'd hear someone say that,
that's amazing."

She certainly wasn't an ordinary person, that was for
sure.

[Taichi]
"All right, come with me."

I took her by the hand.

[Touko]
"H-huh? N-no, it's okay..."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it. I try to be nice to 
pretty people."

[Touko]
"Y-you and your shameless compliments..."

[Taichi]
"I think you'd enjoy life more if you opened your
heart a little more, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Let's go."

[Touko]
"H-hey wait?!"

It was one-sided, but I tried to give her support.
...

[Taichi]
"You got in trouble with the teacher again?"

[Touko]
"What does it matter to you, anyways."

[Taichi]
"You don't even wear the uniform here."

[Touko]
"Whatever, I don't even want to be a student here
anyway."

[Taichi]
"But the test led you to here, right?"

[Touko]
"That test..."

[Taichi]
"It means that there's a possibility
that you'll hurt someone."

[Touko]
"I've never done such a thing."

[Taichi]
"I think so too."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"I think so too."

If Touko has ever hurt someone...
It would be herself.
...

[Taichi]
"Do you hate Gunjo, Touko?"

[Touko]
"Of course I hate it. Because I'm normal."
"I'm not even joking."

[Taichi]
"Is that right? I have fun here."
"It's relaxed."

[Touko]
"How can it? Being watched every day... Being
treated like an abnormal kid."

[Taichi]
"But no need to be frightened by it."

[Touko]
"...I don't want anything to do with all this."

[Taichi]
"Then do you hate me too?"

[Touko]
"I really hate you."

[Taichi]
"Hahahahah."

...

[Taichi]
"You...are really are alone, aren't you?"
"You can't make friends like this."

[Touko]
"I don't need any."

[Taichi]
"Do you want to join the broadcasting club?"

[Touko]
"No..."

[Taichi]
"Hmm, it's so fun."

[Touko]
"Why are you inviting me? There's plenty of others
out there."

[Taichi]
"Because I want you to join."

[Touko]
"W-why..."

[Taichi]
"Because I like you."

[Touko]
"How troublesome..."

I tried to telepathically transmit good feelings to
her.
Harmless. Ally. Friendly. Likable.
I wondered if it would work.
...
One day, Touko asked me.

[Touko]
"Why are you here, Kurosu?"

[Taichi]
"Because my mind is ill."

[Touko]
"It doesn't look that way."

[Taichi]
"Just in the parts you can't see."

In the parts I didn't show.
Touko held her head.

[Touko]
"I can't stand this place anymore..."
"It's scary... This school... I want to go back..."

Where did she want to go back to?
It probably wasn't her old school.
She wanted to return to her past days.

[Taichi]
"It's all right. It's fun once you get used to it."

[Touko]
"I can't."

[Taichi]
"You just decided that by yourself, right?"
"You're cute, Kirihara. If you wanted to,
you could enjoy yourself here."

[Touko]
"I-I'm not talking about that."

[Taichi]
"Cute, you're cute."

I caressed her head gently.

[Touko]
"Stop it! Idiot!"

She shook me off.
Would her ears be red if she really hated it?

[Taichi]
*murmur*

...In my dream... Touko...

[Taichi]
*murmur*

I opened my eyes.
The sun pierced through the window.
I couldn't recall a single dream. I must have slept
soundly.
It was seven o'clock.
Time for school.
I dropped by the classroom.
Touko was there.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Touko]
"Hmph!"

[Taichi]
"You don't look so well."

[Touko]
"None of your business, Kurosu."

So cold.

[Taichi]
"Why do you still come to school?"

[Touko]
"That's none of your business too."

[Taichi]
"I know why."
"You want someone to talk to you."

[Touko]
"No...!"

She raised her voice.

[Taichi]
"That's why I talked to you."

[Touko]
"What are you... You're just thinking that
on your own."

[Taichi]
"You haven't had food in two days. You can't just
live off water."
"Take this."

I gave Touko a lunch box.

[Touko]
"What is this?"

[Taichi]
"It's not like it's full of panties or something..."

[Touko]
"I can't trust you at all."
"The only things going around in your head are
either perverted or copyrighted material!"

[Taichi]
"Hey...I think about other things too, sometimes..."

I was shocked.

[Taichi]
"It's full of food, you know."
"There's a sandwich and a sweet bun inside."
"The sweet bun has been steamed."

[Touko]
"I don't want it... Don't need it."

[Taichi]
"You do need it. Eat it."

*shove*
I shoved the sweet bun towards her.

[Touko]
"Stop it..."

She roughly pushed my hands away.
The sweet bun fell on the ground.
I picked it up.
I tore off the portion that had touched the ground
and ate it.
I handed the rest back to her.

[Touko]
"You..."

It was a secret move that'll make even your foes
sympathetic.
It was mega effective!

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Touko]
"Ah..."

She accepted it.
She just held the sweet bun and gave me a blank
look.

[Taichi]
"It's tough having to look out for yourself, right?"

[Touko]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"You want others to worry about you."
"You want to feel fulfilled."

[Touko]
"..."

She became silent.

[Taichi]
"I'm a little worried about you."

She glared at me.

[Touko]
"You got some nerve."
"If you're worried, then why, why?!"

She began to lose her temper.

[Taichi]
"I wasn't trying to make you angry or anything."

*slap*
She staggered.
Her slap didn't hurt at all.

[Touko]
"Oooo..."

She squatted down after her attack.

[Taichi]
"You all right?"

[Touko]
"Hn..."

Her face was frighteningly pale. It was like the
color was draining from her eyes.

[Taichi]
"Touko..."

I crouched down next to her.

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me like you know me..."

She barely managed to force the words out.

[Taichi]
"Let's call a truce. It's an emergency."

[Touko]
"I can't see..."

[Taichi]
"It's okay. Your blood circulation was just bad."

[Touko]
"I feel sick... I might puke..."

[Taichi]
"Do you need to?"

[Touko]
"No..."

[Taichi]
"Lie on your side, here."

I offered my lap as a pillow.

[Touko]
"Hm... My head, it's spinning... I feel...dizzy..."

[Taichi]
"You'll be able to see soon."

[Touko]
"How would you know that. You don't know anything
about medical science."

[Taichi]
"But I know about you."

[Touko]
"Oh..."

[Taichi]
"Are you getting your vision back?"

[Touko]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"It's just anemia. It'll happen sometimes."

[Touko]
"It's getting a little better..."

[Taichi]
"Open your mouth."

[Touko]
"No, you're going to do something strange."

[Taichi]
"It's water. I promise."
"I'll help you drink it."

[Touko]
"..."

She opened her mouth.
I poured.

[Touko]
"Arrgh?!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, sorry."

[Touko]
"It's fine, I'll drink it myself! Hand it here!"
*gulp gulp gulp*

Touko drank the whole thing, like an office worker,
trying to drink their troubles away.
It seemed to have stimulated her stomach.
*growl*

[Touko]
"That's... Not what you think."

[Taichi]
"I know."
"I know, so let's eat."

[Touko]
"..."

She simply turned red.
A while after, Touko was able to eat lunch at 
the cafeteria.

[Touko]
"I'll stand in line this time."

She actually said that.
She was used to the cafeteria now.
But Touko still hid behind my back.
Because there were strange people around.
I did everything for her.
Touko's job was to hold the seats.
But even that was still hard for her.

[Taichi]
"You... Are going to stand in line?"

[Touko]
"You're always standing in line for me... So I'll
stand in line today."

She took the meal ticket and headed towards the
counter.

[Taichi]
"Well now..."

[Touko]
"It's stale..."

[Taichi]
"It's from this morning."

[Touko]
"It's too big to eat."

[Taichi]
"I guess it was made for me."

[Touko]
"There's too much mustard."

[Taichi]
"I love spicy foods."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Does it taste bad?"

[Touko]
"It's delicious..."

[Taichi]
"Then take your time."

[Touko]
*sniffle*

She began to sob.

[Taichi]
"Take your time, let your stomach catch up."
"There's another sweet bun, do you want it?"

[Touko]
"I do..."

[Taichi]
"The people in your house prepared food for you,
right?"

[Touko]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"What are you going to do, now that they are gone?"

[Touko]
"There is nothing that I can do. No food will be
served."

[Taichi]
"That does not bode well for you, especially since
you can't cook."

[Touko]
"How... Did you know that I can't cook...?"

[Taichi]
"Don't let that bother you."

[Touko]
"It bothers me..."

[Taichi]
"How do you feel?"

[Touko]
"...A little better."

[Taichi]
"Come to me if you get hungry again."
"I don't have caviar or anything, but I got stuff
like potatoes."

[Touko]
"But..."

I knew what she wanted to say.
She was afraid of betrayal.

[Taichi]
"Anyhow..."
"Why do you think humankind ended?"

I looked out the window.
I asked her without expecting any real answer.

[Touko]
"It didn't."
"There was no one here in the first place."
"If I set my hopes low, I'll never be disappointed."
"It's just easier that way."

[Taichi]
"Is that the same reason you ignored me?"

I looked at her.
Touko looked away.

[Touko]
"Yes."
"And even though you knew it, you still tried to
talk to me. What's wrong with you?!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

[Touko]
"Why are you apologizing!"
"I can't understand you at all, Taichi..."

Anguish.
Time passed.
I carried the potatoes to the yard.
I remembered a tip I had picked up from a survival
comic, I could use the rice cooker to cook the
potatoes.

[Taichi]
"It's ready..."

Steaming was a hassle so I had decided to bake them.
Potatoes for two.
I waited.
Somebody had fallen down by the front door.
Touko Kirihara.

[Touko]
"Unnh..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I carried Touko.

[Touko]
"... T-Taichi...?"

I took her in.

[Touko]
"Ah, ow..."

I let her sit.
Then put potatoes in her mouth.

[Touko]
"Ummm, urggm?!"
"I can eat it myself!!"

She yelled, spitting potatoes everywhere.
*munch munch munch*

[Taichi]
"Here, some salt."

[Touko]
"Yeah, please."

[Taichi]
"Here..."

Touko ate with gusto.

[Touko]
"Ah..."

Her limbs went stiff.
Just as I had planned... (Not really).

[Taichi]
"Here, water."

I passed her a water bottle.

[Touko]
*gulp gulp gulp*

She drank it all up.

[Touko]
"Uh...uh..."

She started eating again.
She went for a seventh one, then an eighth,
then she finally caught her breath.

[Touko]
"Now I can relax..."

[Taichi]
"That's great."

Touko corrected her posture.

[Touko]
"Thank you for the meal."

[Taichi]
"No worries."

[Touko]
"And... Thank you again."

It felt awkward.

[Taichi]
"Anyhow, take a look at this."

[Touko]
"What's this?"

[Taichi]
"It's canned food."

[Touko]
"Uh-huh."

[Taichi]
"It's preserved food. You can just open it, and you
have food you can eat."

[Touko]
"Ah, I see..."
"Where can you find it?"

[Taichi]
"Places like convenience stores."

[Touko]
"Convenience stores...?"

[Taichi]
"You don't even know convenience stores!"

[Touko]
"I-I do know... I've just never seen one."

[Taichi]
"Whoaa!!"

I was shocked.
I fell down.

[Touko]
"Wha?! Wh-what?"

[Taichi]
"I can't believe what a rich girl you are."

[Touko]
"Eh... Is that so... I don't really know...?"
"Anyway, there's no point in talking about money
anymore..."

[Taichi]
"Well, that's true."
"Oh man, I should've come to wed you
when I still had the chance."

She seemed offended by my words.

[Touko]
"That's such an ill motive..."

[Taichi]
"You're the one that tried to sneakily introduce me
to your parents!"

[Touko]
"I did... But you ran away."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's true..."
"Besides, I'm on Gunjo's most wanted list."
"There's no way even your godfather would've
accepted me."

[Touko]
"But you're not weird, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"If you still think that, then you still have ways
to go."
"You have a lot to learn."

[Touko]
"You said something like that last time too."
"I don't even know what I need to learn... I guess
I'm pretty clueless."
"If you're kind to me, then that's all I need..."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

[Touko]
"It's a hassle. Having to put effort in just to
live."

[Taichi]
"Touko, you would never survive on your own."

[Touko]
"Shut it..."

[Taichi]
"Bastard..."

[Touko]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"Can I live here?"

[Taichi]
"No problem."

[Touko]
"I see... Huh, wait. I-I can?"

[Taichi]
"It's fine."

[Touko]
"I-I'll bring some spare clothes."

[Taichi]
"I already have laundry supplies so you don't need
to bring those."

[Touko]
"Urrgghh?!"

She came back quickly.
She had brought so much stuff that her bag was
completely full.
She was sweating profusely, and her knees were
shaking.
I remembered the time I had teased her about not
holding anything heavier than chopsticks.
Then she had replied to me saying that she held
knives and forks. With a straight face.

[Taichi]
"You overdid yourself."

[Touko]
"There was too much for me to bring by myself."

As she explained, she used her hands to demonstrate,
and her eyes lit up.
I really found that kind of thing cute about her.

[Taichi]
"Let's use a car tomorrow."

[Touko]
"Do you have a license?"

[Taichi]
"It's not like we need one anymore..."

[Touko]
"Ah, right..."
"Anyway, I have enough clothes for one night, it's
still okay if I stay, right?"

[Taichi]
"You'd like a separate room, right?"

[Touko]
"I'd prefer to be in the same room..."

[Taichi]
"It's small so don't complain."

[Touko]
"Small is fine... So I can stick close..."

[Taichi]
"What...?"

[Touko]
"N-nothing..."

Touko turned her face away, probably because her
face was turning red (It was dark so I couldn't see
for sure).
Jeez, such a flirt.
But that's when I showed that I was an adult
and calmly replied.

[Taichi]
"A-all right then, th-there's nothing to do s-so
let's get some s-s-sleep."

Waaaaaah!
I had to calm down...

[Touko]
"Uh, Um..."

[Taichi]
"Hm? Yes? What is it?"

[Touko]
"I want to take a bath."

[Taichi]
"Uhh, the bathtub has water in it...
If that's okay with you."

Water was quite precious right now, but I guess I
had enough to last until the end of the week.

[Touko]
"That's fine, I'll use that water then."

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

I sat on the bed and contemplated.
Damn.
She meant to do it.
It was so easy to tell.
She was so simple it was cute.
A heart of gold.
It just showed how pure she was.
It was a tough situation.
What to do...
There was only one answer.
I knew I had to refrain.
She needed to be herself. No attachments. For her
sake.
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to be living
together.
Of course, I did feel the urge.
But it wouldn't be good to act on it.
These days were just that. A holy battle.

[Touko]
"Taichi..."

She came back.

[Taichi]
"Touko..."

[Touko]
"I'm all clean now..."

I felt that if I stood up, she would suddenly jump
to embrace me.
Like some TV drama.
There was a stupid couple that lived in a nearby
apartment. They always kept breaking up and getting
back together.
They argued enough to have complaints from the
neighbors, but they always got back together so
quickly.
I never thought I'd be like them.
And now Touko was in front of me, blushingly saying,
"I'm all clean now" to me.

[Taichi]
"Yep. All clean..."

I gave her my best smile.

[Taichi]
"Then, here you go."

I gave her a sleeping bag.

[Touko]
"Hey, what's this thing?"

It was in a cylinder shape since I had rolled it up
in its cover.

[Taichi]
"You may not know about it, but it's called a
sleeping bag, you can sleep inside it."

A question mark was dancing over Touko's head.

[Touko]
"Why would you sleep inside a bag?"

[Taichi]
"You can use it to sleep comfortably on the floor.
Isn't that great, Touko?"

[Touko]
"But there's a bed right here..."

[Taichi]
"This is mine."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

Our eyes met.

[Touko]
"I'm not sure what you're trying to say..."

[Taichi]
"I said you could stay here, but I didn't promise
anything else."
"All right then, good night!"

I sunk myself into the soft bed.
It was dark and there was nothing else to do but
sleep.

[Touko]
"Um, hey... We haven't...we didn't..."

[Taichi]
*zzz*

[Touko]
"Wh-what..."

[Taichi]
*zzz*

[Touko]
"Stupid moron, idiot Taichi."

[Taichi]
*zzz*

*rustle*
I heard the sound of the sleeping bag unfolding.
I heard her slide into it.

[Touko]
"Uhh... The floor...so hard..."

I could hear her complaining on the floor.

[Touko]
"..."
"So hot! There's no way I can sleep in this thing."
"Fine then, I'll just sleep on the floor..."
*sniff* "The floor, it's so hard..."

She whimpered till she fell asleep.

[Taichi]
"...Jeez, enough already..."

I couldn't sleep until after Touko fell asleep.
And yet...
I lifted my hand to wipe the tears from the corner
of my eye.
When I awoke, Touko was asleep on the floor.
She had an expression of anguish.

[Touko]
*groan*

I felt a little bad for her.
It looked as if she was having a bad dream.
Anyhow, I got dressed and headed for school.
A gate to prevent escape.
Instead of protecting the students, it was more to
protect the outside world from us.
That was the impression it gave me.
Like a typical delinquent, I put my legs up on the
desk.
I rocked my chair back and forth.
There was nothing to do. It was really boring.

[Touko]
"Taichi..."

Touko came, very late.
She was out of breath.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're late."

[Touko]
"I looked for you... Everywhere..."

[Taichi]
"I see, is that why you were late?"
"Late! Late!"

I teased her and she gave me an angry look.
Well, she might have given me that look no matter
what.

[Touko]
"Why did you come here alone! Why didn't you wake
me?!"

[Taichi]
"Because you were asleep."

[Touko]
"You should wake me up!"

[Taichi]
I thought about it.
"Sorry, I didn't think about it."

Touko bent at the knees.

[Touko]
"I...think I'm gonna cry..."

[Taichi]
"Crybaby."
"Anyhow, let's go find some food, I'm hungry."

[Touko]
*sigh*

The two of us went out to look for food.
We checked houses and shops nearby.
Searching for something to eat.
There were so many things Touko didn't know about.
We had to avoid raw produce, so all we could find
was prepackaged food and other types of dry food.
It took a long time, because I had to explain to
Touko about each and every item.
But by the time we had a cheap lunch ready to eat,
she was back in good mood.
