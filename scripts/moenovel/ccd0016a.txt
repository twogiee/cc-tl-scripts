[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri glared at me while I brushed myself clean.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

Why not start with her?

[Kiri]
"What is it...?"

She gave a response that matched her cold
expression.
I stood before her.
I was a head taller than her, but she met my gaze
without hesitance.
I liked her spirit.

[Taichi]
"Hiyaaaah!"

Open sesame!

[Kiri]
"???"
"Wait, what? Whaaat?"
"Why won't it come down? Why? Why?"

Kiri struggled to push her skirt back down.
But her skirt refused to cooperate.

[Kiri]
"M-my skirt! It just keeps floating! What's going
on?!"

[Miki]
"I think we just witnessed the discovery of a
mysterious power..."

[Taichi]
"It's my ultimate winning move."

[Kiri]
"Aaaahhhhhhhhh..."

Faster and faster.
Ruffling and furling.

[Kiri]
"I-it won't stop!"

[Taichi]
"Now."

I looked at Miki.

[Miki]
"Erhm..."

[Taichi]
"Here's an early Christmas present for a girl who
loves miniskirts."

[Miki]
"Ah... Y-you're gonna do that to me too...?"

She turned to run away.

[Miki]
"Ah... No... Please forgive me!"

[Taichi]
"Hm..."

Ugh, she was so helpless.

[Taichi]
"I wanted to overlook you, but... Forgive me."

[Miki]
"Waaah, T-Taichi, calm down..."

I put my fingers on the hem of her skirt.

[Miki]
"My beloved Taichi wouldn't do such a thing to me,
would he?"

She gazed intently at me.

[Taichi]
"..."

Miki's maiden cries stirred my heart.
Ah, but I also wanted to defile Miki at the
same time.
I wanted to destroy what I loved.
To torment my object of affection.
Male instincts always made things more complicated.

[Miki]
"Why must people always fight?!"

Grrr, she was right.
Though her point had nothing to do with it,
it was an appropriate question.
Miki's pure words brought me to my senses.

[Taichi]
"I understand, Miki."

[Miki]
"Oh thank goodness, Taichi."

I decided to make nice with Kiri as well.

[Taichi]
"Ohh, I'm so sorry, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Sorry my ass!!"
