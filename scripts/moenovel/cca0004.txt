"Morning..."

I stood up.
My room was the same as ever.
I stopped my blaring alarm clock.

[Taichi]
*yawn*

It was September, after summer break.
In the summer heat, my room was boiling hot.
I blearily changed clothes, and blearily grabbed my
bag.
On the table was a sandwich in plastic wrap.
It looked like it had eggs, potatoes, and veggies.
I ate it gratefully.

[Taichi]
*chomp*

It was, indeed, delicious.
For I, who lacked even the most basic household
skills, this was like a gift from the heavens.
I wouldn't have to raid the convenience store on the
way to school now.

[Taichi]
"I thank you for the delicious food, yet again."

I faced east, folded my hands and bowed my head.
Right, school time.
I looked up at the sky.
I wondered what the weather would be like today...
The air felt strangely dry, giving me the impression
today would be just fine.
And the usual warm, humid seaside winds were
behaving themselves.
I wasn't exaggerating before when I said Kamisaka
City was hilly.
And on my way to school I needed to get over several
of these hills.
Going to school was a series of ups and downs, quite
literally.
The path reflected the tribulations of life. It made
me tired in both body and soul.

[Taichi]
"So...tired..."

Being used to the climb didn't stop it from taking
everything out of me each morning.
But those who walked it should consider themselves
lucky.
Trying to get over all these hills on a bike was
really rough.
Bikes were made for flat terrain.
The climbs were easier on foot, and the rides down
were mere fleeting moments of bliss on pedals.
It wouldn't be hyperbolic to say that the journey
was a sort of a mild form of torture.
At the top of the slope there was an intersection
leading into a small shopping street.
There were also apartments up here, and this was
where Miki Yamanobe lived.
Miki was in the year below me at school.
Her hair looked just like the kind of hair a fantasy
wizard would have.
And by sheer coincidence this look really suited
her.
It really did make her look like a wizard.
Of course she couldn't use magic, but people did
call her a "wizard with words."
It was hard to stop her from starting up a
conversation, and once she had started it was even
harder to get her to stop.
And she had the audacity to match my vocabulary
range, which kept me from getting bored of listening
to her.
She could often be found with another first-year
club member, Kiri Sakura.
Miki, with her long hair, and Kiri, with her short
hair and androgynous looks.
With the two of them together, the place started to
look like a cute little flower garden.
So I called them the Flowers.
They were like the club mascots.
Miki loved miniskirts. She always wore one.
Plus, she was meek and cute. She was always down for
whatever.
I loved miniskirts, too. There's no reason we
wouldn't get along.
She had even promised to give me her uniform when we
would graduate.
I had offered her the second button of my jacket in
return, but she had politely refused.

[Taichi]
"Morning!"

I went into the small shop at the end of the strip.
-Tazaki Mart-

[Taichi]
"Hello?"

I called out to the back.
No one answered.

[Taichi]
"He must be out again..."

Tazaki Mart had been unstaffed for a while now.
The owner, Goichiro Tazaki (47, single), was an
incredible train nerd.
Often he would open up the shop, then leave to snap
pictures of trains in their natural habitat.
And the shop would just be left open.
So, basically, it was an unstaffed shop.
Maybe the shop was just like a hobby for him or
something.
Back in his 30s, he had looked so vicious people had
called him the "baby-killer," but after his parents
died, he changed and became all smiles.
Other than the inheritance, I wondered what could
have changed the wild man into a gentle train nerd.
Whatever the case, the kind old man now ran a shop
that kept a tab with no limits, and had become an
irreplaceable part of the neighborhood.
I took out my notepad and began writing.
-Sep. 7, Green Tea: 130 yen,
Taichi Kurosu
I used some tape to stick my note to the wall.
I saw that several others were already there.

[Taichi]
"Oh, Miki's already been and gone!"

-Sep. 3, Healthy GoGo Vegetable Juice: 110 yen,
Miki Yamanobe
-Sep. 3, Magnum Lychee: 110 yen,
Hiroshi Sakuraba
@"It's hot and spicy."
-Sep. 4, Bottled Water: 140 yen,
Misato Miyasumi
-Sep. 5, Healthy GoGo Vegetable Juice: 110 yen,
Miki Yamanobe
-Sep. 5, King du Doria: 110 Yen,
Hiroshi Sakuraba
@"It wasn't very good."
-Sep. 6, Healthy GoGo Vegetable Juice: 110 yen,
Miki Yamanobe
-Sep. 6, Pepper Policeman: 110 yen,
Kiri Sakura
-Sep. 7, Healthy GoGo Vegetable Juice: 110 yen,
Miki Yamanobe
Miki was buying too much!
She was going to regret it all once the bill came
due.
And no one needed Sakuraba's reviews.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

There was one more pasted behind that idiot
Sakuraba's.
Was someone hiding it?
Now I was interested.
-Sep. 6 Bottled Water x 3: 420 yen,
Kirihara
Welly well...
The Empress was thirsty! For three at once!
How embarrassing for the well to do! How utterly
plebeian!
I moved it to the most visible spot.
*slap*

[Taichi]
"That'll do it. Now..."

I went deeper into the shop and got a bottle of
green tea.

[Taichi]
"Put it on my tab, barkeep!"

I left.
Wetting my throat with tea, I continued on to
school.

[Taichi]
"Welly well!"

Someone had beaten me to the classroom.
She was in a seat by the window.
The girl, elbows on the desk, glanced around.

[Touko]
"..."

She looked outside, not saying a word.

[Taichi]
"You grace us with your presence early today."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And out of uniform, as well..."
"Aren't you hot in those clothes?"

[Touko]
"..."

She ignored me.

[Taichi]
"All right, all right."

I shrugged, and sat down in the seat next to Touko.
She was prickly as a porcupine.
And lately, it was like she'd been sharpening her
quills.
She was like this to everyone, so I didn't take it
personally.
Although it did seem that, for me at least, her
quills were poisoned as well.
Maybe I was just imagining it.
Maybe I was just too self-conscious.
But...
But still...
Just thinking about it...
A seizure? Here it comes...

[Taichi]
"Not good. Oh no no no..."

It passed. Just a small one. Nothing to worry
about...
I swallowed back the bile in my throat, fought my
trembling, and forced my mind clear.
I cleared the air with a lick of my perverse tongue.

[Taichi]
"Hey..."

[Touko]
"What?"

Touko answered, her tone clearly bored.

[Taichi]
"I can see your ass and raggedy panties."

[Touko]
"...!!"

She rushed to stand up, holding her behind with both
hands.

[Taichi]
"Gotcha!"

*wack*

[Taichi]
"Ugh."

I totally deserved that surprise slap.
Wipe-out.
I spun around beautifully.

[Taichi]
"Owowowow..."

Touko was already sitting again, as if she'd never
moved.

[Taichi]
"I was just messing with you."

[Touko]
"..."

It didn't look like she was in any mood to play.
She was the kind to put up walls.
But her walls were full of holes.
I dropped my bag on my desk, and looked around at
the empty classroom.
There was still some time until class started.
What to do...
