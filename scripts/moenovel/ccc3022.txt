All right then, club time.
I went to the restroom first.
...To the girls' restroom, naturally.
I looked at the mirror.
I could see my face in the reflection.
White hair.
Eyes with a unique design.
A hooked nose, if one were to ask.
It looked that way from my eyes.
Some said it looked orderly.
A girlish face.
Well, I guess so.
That was why "the incident" happened.
My opinion was different.
My face was somehow different, and eerie.
More like an adipocere, not a person.
A doll...
Hans Bellmer's jointed puppet.
I possessed some beauty, along with startling
ominousness and darkness.
Only people who preferred the darkness would
like me.
And I was also getting closer to the same darkness.
But I...preferred the norm.
What kind of ethics have people built
during the past?
A life so bright without darkness.
Wasn't that wrong...
Won't the darkness be too compressed?
Something born from everlasting darkness.
Could you call that a person?
I envied the people with dark black hair. I envied
them so much.
I even thought about dyeing it.
But hair grew quickly.
My hairline would show white roots in no time.
I felt so conscious of black hair with grays in it.
Just an ornament at the end.
Just like how I was just a decoration.
Eerie face.
Made me sick.
It could be from my own self-loathing.

[Taichi]
"..."

Ah, this wasn't a good mental state.
I felt what happened to Touko was too much of a good
thing.
I was falling in love with deterioration.
I couldn't sink too deep.
A sound came from one of the stalls.

[Taichi]
"..."

My feet moved without hesitation.

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

Kiri was in the stall.
She was dumbfounded.
She was pale.
She didn't look too well.
I positioned my arms as if I was blocking her path.
I'm not letting you escape, Kiri.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

A stagnant voice like a stranger.
My heart rapidly calmed down.
Regained serenity.
My vision slowed down.
Unable to judge small details.
My pupils must have been dilated.
Eyes that brilliantly shined in the darkness.
It was dim in there, surely Kiri saw it as well.
Kiri's fingers fidgeted.
Sensitively reacted.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Kiri]
"Ah, um..."

Strange atmosphere.
Kiri felt it too.
She was bewildered by my excessively calm voice.

[Kiri]
"I just wasn't...feeling well..."

[Taichi]
"That's not good."
"Are you okay?"

[Kiri]
"Yes... Um... I..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"Um... My period... The end of it
was getting severe..."

[Taichi]
"Oh. Is that so."
"I didn't know that."

She was frightened.
Glass-work.
Beautifully delicate.
Innocent.

[Taichi]
"How is it severe?"

[Kiri]
"My whole body is cranky... My cycle hasn't settled
yet..."

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's about right for somebody your age."

A beautiful lapis lazuli.

[Taichi]
"It's because your hormonal balance is immature
while on growth period."

My marble.

[Taichi]
"Your body is especially delicate, and seems to be
growing slowly."

Shattered when embraced.

[Kiri]
"I...see..."

It would grow and dull if not embraced.
Glass to a lump of earth.

[Taichi]
"Oh right."

And would lose its beauty.
Become normal. A normal girl.

[Taichi]
"So? Is it done?"

[Kiri]
"Yes... Soon..."

Kiri in the moment.

[Kiri]
"During it... I often get anemic..."

[Taichi]
"I see. So, when you say severe..."

Always beautiful.
Even in troubled or vigorous moments.

[Taichi]
"Even now?"

Even now.

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

Expression. Fear.
The stall filled with silent darkness.

[Taichi]
"Are you in pain now too?"

[Kiri]
"What...are you..."

I erased the faint smile I kept all this time.

[Taichi]
"Answer my question."

[Kiri]
"No..."

I fell for her.
I fell, so much that I wanted to touch it.
Impulse slowly rose.
There was conflict there.
But even thick paper had means of resisting.
She wasn't fit for it.

[Taichi]
"Answer me."

[Kiri]
"Just... Leave..."

Why have I neglected this fragile piece of art all
this time?

[Taichi]
"I'll go, if you answer me."

[Kiri]
"..."
"It's painful...now...too."

I could've left fingerprints if I carelessly touched
it.

[Taichi]
"Ahh, then."

I only moved my eyes and looked down.

[Taichi]
"Is that it, over there?"

[Kiri]
"Huh...?!"

Kiri was surprised.
She hadn't noticed.
Her senses must've been numb from nervousness.

[Taichi]
"It's thick..."

I saw it.
The blood.
In that mental state.
But.
It didn't matter.
I was going to make Kiri eternal.
Milk crown.
A mold of the moment created by a single drop.
The glass-made Kiri would most likely be shattered
in an instant.
Especially...

[Taichi]
"Thick blood."

[Kiri]
"Ah, aahh, no, noo..."

I got closer.

[Kiri]
"No, no no... Don't come near me..."

She shook like a kitten.

[Taichi]
"Have you ever thought about the number of kittens
that suffered and died on earth?"

I touched her thigh.
Thin skin. Fingertips sunk.
Like it was about to pierce through.
And pushed inside her body.

[Kiri]
"Hyaaaahh!"

Pain and shuddering.
Her voice shrieked.
So high and thin that it distorted audible sounds.

[Taichi]
"A cat gives birth to five kittens. One is taken in.
Lives a nice life. Happy ending."

Slid my fingers. Inside.

[Taichi]
"Two of them will die of cold and hunger. Suffering.
May not be sane at the end."
"One of them will wander somewhere, killed and
eaten by a wild dog. There may be minimal pain."
"It might give enough energy to the dog to kill
the mother cat and its siblings. But I can't say
for sure that it will come to that."

Raised my fingers up.
Thrusted towards Kiri.

[Kiri]
*huff huff*

Breathing very heavily.
Awful sweat.
Poor girl.

[Taichi]
"So what happened to the remaining kitten?"

[Kiri]
*huff huff*

Kiri's sight was fixated on my fingers.

[Taichi]
"It gets run over by a car and dies..."
"A kitten would be flat in an instant."
"No suffering, just meaninglessness."
"Meaningless death..."
"That's the kind of death."
"How many times has that repeated itself?"
"Open your mouth."

[Kiri]
"Fwah..."

The words didn't reach.

[Taichi]
"Could you open your mouth?"

[Kiri]
"Stop, this is awful."

She finally said that after all the things I've
done.

[Taichi]
"I won't do anything awful if you open it."
"Now, open wide."

Kiri obeyed.
I shoved my finger in.

[Kiri]
"Ugghhh!"

[Taichi]
"Lick it. Yes... That's right, good girl."

Pulled my fingers out.

[Taichi]
"The world is full of pain and sorrow..."
"It gets me really worried."
"That's why I want to connect. As soon as possible
and as long as possible."
"If I'm not connected, I can't figure out the norm
of living in this cruel world."
"But the contented people are completely blind."
"They say they aren't scared of loneliness. Their
face says it all, that they're able to fend for
themselves."
"Those people are shit."
"They don't know true loneliness, yet they have a
mindset to live normally."
"They're people of distant worlds."
"Distant from those like us with emotional
intelligence."
"It's fine while they're distant worlds away... But
they want to come closer and feed off of us, what
then?"
"You should know that well, Kiri."

I said, putting my face closer.

[Kiri]
"Ah, aah, aah..."

She was frayed.
I wondered if it was temporary.

[Taichi]
"You said it yourself. The world is scary."
"Justice is justice, only for them."
"There's nothing good left for us."
"But, we want to live...right?"

Approached my lips to her thigh, like a vampire.

[Kiri]
"Stop..."

Her legs pitifully shook.

[Kiri]
*sob* "Waaaaah..."

I stood up.
Kiri looked at me.
Afraid...and somewhat hostile.
Taking her steps for hatred.
Hate me all you want.
I could easily do it over.
Each of our own dignity all became nothing
when the weekend arrived.

[Taichi]
"..."

I leaned my back against the wall.
Lightly bit the back of her neck.

[Kiri]
"You... Monster..."

Her hateful words sounded with a lovely voice.
I was grinning.

[Kiri]
"You..."
"I'll... Kill you..."
"I'm going to... Kill you."

[Taichi]
"Hahah."

Put my weight on her.
Kiri closed her eyes shut.
Something was thrown into the stall
and let out a dry sound.
I looked.
A can was spinning in the air.
Two of them.
Two cans.
Bounced off the wall and fell to the ground.
It seemed like it was in slow motion.
My awareness sped up to the limit.
Cans don't fly, someone threw it.
Who? No need to think about it now. Thrown.
Intended. Someone threw it with intention.
For what purpose? What can be expected by throwing
a can? The can then showed its effect.
Explosive? Tossable weapon? Grenade-like.
Confined space. Increased destructiveness.
Death? Death. Death. Ranged attack. Cannot evade.
Positioning. I would die for sure. I would die.
Confirmed.
And Kiri?
Her mouth open. Eyes closed.
I embraced her head while holding on to her ear.
It was a small head.
Kiri was so cute.
A second felt like infinity.
In that infinity, I felt Kiri was precious.
Then they popped. Both at the same time.
The stall became white.
Loud sound. A pressure wave pushed my back.

[Kiri]
"?!"

Kiri cowered in my chest.
I didn't even have time to cower.
My eyes burned.
Ears numbed.
Everywhere felt stiff.
I couldn't move.
It...was death.
I felt some discomfort.
My senses were deprived.
Not being able to sense anything was so
disheartening.
I couldn't even grasp the situation.
Someone pulled the scruff of my neck.
I fell on my back.
Someone was propping me up.
Ah...
It was a familiar scent.
It never changed.
Her...faint sweetness.

[Youko]
"..."

Youko Hasekura...
I was being pulled to the hallway.

[Taichi]
"Ah... What was...?"

Finally able to speak again.
My body was somewhat strange.
It felt like my arms and legs were cramped.

[Youko]
"Flashbang..."

[Taichi]
"Flash... Bomb?"

[Youko]
"Also called stun grenade. A special type of hand
grenade."

[Taichi]
"I see."

Right.
I felt like I had seen it before.

[Taichi]
"From the old days..."

[Youko]
"Yes."

She gave a lovely smile.
Memories of her were filled with things like that.

[Youko]
"And I threw in two as a bonus..."

[Taichi]
"That doesn't make sense... At all."

[Youko]
"Are you...back to your senses?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah... I'm fine."

[Youko]
"I'm sorry... For being rough."

[Taichi]
"It's fine."

I guess it couldn't be helped.

[Taichi]
"But why did you even bother stopping?"

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It wasn't like I was in danger..."

Then I realized.
She didn't help me because I was in danger.
It was because Kiri and I were about to connect.
Moreover, in my purest way possible.
Jealousy.
It was just jealousy.
My feelings were withering away.

[Taichi]
"Why do you...deprive yourself?"

[Youko]
"Because..."

[Taichi]
"Because what?"
"You can live by yourself."
"You don't need me."

[Youko]
"I do need you..."
"I can't live without my other half."

[Taichi]
"I'm not the other half."

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

Without a logical answer, she just hugged my head.
And kissed me.
In an elegant manner.
I didn't resist.

[Youko]
"Can you stand up, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

My five senses were almost back.

[Taichi]
"My uniform is all dusty now."

[Youko]
"You reeked of sweat a little."

[Taichi]
"I've been wearing this everyday."

[Youko]
"..."

Expressionlessly shocked.

[Taichi]
"What, is that not normal?"

[Youko]
"Gross."

[Taichi]
"Then you can keep your distance."

[Youko]
"..."

She expressionlessly got sad.

[Taichi]
"Besides, Touko was wearing the same clothes
everyday too."

[Youko]
"She just had several of the same clothes..."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Kiri]
"Ugh..."

Kiri stumbled out.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi... Kurosu."

She glared, as if she was looking on her enemy.
What else could I have expected?

[Kiri]
"How dare you..."
"How, how dare you!"

They weren't tears of grief.
It was an emotion possessed by someone
who was oppressed, toyed with, and violated.
Absolute anger...
Righteously so.

[Kiri]
"I knew it... You... You two both..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"..."

Youko pulled out a knife.
A large knife.
Kiri's face became pale.

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Youko]
"She's full of hatred, it's a threat for Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Are you going to break our promise?"

[Youko]
"But..."

[Kiri]
"After all this time."

She cut in.

[Kiri]
"Even...if I live, you would just feed off of me!"

[Taichi]
"I don't have much to make an excuse, but..."
"I'm sorry!"

A quality apology, singing my own praise.
Kiri was flabbergasted for a moment. But quickly
filled with disgrace.

[Kiri]
"I don't understand..."
"What is that... What are you?"
"I can't understand it, not at all!"
"Just... Fine..."

Held her arms, confused, and walked away.

[Taichi]
"Wait, hold on."

Silence.

[Youko]
"Taichi... You're digging in too deep."

A voice from behind as I tried to run after her.

[Taichi]
"So what. It's going to be reset again anyhow."
"My own time here is meaningless."
"I need to do more things to add info to my journal."

[Youko]
"If that was your only motive then I'd understand
but that's not the case for you."
"You give too much care to broken toys, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Do you think I can face only you until I die?"

[Youko]
"Yes, just like old days..."

[Taichi]
"Without connecting to anyone else."
"Forever, in a small ring..."

[Youko]
"Big or small is subjective."
"There's not a big difference between living with
100 family members and just me."
"I think your standards are focused too much
on what the norm is."
"What you need comes from your own analysis."

[Taichi]
"What's wrong with being normal..."

[Youko]
"It doesn't suit you, Taichi."
"They are toys only for a short time."
"They won't last. They'll come to an end quickly."
"You're going to want to end it."

[Taichi]
"..."

Perhaps that was true.
Just like earlier.
I got what she was trying to tell me.
But.

[Taichi]
"I'm going to do as I please this week."

[Youko]
"Okay..."

[Taichi]
"You can go home today."

[Youko]
"You don't have to shove me away..."

[Taichi]
"I'm saying you don't have to watch over me.
Because no matter what kind of danger I encounter,
tomorrow is Sunday. A day to start fresh."

[Youko]
"Our own time..."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Youko]
"Just like you're living your own time now,
I'm also living my own time."
"The person standing in front of you is me, now.
Of course, but..."
"My own desire at this time is different
from next week's time."
"So, um..."

She strongly urged.

[Youko]
"We perish, every week."
"We perish individually. Which means..."
"We are not the same, we are different every week..."

[Taichi]
"!!!"

The same thought as me.

[Youko]
"I don't care about what happens to me
in the other weeks..."

Tears.

[Youko]
"In all the possibilities, will there ever be a time
where you'll be nice to me?"

[Taichi]
"I...don't know."

[Youko]
"I didn't see that pattern in the notebook."
"I just vanish before I fulfill my desire..."

[Taichi]
"Let's talk about that later."

[Youko]
"There is no later."
"I'll vanish while being broken."
"It just becomes good-bye."

[Taichi]
"Okay..."

[Youko]
"I'm sorry... I won't bother you anymore..."

I turned around.

[Youko]
"But write this down."

She recited from behind.

[Youko]
"Wherever you go, there is no one who will ever
understand you."

Those words set in my stomach like a heavy rock.

[Taichi]
"..."

I saw her off until she became as small as a seed.
I didn't hate her.
But her desires had too much contradiction.
It seemed like our lines would never connect
with each other.
