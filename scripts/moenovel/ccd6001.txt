I arrived at the cafeteria.
Sakuraba was eating curry rolls.
He was simple. Very simple.
I just had to keep him here till Sunday.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"Hmm?"

[Taichi]
"Meet at my place on Sunday morning."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay. You can count on me."

I couldn't count on him. At all.
I opened my eyes.
The sun pierced through the window.
It seemed like I had a sound sleep.
I couldn't recall a single dream.
It was seven o'clock.
Time for school.

[Sakuraba]
"Heyo."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed Sakuraba a mask.

[Sakuraba]
"Okay."

He put it on without a single question.

[Sakuraba]
"I'm hungry."

[Taichi]
"Have you not eaten?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm prepping for first period."

[Taichi]
"Eating curry rolls is what you call a class?"

[Sakuraba]
"It sure is...until all the curry rolls are gone."

He responded coolly.
Just like in the journal.

[Taichi]
"Just eat some ready-made curry."

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."

The records also suggested that.
Events steadily continued to match the journals.

[Sakuraba]
"Hexshoo!"

[Taichi]
"Ugh. Here we go again. A hexagonal tragedy..."

That was in the records.
The frequency of similarities occurring
was now over 15\p.
I calculated that one out of seven times, a snot
bridge event would occur.
So as an enlightened soul (me), I ended up providing
him with a mask to negate the situation.

[Sakuraba]
"Can I take off the mask now...?"

[Taichi]
"I can't allow that."

[Sakuraba]
"Life...sure is rough."

[Taichi]
"Took the words right out of my mouth."
"Alright, I'm heading home."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay..."

[Taichi]
"Meet at my house on Sunday morning."

[Sakuraba]
"Got it. I'm as good as there."

I wonder...
Wednesday.
At school.
A gate to prevent escape.
Instead of protecting the students, it was more like
keeping us away from the outside world.
That was the impression it gave me.

[Taichi]
"Here again?"

[Sakuraba]
"I've grown tired of it..."

[Taichi]
"Right?"
"I know you're tired, but I'll say this anyway..."
"You better not go off on a journey."

[Sakuraba]
"Got it."

[Taichi]
"Get my permission first."

[Sakuraba]
"Got it."

[Taichi]
"Your promises sound empty!"

[Sakuraba]
"Don't worry. I just need your permission, right?"

[Taichi]
"I guess you get it."

[Sakuraba]
"Do adventures count?"

[Taichi]
"All of it counts!"

[Sakuraba]
"All of it? So expeditions, too, huh..."

[Taichi]
"Anything that involves leaving town."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay, fine."

I hope he understands.

[Sakuraba]
"But hey, I've got a question."

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

[Sakuraba]
"The word, 'tease.'"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Sakuraba]
"Doesn't it get you excited?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi!"
"Hey! Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"What do you want?"

[Sakuraba]
"I want to go on a journey!"

[Taichi]
"..."

A chop to the back of the neck.
He collapsed.

[Sakuraba]
"Oooh. Go on a journey..."

[Taichi]
"Are you still saying such thing?"
"No journeys allowed."

[Sakuraba]
"That sucks..."

[Taichi]
"Not until next week."

[Sakuraba]
"So next week is okay?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Next week is fine. Just wait a few more days."

[Sakuraba]
"I see. All right then."

[Taichi]
"That really came out of nowhere."

[Sakuraba]
"Listen."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Sakuraba]
"I got tired of curry rolls."

[Taichi]
"You know what...?"

[Sakuraba]
"It just doesn't do it for me anymore. I want to
find something more interesting."

[Taichi]
"I get the feeling that fairy blood runs through
your veins."

[Sakuraba]
"Who knows? Maybe I'll find people."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

He had been thinking.

[Sakuraba]
"Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I owe you money."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you do, don't you?"

[Sakuraba]
"How much was it?"

There was no point in this.
What a weirdo.

[Taichi]
"Hm, I don't remember."

[Sakuraba]
"I'll just give you all of my change."

He took out his wallet.

[Taichi]
"Uhh."

[Sakuraba]
"This should make up for whatever is missing."

He took out a wooden box.

[Taichi]
"Uh...no, you can take that home."

[Sakuraba]
"You sure? I bet it's worth something."

[Taichi]
"Don't sell it. It belongs in a museum."

[Sakuraba]
"...?"
"So about my trip next week."

[Taichi]
"What about it?"

[Sakuraba]
"You want to go with me?"

[Taichi]
"Travel with you...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Well?"

[Taichi]
"Sounds fun..."

Next week.

[Taichi]
"Okay. Let's do it."

[Sakuraba]
"Cool! We'll be like falcons!"

[Taichi]
"Go ahead and be whatever you want to be."

[Sakuraba]
"All right then. I'm off for my journey."

[Taichi]
"Wait a sec!"
"I told you to stay until Sunday!"

[Sakuraba]
"Oh, sorry. I completely forgot."

It was too risky.

[Taichi]
"You're under arrest, Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"An arrest without a warrant."

[Sakuraba]
"Seriously?!"

[Taichi]
"Yep. So live here until Sunday."

[Sakuraba]
"Ugh."

[Taichi]
"I'm also gonna nickname you Sorrowful Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"Really? That's got a nice ring to it!
It's settled then!"

I felt sorrow for him.
I gave him a hug.
And then it was morning.
I opened my eyes.

[Taichi]
"..."
"Time to go, Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"No breakfast...?"

[Taichi]
"Eat when we get there."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"Let's go."

[Sakuraba]
"Where are we going?"

[Taichi]
"On a picnic."

[Sakuraba]
"An extremely foul picnic, huh."

[Taichi]
"Hmm. I guess you could say that."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm going to travel next week."

[Taichi]
"Be my guest."

Good.
I took him to the place.

[Taichi]
"Hold this."

[Sakuraba]
"What's this? A radio?"

[Taichi]
"I thought it'd serve as a point of reference."
"...Now start walking straight."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"Slowly."

[Sakuraba]
"How about here?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's fine. Go straight... Okay, stop."

Target locked on.
Only several minutes left.
That was a close call.

[Sakuraba]
"Hey, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Sakuraba]
"Why are you doing this?"

[Taichi]
"..."
"Why? No reason in particular really."

[Sakuraba]
"I think you have your reasons..."
"I can see it in your eyes."

[Taichi]
"You can...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Well we're close friends, aren't we?"

[Taichi]
"Close frie--...?!"

Are you kidding me?!
I was speechless.
We're in the 21st century, you know?

[Sakuraba]
"Are not able to hang out anymore?"

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba... You..."

[Sakuraba]
"So sad."
"If you hate me, you hate me, I guess."

[Taichi]
"No, Sakuraba. It's not like that."

[Sakuraba]
"Strange things keep happening lately."
"Everyone is gone for one..."

The sky darkened.

[Sakuraba]
"And evening comes so suddenly..."

There was no time.
He had to go.
But.
I'd never see his stupid face again.
It was just that.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba..."

[Sakuraba]
"What shocks me the most is that you're on the edge
and I'm not able to help you."

[Taichi]
"Moron."
"Focus on yourself. You've got a lot of work to do,
before you worry about others. You being serious, it
doesn't fit you."

[Sakuraba]
"That's how you used to be..."

[Taichi]
"?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Lately, you really seemed to be overdoing it."
"Brings back the old times..."

[Taichi]
"...!"

The old me.
He made me remember what it was like.

[Taichi]
"Get out of here, moron..."

*blink*
I "observed" it.
I closed my eyes...and opened them.

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi...?"
"Huh...a broadcast...?"
"Taichi? The radio..."
"..."
"I see..."
"Huh..."

The "lag" known as Sakuraba went home.

[Taichi]
"Man."

Close friends?
People still said stuff like that?
People like that really existed?

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

Hilarious.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah. Hahahah..."

I couldn't stop laughing.
However.
No matter how much I laughed...
My vision didn't blur.
That's why, Sakuraba...
This was a good thing.
I'd never see him again.
My memories were all that would remain of him.

[Taichi]
"Idiot..."

I got a little scared and I held my shaking legs.
I put my head down and closed my eyes.
Red snuck in through my eyelids.
And so the world turned...
