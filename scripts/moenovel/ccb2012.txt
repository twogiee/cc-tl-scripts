[Touko]
"Oh, Taichi...glad you're back..."

I came back.

[Taichi]
"I was just in the bathroom."

[Touko]
"Ok."

[Taichi]
"Well, anyways..."

[Touko]
"What...?"

I smiled softly.
I held her close.

[Touko]
"Eek! W-what are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"You have to get stronger, Touko."

[Touko]
"What do you mean?"

[Taichi]
"We can be together now, but it won't last forever."

[Touko]
"Wha? You mean..."
"Again?"

Her voice shook.

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

My guilt started to bother me.

[Taichi]
"L-look! People in my family don't live long!"

[Touko]
"But...but then...you'll abandon me again..."

[Taichi]
"No! Look! It's just that I'm a little sick! I mean,
I want you to look after my things if I die!"

I was weak.

[Touko]
"I want to be...with you...forever..."

[Taichi]
"I'll be here! For good!"

I kissed her, all over her face.
Forehead, cheeks, lips.
Like I was pecking her.
I sucked the tears that kept appearing at the
corners of her eyes.
The taste of salt...

[Touko]
"If...you're going to...hold me tighter..."

[Taichi]
"Okay, okay."

[Touko]
"Forever..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

As I was told, I squeezed her in my arms.
I knew this way wasn't good, but I had no choice.
To be honest though.
The way Touko was now, was pretty attractive.
Yeah, this much is just right...

[Taichi]
"You want to go to the seaside tomorrow?"

[Touko]
"The sheside?"

She said it with a lisp.

[Taichi]
"Invite some friends, like old times."

[Touko]
"Yeah, we did go last year."
"It was fun."

[Taichi]
"You were always so angry."

[Touko]
"That's because of all of your sex talk."
"But..."
"Even though I didn't like the sexual harassment, I
was happy that you were with me."

[Taichi]
"..."
"Damn..."

*Squeeze*

[Touko]
"Eek?"

[Taichi]
"Damn it Touko, you're so cute"

[Touko]
"W-what... Is that something bad?"

[Taichi]
"Love is war, and the one who falls in love loses."

[Touko]
"Then you've got nothing to worry about."

She nuzzled her nose into my chest.

[Touko]
"...Because I'm fine with losing."

She shouldn't say stuff that turned me on!
WOW!

[Touko]
"Huh?"
"What the... WHAT?"

She was rubbing it with her waist.
Ah...that just gets me more and more turned on.

[Touko]
"Taichi! Wh-what are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"I...can't stop..."

[Touko]
"What the...you've completely..."

[Taichi]
"I told you I can't stop."

There was no way I could hold back.

[Taichi]
"I can't stop, Touko."

[Touko]
"It was just starting to get romantic!"

[Taichi]
"Forgive me."

[Touko]
"Stupid...pervert...idiot!"

[Taichi]
"Say whatever you want."

[Touko]
"I can't believe that when I was being happy or sad,
you were thinking about THIS!"
"You're horrible!"

[Taichi]
"Think? I wasn't thinking..."

[Touko]
"Why is THAT THING like that then?"

[Taichi]
"It's the sad nature of a man... A thought from his
nether regions that neither wind nor rain can
quench."

[Touko]
"It means that you're perverted!?"

[Taichi]
"Objection! It's because girls have such a good
scent!"

[Touko]
"A scent...?"

She was dumbfounded.

[Taichi]
"Touko, your bittersweet smell...that's what turned me
on."

[Touko]
"Let...let go of me!"

She shoved me in the face until my upper body turned
from her.

[Taichi]
"Aghph!"

[Touko]
"Let! Go! Of! ME!"

The mouth that just said hold me, was now telling me
to let her go!
It was enough to make a chill guy like me...
Really ANGRY!
My arms around her, was squeezed even tighter.
I pressed my whole body against her.

[Touko]
"NO!"

[Taichi]
"This isn't the first time for you!"

[Touko]
"No! Stop it!"

[Taichi]
"Girl, time for you to give up!"

[Touko]
"I don't want to!"

[Taichi]
"You like this, don't you?"

[Touko]
"I REFUSE!"

Touko's hand, pushed against my face.
Our lower halves were stuck together, making us look
like the letter "Y".
The Japanese symbol for "person" has the meaning of
supporting one another, but when turned upside-down
into the letter "Y", it shows a quarrel.
An hour of struggle passed.

[Taichi]
*pant pant*

[Touko]
*pant pant*

Our lengthy battle came to a standstill.
She was as tired as I was.
She was still pushing away at my face though it
wasn't enough to stop me kissing her.

[Taichi]
"You're acting like I am assaulting you."

[Touko]
"You kinda are though..."

[Taichi]
"Just let me play doctor."

[Touko]
"I will sue you for malpractice."

We were so tired, there was no way to sugar-coat our
words.

[Taichi]
"This is love!"

[Touko]
"Your face just shows lust!"

[Taichi]
"Don't deny the lust. It's natural."

[Touko]
"It's just because you let that wave of lust take
you over!"

Damn, we weren't getting anywhere.

[Taichi]
"Okay, let's try this then."
"I will give one up. So you give one up too."

[Touko]
"...What do you want me to give up?"

I took it to the negotiation table.
We must have been feeling really tired.
Either way, it was stupid of us to get into a fight
in the first place when all humanity was gone.

[Taichi]
"Anyways, just satisfy me. Any way is fine."

[Touko]
"Are. You. Stupid?!"

She dug her fingernails into my face.

[Taichi]
"Owww! Stop it!"

My fingernails dug into her butt.

[Touko]
*shriek*

[Taichi]
"Are you trying to get us to kill each other?"

[Touko]
"Ugh...you're the one doing that!"

[Taichi]
"It's a negotiation! Any method. It's all up to you.
Just satisfy me anyway you like! So choose!"

[Touko]
"Ugh..."

Tears welled up.

[Touko]
"Wahhh...why does it have to be like that?
Graceless, too realistic, not romantic at all!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah! That's the difference between guys and girls!
We don't listen, but we can read maps!"

[Touko]
"What do you want me to do then...?"

She looked like she was about to cry.
I whispered some of the things I wanted her to do.

[Touko]
"I'd rather die!"

She started resisting strongly.

[Touko]
"No...! Help, Grandfather!"

[Taichi]
"Your grandfather made you by doing the same thing
you know!"

[Touko]
"Not like that, though!"

[Taichi]
"Did you know that your grandfather was into the
abnormal stuff?"

[Touko]
"Stop lying to me!"

Her nails again! Those nails!
I was lying though.

[Taichi]
"Okay, I got it."
"We're getting nowhere. I'll tell make the request."

[Touko]
"Whaaa?"

She couldn't hide her mistrust.

[Taichi]
"Maybe we could have the scene fade out and do it
off screen."

[Touko]
"What does that mean?"

[Taichi]
"I can't even kiss you..."

Her arms weakened.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Touko was linked to me, and looked up with glossy
eyes.

[Touko]
"...Kiss?"

[Taichi]
"Your perspective of moods change pragmatically..."

[Touko]
"Kiss me...kiss me..."

She seemed into it now.

[Taichi]
"Touko, there is a lot of things that you can do
with your mouth, you know."

[Touko]
"...I only want to use it for talking and kissing..."

Hmph.

[Taichi]
"So, you're not going to use it for munching on food?"

[Touko]
"I hate nitpicker Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...Anyways, let's kiss already"

We weren't getting anywhere.

[Touko]
"I don't want to do it like that!"

Hmph...

[Taichi]
"Hey, you know..."

[Touko]
"You wouldn't understand..."

[Taichi]
"I don't know what you mean."

[Touko]
"Be more dramatic."

[Taichi]
"I never watched any TV dramas!"

[Touko]
"Ugh..."

[Taichi]
"A battle girl like you needs to be prepared."

Battle girl...
Taichi Keyword: 
A type of middle school girl. 
It is a girl who acts like she's tough.
Only one on this earth. But, even before everyone
disappeared there still was only one.
This just taught us a lesson, that it wasn't good to
just break down and categorize everything.

[Taichi]
"Okay, then, what should we do? Are you going to
stay selfish?"

[Touko]
"..."

Hesitation.
Worry.
Agony.
And...

[Touko]
"Okay, then..."

She said with tears in her eyes.

[Touko]
"Okay then...I'll do it."

[Taichi]
"Yay!"

A lot of time and effort for one kiss.
That's Touko for you.
I felt bad for her so, I decided to be serious about
it.
A battle girl's shame...a shameful battle girl.

[Taichi]
"Close your eyes."

[Touko]
"Mph..."

Her thin lips trembled.
This was lovable in a sense, but I still wasn't
satisfied.
I put more of my weight onto her.
