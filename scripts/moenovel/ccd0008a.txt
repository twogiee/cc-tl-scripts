Tomoki was reapplying the camouflage facing the
hallway on the window.

[Taichi]
"Heeey!"

[Tomoki]
"Oh, Taichi..."

Seemingly embarrassed, Tomoki stepped away from
the window.
Club rooms typically had windows installed on its
walls facing the hallway.
That made it possible to observe from outside.
The reason should be easy to guess.

[Taichi]
"Why bother fixing it...?"

[Tomoki]
"It's just something I noticed that was bugging me.
No other real reason."

Was he sure about that?
Sure, substantially.
But deep in his heart?

[Tomoki]
"There really is no one around, eh?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, seems like there really is just the eight
of us left."

[Tomoki]
"Who knows what's what anymore..."

I remember Tomoki bore resentment toward Mimi.
Even though they were blood-related.
Their different last names were because of
circumstances.
Circumstances at home.

[Taichi]
"Hey, were you being serious about last night?"

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"That you were gonna handle our food problem?"

[Tomoki]
"Oh yeah, I'll start from this afternoon. I just
came to check the school real quick."

[Taichi]
"Food, huh."

It wasn't really a necessity.
The world was going to roll back in a week anyway.
Even if we die, we'd just come back.

[Taichi]
"..."

Restless thoughts began to fill my head.
No good...
Better to remain calm.

[Taichi]
"Friendship is..."

[Tomoki]
"Not asking anything in return."

*thumbs-up*
We gave each other a thumbs-up.

[Tomoki]
"That's why I made an abrupt decision."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Tomoki..."

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"You're fighting with Mimi, aren't you?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"Even in times like these, you two are still at it?"

[Tomoki]
"Whatever..."

His mood darkened as he spoke.

[Tomoki]
"I don't really care about her anymore."

His words were obstinate.

[Taichi]
"These kinds of fights always end with something
broken in the comics..."

Tomoki's expression turned frighteningly grim.
