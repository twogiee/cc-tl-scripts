I came back to my room and turned on the light.
So much had been going on, and I was spent.

[Taichi]
"Ugh, it's hot!"

The air conditioner had better get fixed soon.
The AC on the first floor worked, but that didn't
help me in my room.

[Taichi]
"Maybe a cold bath will help."

And so, I was soaking in the bath, when-

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... Huh?"

Just as the amazing feeling of the cold bath began
to send me to the other side of consciousness, the
doorbell called me back.

[Taichi]
"Crap!"

I jumped out of the bath and wiped myself down as
fast as I could.
I threw on my kimono and rushed to the entryway.

[Taichi]
"Coming!"
"Who is it?"

[Yusa]
"Er, um, it's Doujima."

[Taichi]
"Such a wicked-sounding name attached to such a cute
voice... Is that you, Yusa? It's open, come in!"

The door timidly swung open, to reveal a beautiful
young girl.

[Yusa]
"G-good evening."

Her eyes were open wide.
I could see myself reflected in her pitch-black
pupils.

[Taichi]
"Good evening."

[Yusa]
"You're wearing a kimono."

[Taichi]
"Oh, this? Did it shock you?"

[Yusa]
"It was surprising, yes..."

[Taichi]
"I'm a fan of Natsume Soseki."

[Yusa]
"Okay..."

[Taichi]
"That's why I like to wear this."

[Yusa]
"It, um, it looks good on you."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Yusa]
"Well, because of your white hair, the...
the colors match well..."

[Taichi]
"Even so, kimono look better with black hair."

I gave a bitter smile.

[Taichi]
"And it'd probably look better on you, Yusa."

[Yusa]
"Th-that..." *hiccup*

A hiccup cut off her exclamation.

[Yusa]
*hiccup*...*hiccup*...*hiccup*

[Taichi]
"Oh, dear..."

[Yusa]
*hiccup* "...Excuse me..." *hiccup*

[Taichi]
"It doesn't seem like they'll stop anytime soon."

I'll have to give her a fright...
If she were Kirihara, I wouldn't have thought twice
about just flashing her.
But to surprise Yusa...

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."
"Yusa, look here."

[Yusa]
"Hm?" *hiccup*

As she raised her beautiful face, I brought mine
closer.
From a couple inches away, I whispered to her.

[Taichi]
"Let's get married."

[Yusa]
"?!"

Yusa froze in place.
For what must have been a minute, she stood there
without moving an inch.
The hiccups had stopped.

[Yusa]
"Uh, um, what...?"

[Taichi]
"Hey, why don't you come in?"

[Yusa]
"Um, what just...?"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry, come on."

[Yusa]
"What happened just now...?"

I gave her a seat and poured her some barley tea.

[Yusa]
"Where's your family?"

[Taichi]
"I'm not sure, I wonder if they'll come home
tonight..."

[Yusa]
"What?"

A perplexed look came over her face.
She must've been imagining some complicated
situation.
Well, truth be told, it was pretty complicated.

[Taichi]
"It's a busy time of year for their work, so they stay
in the company dorms more often than not."

[Yusa]
"Is that so..."

[Taichi]
"So what exciting news has brought you to my place
today?"

[Yusa]
"You sound a bit like a character in some foreign
novel when you say that."
"Um, so today is my birthday."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, really?"

I had no idea.
Yeah... I was thoughtless.

[Yusa]
"So here...a birthday present for you."

My head was filled with nothing but questions, but I
unconsciously took the wrapped package from her.

[Taichi]
"Ummm...well, thanks. But, uh...?"

Why was she giving ME a birthday present?

[Yusa]
"For all you've done for me."

I'd certainly been looking out her quite a bit.
Or, I guess I'd been making her fall in love with
me. Or experimenting with how to get her to, anyway.
I'd been maintaining a close relationship with her
for a long time. I'd always thought it might negate
my own physical flaws.
Even the great literary romantics would approve of
this experiment, and it was still even providing
some useful data.
I just realized that I hadn't thought about what to
do if the experiment succeeded.

[Yusa]
"Also, if you happened to finish going over my
school journal..."

Her fingers fidgeted eagerly on her lap.
Her head was hanging shyly, but I could still see
her blush on the nape of her neck.
She was practically ready to burst.

[Taichi]
"Adorable."

[Yusa]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, I said 'Already done.' I'll go get it."

[Yusa]
"Oh, okay."

I went upstairs to my room.
Okay, her diary and... I needed to find something...
I looked over the room.
Looked for something to give her.
Even something as simple as a teddy bear would do,
but my room was no such fairytale place.
Far from a fairytale.
Function over form.

[Taichi]
"No good, no good..."

I tried thinking of what I would want in this
situation.
Yusa's unwashed panties.
My hand immediately removed the sash from my
kimono, I steeled my resolve, and I tore my
underwear off.
"I've taken special care to save this pair just for
you..."

[Taichi]
"No good."

It should be more birthday-appropriate. Surely I
must have something...

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

Hmmm, how about this?
It seemed pretty out-of-character...
It could be trouble if I gave her something that
awakened her kinky side...

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

I needed to find something that'd surprise her.
Maybe this'll do the trick?

[Taichi]
"Hmmmmmm..."

I heard her voice from downstairs...

[Yusa]
"Umm, Taichi, it's getting pretty late, so I have to
go home soon."

[Taichi]
"Ugh."

No time to delay.
I found the manual and the box, repackaged her gift,
and hurriedly thrust it into a paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Sorry to keep you waiting, Yusa."

[Yusa]
"Oh..."

I could see the relief on her face.

[Taichi]
"Well, here's your journal, and this is a birthday
gift from me."

[Yusa]
"..."

Yusa's the type that gets lost for words when
surprised.
The explanation for the gift could wait.

[Taichi]
"Well then, I better walk you home."

[Yusa]
"?!"

She got even more lost for words at that.

[Taichi]
"It's nighttime, there might be creepers lying
in wait."

Especially around these parts.

[Taichi]
"Shall we?"

[Yusa]
"O-okay."

We made our way down the moonlit street.
Yusa moved at a slow pace, and time seemed to slip
away as we walked together.

[Taichi]
"Oh hey, please be sure to give my thanks to your
mother for me."

[Yusa]
"My mother?"

[Taichi]
"For always stuffing me full whenever I visit."

[Yusa]
"Yeah, I suppose you're right..."

[Taichi]
"Have you gotten used to school?"

[Yusa]
"You're always asking me that question, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Huh, am I?"

Now that she mentioned it, I always did ask her
that.

[Taichi]
"It's just one of those things people say, to pad
out a conversation."
"But it seems like you've grown out of that kind of
childish talk, Yusa."

[Yusa]
"Y-you haven't known me long enough to know about
my childhood, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean? You'll be hearing this for many
years to come!"

[Yusa]
"Teehee, you say that all the time!"

[Taichi]
"I just mean you've grown so much since we met.
That's the way I see it, anyway."
"There's still some parts of you that are
undeveloped, though."

[Yusa]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Please take care of yourself. Physically, I mean."

Not that that was the kind of thing someone could do
even if they wanted.

[Yusa]
"Huh??"
"I kinda still don't get what you mean but...
all right."
"If it's what you want, I'll do my best, Taichi."

I clenched my hands at my sides.

[Taichi]
"Good, good."

[Yusa]
"Um, thanks for walking me home."

[Taichi]
"You need not thank me, m'lady, tis but only natural
for a gentleman such as myself."

I said, with an air of nobility.

[Yusa]
"How charmy!"

[Taichi]
"Heheheh."

I think she meant 'charming'.
She's too friggin' cute!

[Taichi]
"For a woman like you, I would love to charm the
pants right off of you where you sleep at night."

[Yusa]
"Where I sleep?"

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, I kid, I kid!"

[Yusa]
"You know, you walking me home like this? It feels
like a scene out of some novel."

[Taichi]
"Does it?"

Come to mention it, Yusa was a fan of novels
of the 'dragoste' variety.
Look up the word 'dragoste,' you'll see what I mean.

[Yusa]
"I'm a little surprised."

[Taichi]
"Like I said, it's only the natural thing to do."
"I mean, in this world, there are those who wouldn't
think twice about taking advantage of the weak."
"They are a pitiable lot."

There's goodness to be found among the greatest of
the great and the smallest of the small.
My philosophy has always been that, ultimately,
there's good in everything.

[Yusa]
"..."

Her face told me that she felt I was telling her
something that she wasn't yet mature enough to
understand.
It stimulated something in me.

[Taichi]
"That said, I don't want to be the kind of man
who only sets his sights on those out of reach."
(In other words...... I'm not only interested in
older women.)
"I want to be a man who is aware of both what's
beyond him and what's right under foot."
(In other words......I'd like to share my affection
with women younger and older.)
"From the perspective of a micro-ideologist, you
could say that such a man would be my ideal form."
"Say life is a surfboard. Cool, granted. But there's
more to life than form. What about function? These
are issues of life people face to some degree."
"People are afraid of repeating their experience of
failure and their childhood traumas..."
"So afraid that they spend their days wishing for
nothing more than to return to ignorance. It just
seems cowardly to me."

(In short, definitely pre-puberty.)

[Taichi]
"If we value things strictly from a physical
perspective, anything with that value can be
categorized."
"Some are bowl or rocket-shaped, some have bell-like
tips, or sag, or are just flat. Heck, some even have
concaved tips, I hear..."

When I finally looked at Yusa again, she'd been busy
taking notes.

[Taichi]
"Ack! Don't do that!"

[Yusa]
"Huh? What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"You shouldn't be recording this stuff!"

[Yusa]
"W-well, a lot of it didn't make sense, so I thought
I'd look it up later..."

What?!
Dang it! I couldn't have her actually looking up
all this filthy slang on the internet!

[Taichi]
"Watch out! Take cover!"

I quickly pulled her with me to hide behind a
telephone pole.

[Yusa]
"Whah?!"

[Taichi]
"Shhh! Keep quiet, we're on the battlefield."

[Yusa]
"A quiet street like this in the middle of peaceful
Japan is a battlefield?!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. I can practically feel a soldier's bloodlust
right now."

[Yusa]
"So you're a soldier?!"

I went on to tell her many examples of military
intelligence.
American-this, Russian-that, deep-state broadcasting,
military acronyms...

[Taichi]
"This is all extremely sensitive intel."

It may not have been all that sensitive.

[Yusa]
"Whoooaaa..."

[Taichi]
"Seems like they're gone. We should be all right."

We returned to the path.
As we continued our way to her home, we passed by a
businessman who gave us a dubious look.
He was probably returning home down this idyllic
path after some late-night hook-up.

[Taichi]
"I'm sorry, but everything I told you before was
confidential information. If you were to record it,
you'd be putting your innocent self in danger."

[Yusa]
"O-Oh my gosh."

[Taichi]
"I hate to ask this, but could you please destroy
all of your memos from tonight's conversation?"

[Yusa]
"A-all right, I'll erase them. I'm really sorry."

She used the eraser on her mechanical pencil and
wiped the page clean.
Ah, what a pristine eraser it was. It looked like it
hadn't been used before...

[Taichi]
"Sorry for the trouble."

[Yusa]
"Don't be, it was wrong of me."

My chest hurt with that one.
It was all my fault, after all.
