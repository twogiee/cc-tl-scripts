Club activities.
Miki jumped out from the shade.
My eyes were locked on her.
I squeezed the trigger of the uzi submachine gun in
my hand.
Bullets flew.
Bullets ricocheted around her.

[Miki]
"Huh?!"

Miki realized what was going on.
She jumped into cover behind the tree and returned
fire.
Damn it! She's got me pinned down!
Mimi appeared on my flank.
I removed the empty clip from my AK47.

[Misato]
"Sakura isn't here."

[Taichi]
"Did you lose track of her?!"

[Misato]
"She's quick..."

[Taichi]
"Ngh... This is trouble."

Never lose track of the enemy.
Just then, Kiri flew in from the right.
A pincer attack... Just what I need.
Kiri's M4A1 Carbine spewed fire.

[Misato]
"We've been had."

[Taichi]
"Shit!"

Two against one.
I pulled back while firing in Kiri's direction.
It would be over if they came from both sides.
I worried about where Miki had gone...
Just as a barrel was thrust into my back.

[Miki]
"Hands up!"

W-where did she come from?!

[Miki]
"Game over."

[Taichi]
"Ugh. Beaten again."

[Miki]
"Howdy, partner!"

[Kiri]
"We win!"

Miki and Kiri gave each other a high five.

[Taichi]
"That's four losses in a row. Ugh..."

Club activities like normal.
Well...not exactly.
