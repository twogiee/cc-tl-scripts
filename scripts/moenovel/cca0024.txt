I was writing another script.

[Taichi]
"Heheheh."
"Heheheheheh!"
"Heeeeheheheheh!!" (I was actually crying.)

It just wouldn't come together!
I was in a completely different head space from
when I first started. I was no longer captivated by
the brilliance of my own writing.

[Voice]
"-ke..."

Someone called out to me.
I peeked outside the window.

[Taichi]
"Mimi?"

[Misato]
"Good evening!"

[Taichi]
"What's up?"

[Misato]
"Where are you?"

[Taichi]
"I'm looking at you from the second floor window!"

[Misato]
"It's too dark, I can't see a thing!"

[Taichi]
"I can see you pretty well from here!"

[Misato]
"How so?"

[Taichi]
"Who can say?"

[Misato]
"Pekke, you must have excellent night vision!"

[Taichi]
"I'm a wild animal so I have sharp senses!"

[Misato]
"It sounds so cool!"

She waved her arms about as she talked.
It made her look quite childlike.

[Taichi]
"Hey, why don't you come up?"

[Misato]
"Okay!"
"Oh, it's a candle!"

[Taichi]
"Atmosphere means everything when it comes to
writing, madame."

[Misato]
"I see..."

She plopped herself down and sat on her knees.

[Misato]
"Were you studying just now?"

[Taichi]
"No, writing another script."

[Misato]
"Oh."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, what brings you here today?"

[Misato]
"Oh, I thought I should treat you to a meal
since you're always helping me out."

She handed me a package.

[Misato]
"I brought you some food."

[Taichi]
"Three cheers for Misato!"

[Misato]
"I made enough for two, why don't we eat it
together?"

[Taichi]
"Sounds good, I'll grab some drinks."
"It's delicious!"
"I didn't know you were a great cook too, Misato."

[Misato]
"You think so? I only just picked up cooking
recently..."

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm not exactly a gourmet chef, either."

[Misato]
"Ah, it sounds a little mean the way you say it..."

[Taichi]
"Mmm, it's delicious! It's really really good!"
"You cooked it so well. Did you flame grill it?"

[Misato]
"Yes. Of course"

[Taichi]
"It feels like a long time since I've eaten dinner
like this..."

[Misato]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"Well... I don't have a mom, y'know."

[Misato]
"Oh, right..."

[Taichi]
"I think I'm missing a mom in my life."

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"Misato..."

We stared at one another in the dim light.
The delicate flame of the candlelight illuminated
her features in pale scarlet.
