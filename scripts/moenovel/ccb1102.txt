[Taichi]
"Alrighty..."

It was still before noon so it was still fairly cool.
I went to the rooftop by myself.
It was still morning.
Misato would be coming sometime in the afternoon.

[Taichi]
"Well then..."

I decided to get right into it.
It was time for some heavy lifting.
Even someone like me could move the heavy stuff.
...
...
...
I carried the equipment to the rooftop.
I came across Tomoki.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi...?"

He looked startled.

[Taichi]
"Are you here to take part in the club?"

[Tomoki]
"No way."

[Taichi]
"Misato seems worried about you."

[Tomoki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"She seems pretty stressed out."
"It has to do with stuff happening at home, right?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And I think that's why she's been a bit rash
recently. "

[Tomoki]
"I don't know if I'd say she's being rash..."

[Taichi]
"Maybe it's just her way of dealing with it?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

His expression looked grave.

[Taichi]
"Well I guess I shouldn't be meddling in it, but
honestly, she's struggling without your help."

[Tomoki]
"Anyway, why are you helping her?"

[Taichi]
"Well I don't have anything else to do."
"And I think these kinds of things are important to
us."

I put the equipment down on the long table.
It still needed to be wired up.

[Taichi]
"Damn, I don't know how to do this part."

[Tomoki]
"What are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Well, if I get this antenna going, she'll be like,
'Pekke you're so cool, I'm amazed, you're going
to make me wet!' Then kiss me for sure."

[Tomoki]
"No way would she smooch you."
"Is it for the club?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

Tomoki sluggishly sat down on the ground.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, thanks."

Canned juice.
It wasn't even cold.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi, what makes you so full of life?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, such a naive question to ask."

[Tomoki]
"I don't understand."

[Taichi]
"Of course you wouldn't."

[Tomoki]
"Why do you bother with club activities, anyway?"

[Taichi]
"Can I say something else?"

I put on a serious face.

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"It's to do with you and your...sister.
Is that okay?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It's a serious question."

[Tomoki]
"Okay... What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Sure."

Cautiously, I pressed forward with the question.

[Taichi]
"Why do you use Kansai dialect sometimes
even though you're from Kanto?"

[Tomoki]
"That's got nothing to do with my sister at all!!"
"I'm going home..."

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, wait up. Rome wasn't built in a day."

[Tomoki]
"Thanks for nothing, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Don't get too cynical about it."
"It's just that it would be better to have a purpose
for living, right?"

[Tomoki]
"Purpose for living...?"
"Maybe none of that matters if you have food
to survive."

[Taichi]
"You know... I always wonder about it..."

[Tomoki]
"About what?"

[Taichi]
"Kids that go around in groups putting up
graffiti..."
"I wonder what it feels like?"

[Tomoki]
"Well, hard to say I guess..."

Tomoki stood up and circled the antenna.

[Tomoki]
"So this is it, huh?"

[Taichi]
"It's cool that you know about these things."

[Tomoki]
"So what. There's plenty of other things you can do,
too."

[Taichi]
"At the very least, this club has hope."

[Tomoki]
"It might be that we can only confirm hope?"

[Taichi]
"There's hope in confirming hope."

[Tomoki]
"I don't understand your thought processes, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Tomoki]
"Why do you always look like you're having so much
fun?"

[Taichi]
"Heheh."

[Tomoki]
"Really, I can't say I understand you."

Tomoki wiped his eyes with his arm.

[Tomoki]
"But what I understand is...how to connect this
antenna with the mobile equipment."

[Taichi]
"Can you do it for me then?"

[Tomoki]
"Hey, you could have at least shown some sort of
reaction to what I said."

[Taichi]
"Idiot. I'm crying inside, right from the bottom of
my heart. Weeping. I'm crying tears of inspiration."

[Tomoki]
"You don't look it."

[Taichi]
"It's awkward getting caught up in emotions between
just us boys. Save those kinds of events for your
sister."

[Tomoki]
"You jerk!"

[Taichi]
"All right, let's get moving! We're going live from
tomorrow."

[Tomoki]
"All right, all right."
"I'll go work on it."
"...And Taichi?"

Tomoki stopped while walking back to the school
building.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Tomoki]
"I thought for sure you were going to tell me
to make up with my sister. Tell me to help her out
or something since I am her brother after all."

[Taichi]
"Nah, arguments between siblings are natural in life.
It won't end."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"In short, just help me out here."

I puffed my chest out in pride.

[Tomoki]
"Big shot."

[Taichi]
"Guess I'm an outlier cause I got over 80

[Tomoki]
"Hey, we're friends, outlier or not."
"It's not like it makes a difference to me."

He disappeared inside the school building. Almost as
if he ran away.

[Taichi]
"Makes no difference... HA!"

After saying that, Tomoki had blushed redder than
ever.

[Taichi]
"You didn't have to say it if it was going
to make you feel that embarrassed."

I looked up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"But I guess I've gotten somewhere."

Now the fun would really begin.
We were going to make good memories.
So that one day, we could enjoy having a dream...
For sure.
Forever.
To be thankful someday.
I would fight for it.
