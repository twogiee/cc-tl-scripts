I poked my head into the classroom to find that
Touko was there.
I was a bit surprised, so I decided to hang around.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara."

Her sorrowful look seemed to pierce right through
me, with her glazed, sunken eyes.
Her cheeks looked hollow from sickness.
She was pale.
Her hair was frayed.
Her life-force seemed to be dimming out.
She just sat there emotionless, staring at the desk.
As no one touched her, she seemed to be decaying.
In a world where humans disappeared.
She couldn't take the shock of it all.
Maybe she just wanted to die alone.
But in order to die, first she had to live.
I got closer, and called to her.
I tried as hard as I could to be kind.
Even though it was fake...I didn't care.
Because I had to do it, even if it was fake.

[Taichi]
"I know it's not really your thing, but why don't
you try coming to club tomorrow?"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

With a puzzled and confused expression,
she lifted her head up.
Her faded expression became infused with a scarlet
red, conveying a somewhat dejected impression.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

I put a bottle and wrapped sandwich down on the
table.
It was left over from the beach day.
There was enough for one person.
She seemed to look right through it.

[Taichi]
"Take it slow, okay? Else you might get sick."

[Touko]
"I have no appetite."

Her voice was hoarse.

[Taichi]
"Okay, just try eating."

[Touko]
"..."

She reached out slowly.
She unwrapped the sandwich.
She took a small bite.

[Taichi]
"Slowly, okay? I have water."

[Touko]
"Uhh."

She put her hand to her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Are you okay?"

[Touko]
"I'm okay...just go."

She waved me away.
She looked weak, but she was telling me to go.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara."

The air was gloomy.

[Touko]
"I'll take this."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Touko]
"I'll eat it at home."

[Taichi]
"You...will?"

[Touko]
"Yeah."
"Thanks."

She quickly thanked me.

[Taichi]
"I...was thinking of going to club this Sunday."
"Come if you can, okay?"
"We're going to transmit an SOS."
"Although it seems like we don't have enough range."
"No matter how much we adjust the direction and
bandwidth."
"Anyway, that's what we do now."
"Not bad, right?"

[Touko]
"Yeah..."

It seemed that our trainwreck of a relationship had
improved, just a tiny bit.
