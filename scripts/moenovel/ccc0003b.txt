Monday...
7 am.
Time to get up.
But!
You didn't have to get up little one...
I heard a kind grandmotherly voice.
I responded to her in my head.
Really? Why?
So I can eat you!!
You're not an old hag. You're a wolf.
With that, I just slept.

[Taichi]
"Heheheh."

I was happy.
Mankind probably had been destroyed, but at that
very moment, my happiness was close to that of a
god.

[Youko]
"Taichi..."
"Taichi. Wake up."

[Taichi]
"Uhhhh."

[Youko]
"If you don't wake up I might do something naughty."

[Taichi]
"Uggg..."

[Youko]
"Okay..."

*flump*
*rustling*

[Taichi]
"Ahhh!!"

I jumped awake.

[Taichi]
"Eughhh."

I felt some kind of stimulation.
A groaning.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Someone was inside my futon!

[Taichi]
"Who is it!"

I tried kicking them.
*grab*
My heel, trained well from Karade (strong attack
downwards) was easily caught.

[Taichi]
"?!"

While it escaped the impact, it twisted away.
Trying to stop my movement?

[Taichi]
"Ah!!"

I preemptively twisted my body and at the same time,
I kicked with my other foot.
My heel completely missed.

[Youko]
"Phew..."

[Taichi]
"Whaat?!"

She blew into my ears, making me bend back like a
prawn.

[Taichi]
"S-stop it!"

I struggled and rolled off the bed.
I hit my head.

[Taichi]
"Ouch."

I was shocked, and felt like I lost something
important inside of me.

[Youko]
"Morning."

[Taichi]
"What are you playing at!!"

[Youko]
"So that you can wake up feeling good..."

[Taichi]
"Don't wake me up like that ever again!"

[Youko]
"..."

She looked discontent.

[Taichi]
"Nearly everyone's gone anyway, so it's fine if I
just don't wake up right?"

[Youko]
"Just in case."

[Taichi]
"I just got up and I'm already tired..."

[Youko]
"Lunch..."

She showed me the package.

[Taichi]
"You came to deliver lunch, but instead you did
dirty stuff and tried to fight?"

[Youko]
"It's for two, anyhow."

[Taichi]
"Listen to me!"
"Wait up, don't worry. Explaining common sense to
someone without any is useless anyway."

[Youko]
"Just reporting."

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

I decided to get changed.
I took my clothes off.
It wasn't embarrassing for her to see me like this
anyway.
Actually, I didn't care.
As I was taking off my pajamas, my underwear started
to go down...as well.

[Taichi]
"..."

I turned around and saw Youko pulling them down with
both hands.

[Taichi]
"Don't come any closer to me!!"

I ran away to the corner of the room and screeched
at her.

[Taichi]
"Why did you pull my underwear down..."

[Youko]
"..."

She feigned ignorance.

[Taichi]
"Is this your way of getting back at me for always
playing jokes on you?"

[Youko]
"No."

[Taichi]
"Then why would you do such a thing?"

[Youko]
"Because I like you."

[Taichi]
"Lieees!!"

I denied what she said, while posing like a naked
full grown man, drawn on the plate of a satellite,
showing mankind and the history of man.

[Taichi]
"You tried to do something weird!"

[Youko]
"No."

[Taichi]
"Come on, you leopardess... Admit your sins."
"I give up."

I decided to change my underwear.

[Taichi]
"Uhh..."

I looked for a new pair of underwear.

[Youko]
"Here, it's already out."

[Taichi]
"Mm."

Accepted.
I paid little attention and wore it.

[Taichi]
"Huh..?"

The underwear was made of metal.
I heard a locking sound from behind.
I turned back and saw Youko doing something
while crouching.

[Taichi]
"What are you doing..."

[Youko]
"I locked it..."

[Taichi]
"..."
"Why?"

[Youko]
"It'll come off if I don't lock it."

[Taichi]
"But why is there a lock on the underwear?!"

[Youko]
"It's a chastity belt."

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

Chastity belt?

[Taichi]
"Wha, so I can't get out of it?!"

[Youko]
"Without a key you can't."

[Taichi]
"Key!"

I struck at her.

[Youko]
*gulp*

She put it on her tongue and swallowed it.

[Taichi]
"Whaaa?!"
"What, why?!"

[Youko]
"You were naughty last week."
"You can't do stuff like that."

[Taichi]
"I didn't get up to anything unusual at all last
week!"

[Youko]
"Not that last week."
"Anyway, it's a deed that I can't overlook."

[Taichi]
"I don't get you... Swallowing the key and all..."

[Youko]
"You can't take it off anymore."

[Taichi]
"You bitch. Do you want an enema?"

[Youko]
"That's fine with me but I think it'd be useless
anyway. You're more than welcome to go ahead and
try."

She beat me.
This girl could probably spew it out all on her own.
Like a grandpa who can swallow
a live goldfish whole and spew it out.
I fell for it.
I fell for it hard.
I fell for it for her.

[Youko]
"Calm down my Taichi. I have a reason for putting
this chastity belt on you."

[Taichi]
"There's a reason why you must put a chastity belt
on a fellow comrade who's been through thick and
thin with you?"

[Youko]
"...I did a bit of research this morning."

This succubus spoke as if nothing had happened.

[Youko]
"I couldn't go to the power plant anymore."

[Taichi]
"The reason for the chastity belt?"

[Youko]
"With that, and the information of the shrine, I
made sense of it all."

[Taichi]
"What has that got to do with the chastity belt?!"

Youko searched through her luggage.
What was she doing?

[Youko]
"Here, Taichi."

She passed me a bunch of new notebooks.

[Taichi]
"...The information I just told you and these items
are not having a connection to each other."

There was a limit to how little information you can
give.

[Youko]
"And...a lot of things are weird. So I want to
research it a little more properly."
"The chastity belt is to keep you from causing
trouble, for those times I can't keep my eyes on
you."

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

Disappointed.
That was it.

[Youko]
"I'll be back by lunch."

So that's why the lunch was for two.
It's been a while since I've seen Youko so active.
I wondered if something happened.
I didn't do anything in particular to incite her
either.
She pressed her lips against my cheek and left.
