I went to the community where Miki lived.
Miki was jogging at the bottom of the hill.
She spotted me.
She started running.
And was heading my way...
While stumbling like crazy.

[Miki]
"Waaaaah!!"

She was crying.
She flew right into me.
I held her for a moment.

[Miki]
"Taichi, Taichi, Taaiiiiichiiii!"
"Everybody is gone! It's so weird...this is really
strange!!"

[Taichi]
"Y, yeah..."

[Miki]
"There's no one in the houses... Everybody is gone!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

I patted her back to comfort her.

[Miki]
"What's happening... This isn't...good..."

She was so small.
I wondered how much happiness, chance and time it
would take for Miki to grow up invincible.

[Taichi]
"I'm here though."

[Miki]
"Oh...yeah... I'm glad...you're here."
"When I woke up, Mom was gone... There wasn't
any food... I thought I was the only person left..."

[Taichi]
"And it scared you, right?"

She nodded while rubbing at her face.

[Miki]
"I don't want this... I don't..."

[Taichi]
"I guess without people you get lonely."

[Miki]
"...I want to go home..."

[Taichi]
"You want to go back?"

[Miki]
"I want to..."

[Taichi]
"Of course, you want to."

[Miki]
"I want to see Kiri...and everyone else."

I took out my handkerchief.
She instantly wiped her tears.
Her tears almost looked like small liquid pearls.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, huh?"

One week.
Everything ends on Sunday.

[Miki]
*sniffle*

She kept crying.
We arrived at the school with our hands linked.

[Taichi]
"Hey, I have something to do. What about you?"

[Miki]
"I'll wait for Kiri."

[Taichi]
"I see..."
"Alright then."

[Miki]
"Do you have something else to do after?"

She said as she swung her arms around.

[Taichi]
"No."

[Miki]
"Then I'll be waiting...here..."

[Taichi]
"Why don't you wait in the classroom?"

[Miki]
"I don't want to enter a place where there are no
people... I can't breathe."

[Taichi]
"I see...well, I'll be done quickly."

[Miki]
"I'll pay you back for the handkerchief,
something other than money."

Why?
My sexual harassment spirit arose unintentionally.

[Taichi]
"It's fine. No woman should be left to cry without a
handkerchief."

[Miki]
*sniffle*

Really effective phrase.
In the classroom.
Kiri wasn't there.
Her existence, gone.
Kiri's absence was eternal, even if I repeat several
times more.
Even the word eternal was contradicting. We didn't
even had a possibility to be connected anymore.
It was an obvious punishment for using them for my
own desires.
Punishment.
X.
CROSS.
However, we couldn't cross anymore...

[Taichi]
"But...how can I explain this?"

To Miki...
My head hurt.
I went back to the gate.
Miki was crouching down with her head between her
knees.

[Taichi]
"I'm back, Miki."

[Miki]
"Taichi... Kiri didn't come."

[Taichi]
"Maybe she's having a break."

[Miki]
"If so...do you think she's at home?"

[Taichi]
"I wonder...or maybe outside doing something."

[Miki]
"Then I'll go..."
