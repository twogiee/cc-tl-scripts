[Nanaca]
"Yoo-hoo, Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

It was a mystery girl on a bike.

[Taichi]
"It's that weird bike girl, again."

I said what came to mind.

[Nanaca]
"Don't just say whatever comes to mind!"

She caught me.

[Taichi]
"This girl seems a bit strange. I can't begin to
guess who she might be. And I've never seen that
kind of uniform before."

[Nanaca]
"Don't get all defiant and speak before you think..."

[Taichi]
"Your name's Nanaca, right? Or was it Nanoca?"

[Nanaca]
"Gawd, you're too much. Do you ever get tired of
talking?"

[Taichi]
"Which school are you heading to?"

[Nanaca]
"It's a secret."

[Taichi]
"Oh, I see."

I disregarded her and quickly walked away.

[Nanaca]
"Oh, so cold-blooded!"

[Taichi]
"I can walk and talk at the same time."

[Nanaca]
"Well, all right."

[Taichi]
"So, do you want something?"

[Nanaca]
"Of course, I do."

She struck a finger into the air.

[Nanaca]
"I need you to hurry and set up the antenna!"

[Taichi]
"What?"
"The antenna that Misato is using?"

[Nanaca]
"Yeah, that!"
"But I gotta get a move on, I'm running out
of time!"

[Taichi]
"For what?"

[Nanaca]
"For the deadline."

[Taichi]
"What deadline?"

[Nanaca]
"Are you deaf?!"

[Taichi]
"Wh-what are you even talking about?"

She got a little snappy.

[Nanaca]
"We only live once! If we're too self-absorbed in
the now then existence itself will fall into a state
of perpetual stasis before we know it!"
"That is the nature of potentiality! Like when
Wind0ws needs to reset from a cache overflow,
but instead an error keeps happening! Or when-"

The word 'when' barely escaped her mouth
before she suddenly went silent.

[Taichi]
"You're a little neurotic, aren't ya?"

[Nanaca]
"Don't you dare talk to a cutie like me that way!"

*SMACK*

[Taichi]
"Oooff!"

She slapped me right in the face.
The force of the blow sent me spinning skyward
and sideways, and I landed on the ground
completely horizontal.

[Taichi]
"Ugh... Oogh..."

I was baffled at the comical force this girl was
capable of...
Taichi Keyword:
"Comical Force"
The first theory of ultra-science used in ascension
devices like SCARA EM and aether. Anything physical
which mitigates acceleration.
As a result, a metaphysical, comic-esque outcome
occurs. Statistically more prominent in spirited
childhood friends. It's used as a character building
device.

[Nanaca]
"Ah... Sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Such power... As if from the heavens..."

[Nanaca]
"Don't make those kinds of jokes at a girl's
expense!"

She helped me up.

[Taichi]
"Th-that hurt..."

[Nanaca]
"Sorry about that."

[Taichi]
"I guess your personality was also handed down from
the heavens, not just your strength."

[Nanaca]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"Thanks to your scientific prowess, I was able to
survive such a hit."

[Nanaca]
"I don't get it..."

[Taichi]
"But maybe next time, use a bit more pop."
"Because of the atmosphere of the spin. If you
just wanna take someone off their feet it's extremely
potent, but that's just one way to modulate it."
"In other words, a simple, elegant action
degenerates the moment it's controlled by a
grand-stander."

[Nanaca]
"Are you monologuing, or conversing?"

[Taichi]
"...My bad."

Even I didn't know what I was saying.

[Nanaca]
"I guess that's just who you are."

She let out a half-exasperated sigh.

[Nanaca]
"Ah, there's some blood on your cheek."

[Taichi]
"Huh? From just that small show of force?"

[Nanaca]
"Are you still talking about 'force' and all that?"

[Taichi]
"It's just my blood, it's fine."

[Nanaca]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Uh, I'm a bit adverse to blood."

The expression that came and went on Nanaca's face
was something I couldn't replicate if I had tried.
It looked like she was about to cry, then laugh.
However, it certainly wasn't a mixture of the two.
There seemed to be some deep-rooted conflict
behind the expressions.

[Nanaca]
"Taichi..."

An affected voice escaped her lips.
Her face shrank.
Her eyes began to get misty.
Human consciousness is an incredible thing when you
stop to think about it.
If I were your average protagonist...
(Hm...?)
Or some such bewilderment would be my only response
to her reaction.
But in reality the only thing that came to mind was,
inexplicably "Is she going to kiss me?!"
With Nanaca's face a mere couple inches away from
mine, I considered what I should say after we kiss.
Maybe I'd ask her for a few more...?
Even a literary amateur like me knew that fiction
didn't read like reality because reality lacked the
narrative resonance to drive a story.
Reality is too real to come across as plausible.
At the end of the day, fiction is a playful take on
reality.
I silently agreed with myself.
And yet, still no kiss.
*sluuurp*

[Taichi]
"..."

It was a kiss without feeling or taste.
A tongue running up the side of one's face
could be called a kiss, I suppose.

[Nanaca]
"If you cover it in spit, it'll heal faster."

[Taichi]
"Whoa-whoah!"

I began smack, smack, smacking the side
of my head!!

[Taichi]
"Don't just jump to conclusions like that! Tachi,
h-have you no shame?!"

[Nanaca]
"Why are you doing that to yourself?!"

[Taichi]
"Reality?! Narrative resonance?! So much for my
self-styled genius! I'm trash! Internationally
recognized trash!"

[Nanaca]
"G-get a grip...!"

[Taichi]
"I wanna die!"

[Nanaca]
"Hey, hey!"

[Taichi]
"I'm trash. I need to come to terms with that."

[Nanaca]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Toxic trash."
"There are many at Gunjo who are blissfully
unaware."
"I'm always afraid I'll hurt someone."
"Ignorance is what makes it possible to walk into
dangerous situations when you can't do anything to
prevent them."
"Like a cat that jumps in front of a car."
"I need to restrain myself. To be on guard at all
times."
"But..."
"I'd gotten so wrapped up in having fun that I
almost forgot that. What have I become?"
"I'm..."

Nanaca suddenly moved.
This time she took me into her arms.

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, as long as you are having fun, it's fine."

There was a vague sense of tenderness in my heart.
Nanaca's scent.
Strangely enough, none of this excited me like
it would have had it been another girl.
The feeling of her embrace was different from
that of Youko's.

[Nanaca]
"I'm happy to hear you say those things.
Very happy."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaca]
"Being weak doesn't disqualify you from your right
to life."
"If you're still weak, that's fine."

[Taichi]
"Even if I'm weak...?"

I knew that.
But what was it that she knew?

[Taichi]
"You..."

[Nanaca]
"Nanaca."

[Taichi]
"Nanaca..."

I had forgotten.
I had no record of that name written at any juncture
of my past.
So why did she...?

[Nanaca]
"Feel better?"

[Taichi]
"...Yeah."

She let go of me.
Nanaca smiled brightly.

[Taichi]
"You..."
"Do you love me?"

[Nanaca]
"Dummy."

Ack!
She chopped me on the head.

[Nanaca]
"It's not like that."

She denied it, but then tilted her head and
spoke again.

[Nanaca]
"...But yeah, maybe a little."

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, maybe it's a different kind of love than
you imagine."

[Taichi]
"Whaddya mean?"

[Nanaca]
"Well, you're the type who tortured your mother with
perverted pranks ever since you were a child."

[Taichi]
"I didn't have a mother."

[Nanaca]
"Me neither."
"But y'know, maybe your mother would've been happy
for it?"

[Taichi]
"For perverted pranks?"

[Nanaca]
"Yeah."

[Taichi]
"But wouldn't a boy fooling around with his mom be
kind of scandalous? Actually, I guess it's just boys
being boys."

[Nanaca]
"Toxic trash like you needs to decompose in the
ground."

[Taichi]
"Waaahhh!"

[Nanaca]
"Alright, let's go home."

[Taichi]
"You should come by for a bit. I've got some...warm
water for you!"

[Nanaca]
"Hee hee hee, I don't want to be teased, so
I'll just be heading off."

[Taichi]
"I will I will, if you just come over!"

[Nanaca]
"Sounds too risky!"

Nanaca jauntily straddled her bicycle.
As she bent, I could see up her skirt.
She was wearing non-descript gym shorts.

[Taichi]
"Hmph."

...Wait, gym shorts?
The same deep blue shorts that the women's
liberation movement had eliminated as gym wear
so long ago?!

[Taichi]
"N-Nanaca...?"

I began to tremble.
According to rumor, the way they clung to the butt
was superb.

[Nanaca]
"Get that antenna set up lickety-split, okay?"

[Taichi]
"Huh, the antenna?"

That came out of nowhere.

[Nanaca]
"There's potential there, you know!"

The chain of her bike smartly chimed, then began
to turn.
Her tires scraped asphalt, and she was off.

[Taichi]
"What was that all about?"
