I looked for Kiri.
For what reason?
To apologize.
Or else...
I had no idea.
I wandered about the school on impulse.
I found Misato and Miki on the rooftop.
Tomoki and Sakuraba hadn't returned yet.

[Taichi]
"Miki."

[Miki]
"Oh, how was Touko?"

My heart jumped a little...
But that was it.

[Taichi]
"She was fine. So fine that she hates me."

[Miki]
"Yep, all according to plan."

[Taichi]
"I figured as much."

We both laughed.

[Taichi]
"How's the work going?"

[Miki]
"We're working on it somehow."

[Taichi]
"Is that good or bad?"

[Miki]
"Hopefully good?"

[Taichi]
"That's good to hear."

[Miki]
"But there was an explosive sound
in the school earlier."

[Taichi]
"Gah."

Of course, they heard it...

[Miki]
"Earlier, Mimi and I were both shivering and
half-crying so we lost some progress during
that time."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, that's a cute picture."

[Miki]
"I wonder what that was... Honestly, I've been
wanting to go to the restroom but I'm too scared
to go back inside."

[Taichi]
"I'll bring you a portable toilet if you do it in
front of me."

[Miki]
"Wow. What an offer..."

She held her head.
Actually, I didn't have time for this.

[Taichi]
"Well. That was my doing earlier."

[Misato]
"Oh, Is that so... So what was that?"

She looked at me judgmentally.
She must have been really scared.

[Taichi]
"It was an alarm clock."

[Miki]
"Must be defective."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, so I threw it away."

[Misato]
"I see, so it wasn't a terrorist attack. I'm relieved."

[Taichi]
"There's no one to be terrorists."

[Miki]
"Well then, off to restroom I go!"

Miki flapped her hands like a bird and ran away.

[Taichi]
"Make sure you flush!"

[Miki]
"Don't mention that!"

[Taichi]
"Are you gonna flush up? Or down?"

[Miki]
"Up, of course!"

She pulled out her tongue at me and went back into
the school.

[Taichi]
"And I'm off as well..."

[Misato]
"Pekke."

Misato called in a calm voice.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Misato]
"I may have to thank you."

[Taichi]
"Thank me?"

[Misato]
"No, nothing. Where are you headed to?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, just going to look for Kiri."

[Misato]
"You teased her again, didn't you?"

She said as if it was a pleasant thing.

[Taichi]
"Yes, a little. Sorry."

[Misato]
"No worries, that's more important. Make sure
you follow it up."

[Taichi]
"I will."

And the lies stacked.
I followed Kiri's presence.
She went that way so maybe she went to the
classroom...
I didn't think she left the campus.
I went to the first-year classroom.
And then...
She was there.
Her defenselessness was the same as usual.
I decided to approach her.

[Taichi]
"Um, Kiri?"

What did I want to do?
I had no idea.
Did I want to apologize?
Did I want to destroy her?
I had no idea.
Not knowing what I wanted was unpleasant.

[Kiri]
"..."

She turned around and said.

[Kiri]
"You are a filthy killer."

I was taken a bit back...
That wasn't something you usually heard from
underclassmen.

[Taichi]
"It's natural for you to get angry, but..."

[Kiri]
"Angry?"
"It's not that simple."
"You are an enemy. You..."

Her voice was quiet...
So was her gaze.
Quiet... Indictment.

[Kiri]
"You killed Yutaka."

[Taichi]
"..."
"Jeez."
"How did you know such thing?"

[Kiri]
"I just know."
"That day, you were talking to Yutaka on the rooftop."

[Taichi]
"..."

She knew.
She knew, she knew.
Kiri knew about it.

[Taichi]
"That day?"

Oh no.
My heart was suddenly...
I froze up.

[Kiri]
"The day Yutaka died."
"I've always suspected..."
"But, I wasn't sure."
"That's why I didn't want to have anything to do
with you."
"But you approached me."

Kiri had confidence in her eyes.
There were flames dwelling in her pupils, her eyes
weren't wandering anymore.

[Taichi]
"Hold on. That's a bit ridiculous."
"Do you think I'd approach you if I was the one who
killed Yutaka?"

[Kiri]
"I don't think so..."
"Normally."

[Taichi]
"Sure, I'm not really normal, but..."

[Kiri]
"We are all just prey to you."
"You're only trying to feed your hunger."
"What is normal to people doesn't matter.
You are what you are."
"You are a monster that eats people's hearts..."

[Taichi]
"..."

She said as she pleased.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Yutaka and I were friends. I didn't have a
reason to kill him."

[Kiri]
"Motives aren't necessary."
"There's no reason for hunger."

[Taichi]
"Hmmmmm."

I scratched my head.

[Taichi]
"Then why did Yutaka have to be the prey? Let's just
say that I am that monster, and the others are the
prey."
"Don't you think it would be better to go for
girls than guys?"

[Kiri]
"Do you care what gender your fried chicken is?"

[Taichi]
"Uh..."

She had a comeback for everything.

[Kiri]
"At least... That's the way you were looking
at me."

[Taichi]
"That was, well..."
"I'm a guy so, things got kind of exciting and..."

[Kiri]
"That was different."

[Taichi]
"Do you have experience?"

[Kiri]
"No. But I know that it's different."

Right, this girl.
She had an eye.
An eye to spot out evil.
A sharp instinct.
I could see why the world could be a scary place
from her point of view.
She had no doubts anymore with circumstantial
evidence and instinct.

[Kiri]
"I always suspected..."
"But these past few days... I gave in to you."
"That was a mistake..."
"But..."
"Because of that, I understood your true colors."

Kiri hung her hand outside the window.

[Kiri]
"You're..."

And pulled it back in.
A bundle of cloth.
She had it leaning against the other side of the
window frame.
She unraveled the bundle.

[Kiri]
"A filthy murderer."

[Taichi]
"..."

The second one... So that one belonged to Miki.
It seemed like I was led here.

[Kiri]
"Don't move."

[Taichi]
"This is a little embarrassing for a man to say,
but Youko would be very upset."

[Kiri]
"That's fine."
"As long as I can eliminate you."

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

[Kiri]
"Who was next after me? Mimi? Touko? Or Miki?"

[Taichi]
"I wouldn't do that to anyone."

If you could preserve your precious self.
People were always seeking other people, but...
If you gave yourself into another, then it was over.
So you needed to keep your distance before that
happened.
Because the world wasn't really nice.
Kiri of all people should know that.
Did you understand what was going on, Kiri?

[Kiri]
"I don't have any obligation to believe you."

She aimed her weapon.
She'd definitely be able to hit me at that distance.
It was about the same distance as that tree that
Kiri used to practice.
She wasn't going to miss.

[Taichi]
"If I die, you'll die too, you know?"

[Kiri]
"I don't care."

She laughed.

[Kiri]
"Either way, this world has already ended."

[Taichi]
"Even though you don't really hate anyone."

[Kiri]
"That's not the point."
"I just wanted for things to be right!"
"For you too..."

[Taichi]
"..."

She had complete intent to kill.
Kiri was crystallized, wrapped in a distinctive
pattern.
If I had died, Kiri would have died too.
She knew.
Same as Touko.
And then there was me who thought that was okay.
Half of me was longing for others.
I wanted memories.
I wanted to record it.
I wanted to carve it in my heart.
If I had those memories, if I had that precious gem...
Maybe...I really am a monster who fed on other's
emotions.

[Kiri]
"Any last words you want to share before you die?"

Kiri's hand pitifully shivered as she told me.
She was scared.
Scared to kill.
Her heart was on the edge.
Her balloon, made of anxiety and reason, could
easily be popped with a little motivation.
With just the tip of a needle.
I could still live through this.
But I also thought that I should just die.
I hesitated.
