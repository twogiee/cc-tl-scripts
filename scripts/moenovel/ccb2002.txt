Living in the country meant that the nights weren't
too hot.
The cool wind from the window felt really good.

[Taichi]
"I'm starving."

While I spoke to myself, I wrote in my diary.
*grrr*
The bug in my stomach repeatedly yelled, loud and
clear.
Just like how a caged lion showed hostility.

[Stomach]
"Hey you! Eat something or else I'm gonna eat you!"

[Taichi]
"Shut up. Is this some kind of joke?"

[Stomach]
"I'm hungry! Eat something! It's not just my
problem, you know?!"

[Taichi]
"So impatient. Eat your own legs like that octopus
in some poem. You'll be immortal if you eat them
all."

[Stomach]
"Don't make a fool out of me! Are you messing with
me?!"

[Taichi]
"If so, then what's wrong, huh?"

[Stomach]
"I'll beat you up!"

[Taichi]
"Try me, you imaginary thing!"

[Stomach]
"Don't you dare look down on me! I'm as reckless as
a spoilt son of a celebrity who grew up on a suite!"

[Taichi]
"Huh, that's cool. But even if you insist, you're
also as powerless as a celebrity's son since you're
locked up inside a human body."

[Stomach]
"Speak for youself!"

When you're a being of my level, higher level of
thinking and communication with conceptual existence
was possible.
Generally, you called them "people with dishevelled
minds and unusual behavior."
There was a more articulate way of saying "People
with dishevelled minds and unusual behavior," but I
refrained from saying it.
But who cares! (crying)

[Taichi]
"I really am hungry though."

Maybe I should eat something.
I went downstairs.
The fridge was empty.
It wasn't plugged in either, so I guess nothing
would have kept anyway.
I foraged through the cupboard.
There was no bread either.
There wasn't even any jerky.
Then I found dreams and hope.
But they're completely useless to keep so I threw it
away.
There was pepper.
There were potatoes too.
I grabbed the sauce.
I grabbed the salt.
I grabbed the sugar.

[Taichi]
"There's my meal!"

I lined everything on the table.

[Taichi]
"Now let's dig in!"

*fwip fwip*
I nibbled on a raw salted potatoes while making
similar sounds to shaving.

[Taichi]
"So this is what fresh potatoes taste like... It's
reasonably hard, just like a rock..."
"And how come I'm eating such a thing! Stop making
fun of me!"

I chucked it.

[Taichi]
"Ugh! I even ate the buds!
Those are poisonous! (True)."

And then I noticed.

[Taichi]
"There's nothing to eat?!"

I was astonished.

[Taichi]
"That's right, if there's no bread then I can eat
cake... Hah!"

It's a funny joke that would for sure send the
starving population into fits of convulsive
laughter.
It goes to show that the people have that kind of
generosity.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, let's just get pizza."

I made a phone call.

[Taichi]
"Hi, this is Kurosu. I'd like one medium size
doubcheespesh..."

*Doubcheespesh: A real word.
Short for double cheese special.
That was how everyone called it.

[Taichi]
"The place has closed down."

I burst into tears.

[Taichi]
"There were so many items from the menu that I
hadn't tried!"

I started regretting my whole life.

[Taichi]
"Well that's it, I have potatoes."

I could just steam them.
I went out into the garden.
I refered to a survival comic and prepared the rice
cooker to steam the potatoes.

[Taichi]
"It's ready..."

Steaming was troublesome so I decided to bake them.
There was a simple way to make potatoes with butter.
I made a fire pit.
The flame danced around.
I heated up stones.
I gave each potato a name.
I threw each foil-covered potatoes as I grieve (adds
flavor to the potatoes) into the stones.
I waited.
I teared up.
I waited.
I wiped my tears.
I waited.
I overcame the sadness and grew up as a person.
I waited.
I quit waiting.
I stopped the bug in my belly.
I took it off the heat and transferred it to a plate.
Butter...was not present so I just used the salt.
I ignored the trivial questions like, "You call this
potatoes with butter?"
I ate.

[Taichi]
"Hot hot hot."

But it was delicious.
I was still alive.
Then I saw someone fall at the entrance.

[Taichi]
"Huh."

I rushed over.
It was none other than Touko Kirihara.

[Touko]
"Wahhh."

I looked down at Touko while munching away at a
potato.

[Touko]
"Wahhh."

I bit into my second potato.

[Touko]
"Someone..."

I bit into my third...

[Touko]
"Hurry up and help me out here..."

[Taichi]
"So you can talk."

[Touko]
"Ooh..."

She looked like she was in pain.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

[Touko]
"The smell of the food..."

[Taichi]
"Um. Did you follow the smell to get here?"

[Touko]
"..."

Her reactions ceased.

[Taichi]
"..."

After finishing my third potato, I lifted Touko up.
*munch munch munch*
Touko gobbled up the potatoes.

[Taichi]
"..."

Without any seasoning.
She ate as if she had no time to chew.
She ate fiercely, courageously, and thoroughly.
Now that I think about it, Touko was always shy
eating in front of other people.
That was a rare sight.

[Taichi]
"Nitta..."

[Touko]
"Mm..."

[Taichi]
"Kasai..."

[Touko]
"Mm..."

[Taichi]
"Ugajin..."

[Touko]
"What are you going on about...?"

[Taichi]
"It's the innocent people that were the potatoes,
now turned into your flesh and blood."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

I placed a piece of potato on her cheeks
and Touko looked back at me suspiciously.

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it."
"Their life has been succeeded."

I pressed my hands together in prayer.

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind."

She looked confused for a while.
She recharged again.

[Touko]
"Ah..."

She got a cramp in her legs and arms.

[Taichi]
"Here, water."

I passed her a water bottle.

[Touko]
*gulp gulp gulp*

She drank it all up.

[Touko]
"Uh...uh..."

She started eating again.
She looked like an adult, but acted like a child...
She went for a seventh one, then eighth, then she
finally caught her breath.

[Touko]
"Now I've calmed down..."

[Taichi]
"That's good."

Touko corrected her posture.
She hung her head down, then looked at me
with upturned eyes.
So I also looked at Touko.
I gazed right at her.

[Touko]
"Don't look at me."

She blushed and looked down.
Well, that was cute.
Then I felt a little nervous.

[Taichi]
"N-No, what are you talking about.
You're the one staring at me."

[Touko]
"I was going to say thanks!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, right, go ahead."

[Touko]
"Uhm..."

She started over.

[Touko]
"Th..."
"Thanks..."

It felt awkward.

[Taichi]
"All good."
"I didn't think you were hungry."

Touko blushed even more.

[Taichi]
"Don't you have food at home?"

[Touko]
"I do, but..."
"I don't know how to cook."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"
"But you said you were good at cooking before."

[Touko]
"I'm sorry..."
"That was a lie..."

[Taichi]
"A lie!"

No...

[Touko]
"Sorry."

[Taichi]
"But the lunch you made before..."

[Touko]
"I lied. It was actually our maid who cooked
everything."

No, no!

[Taichi]
"How old is your maid?"

[Touko]
"Around 45."

No, no... NOOOO!!!

[Taichi]
"I was so fluttered from a lunch made by some old
woman..."

[Touko]
"I'm sorry..."

[Taichi]
"You're horrible."

I broke down into tears.
But then.

[Taichi]
"Wait, so it means that you have meat or canned food
at home?"

[Touko]
"What are canned foods?"

[Taichi]
"Are you serious?!"

She didn't know of canned foods?
She didn't know what those words meant?
Touko the encyclopedia had no idea
what those two words meant?
I mean, yeah, I knew she was rich and all but... Was
she for real?

[Taichi]
"Doesn't caviar come in a can?"

I trembled while asking.

[Touko]
"In a jar. We get it sent to us from overseas
in a wooden box every week."

She had caviar on a regular basis?!

[Taichi]
"If there's no cake prepared then just go eat your
caviar and bread, you rich phony!"

[Touko]
"Why are you so angry?
And what do you mean by cake?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, precious caviar! To be eaten by this girl who
lacks such appreciation for you!"

I personified it and showed pity.

[Touko]
"You crying doesn't really help here."

[Taichi]
"If so, just tell me what you did to that caviar you
take such pride in!"

[Touko]
"We don't have any for this week.
Nothing came yesterday."

[Taichi]
"What about last week's?"

[Touko]
"I didn't eat it, let alone even open it...
So I threw it away since it would spoil."

[Taichi]
"What?!"

I bent right back.
Then fell to the floor.

[Touko]
"Huh?! What's wrong?"

I stayed in a bridge position and felt cramps
all over my body.

[Taichi]
"You threw away caviar... It was going to spoil so
you threw it away... Before it turned..."

[Touko]
"Foaming from the mouth?!"

[Taichi]
"While I lost all my savings from since I was a kid
of custody of a child in Chinese shares..."
"You threw away caviar!!"

[Touko]
"You're not making any sense..."

[Taichi]
"You rich people!"

Touko looked down.

[Touko]
"Money is useless anyway..."

[Taichi]
"That's true but..."

[Touko]
"I envy that you can cook, Kurosu."

[Taichi]
"I wouldn't call it cooking since all I did was bake
it."

Anyone could do that.
As long as they read some sort of survival comic.

[Touko]
"It's a hassle having to put effort just to live."

A rich kid's speech.
This girl's house had a housekeeper.
In other words, a maid.
She was Madame Touko.
In other words, she's been brought up with
everything being done for her automatically, 
without her doing anything herself.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, you'll never survive on your own."

[Touko]
"Shut it..."

Her weak refutation demonstrated affirmation.

[Taichi]
"Privileged rich kid..."

[Touko]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Touko]
"Can't I just live here?"

I doubted my ears.
This girl seriously weakened.
There wasn't even a hint of hesitation in her voice.
She didn't have anyone to rely on.
And inevitably, she came to me.
Ah, too complicated.
Since Touko and I were...
Ohhhhh (in agony).
