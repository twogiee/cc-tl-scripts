Touko was daydreaming in the classroom as usual.
She didn't talk to anyone.
She didn't participate in any clubs.
She was just there, without a purpose.

[Taichi]
"..."

She was honest.
Proper as a person.
One day, it all changed.
An object at rest, tends to stay at rest.
Quite ironic if you thought about it.
All the other people in the world had vanished,
and had left only us behind.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara..."

[Touko]
"..."

Hrrmm.

[Taichi]
"Dialog."

[Touko]
"Hmm?"

She appeared dubious for a moment, then went back
to her cage of meditation (at least pretended to).

[Taichi]
"Dialog!"

I said it like a zombie.

[Taichi]
"Dialog, dialog."
"Dialog!"

[Touko]
"What do you want?!"

I was a dialog monster.
No, a monster-like dialog.
Hrrmm?
Well, okay.

[Taichi]
"Conversation. Dialog. Necessary."

I used gestures to emphasize.

[Touko]
"There's no need."

[Taichi]
"There's no existence without interaction."

[Touko]
"Whatever."
"Don't talk to me."
"You don't really care about me at all!"

[Taichi]
"That's not true."
"I like the pretty Touko."

[Touko]
"Is THAT something you do to someone you like?!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Touko]
"Lies!"

[Taichi]
"It's true."

[Touko]
"But, but but..."

She was at a loss for words.

[Touko]
"Don't talk to me."

She decided to stop talking.
Incomplete combustion.
It just made you want to talk more when 
someone harshly tells you not to.
And when you speak, again, they harshly tell 
you not to talk to them.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."
