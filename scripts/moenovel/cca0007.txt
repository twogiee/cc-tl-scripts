The cicadas were so noisy.
They always tried so hard.
The heat didn't put them off.

[Taichi]
"Well now..."

What to do now...
The rooftop under the blazing sun didn't have a
shadow to hide in.
Of course, the nearby classrooms that I peeked into 
were in the middle of class.
First-year, Class E.
Ms. Machiko was teaching.
Machiko Satou.
An attractive lady, 173 cm tall, with a dynamite
body and plump lips.
She had lustrous, dark blue hair and her sharp looks
were accentuated with brand-name glasses. In my
book, she was of the greatest life-forms alive.
It was her second year teaching.
She had become a teacher in the same year I started
school.
And now she more than knew the ropes.
However, Ms. Machiko was sinful.
Very sinful.
So sinful, that her shirt couldn't contain her sins.
Her massive breasts could burst out of her shirt at
any moment, like someone had taken the tessellation
slider on her chest and cranked it to the right.
Those were the kinds of thoughts she made me conjure
up, which wasn't good for me in many ways.
Her butt was also an atrocious weapon.
Just as dangerous as a mad kid
with a knife in his hand.
Crowded inside of a mouth-watering tight skirt,
practically crying out:
"This rump ain't staying in this trunk!"
All wrapped up tightly.
I thought about what it would be like to take a
box-cutter to her skirt more than a couple times.
Yeah, she was a dangerous woman, all right.
Her younger sister attended the same school (grade
A, athletic, popular).
The principal and school bullies might make life
hard for her sister if she didn't "relieve" them.
I made a point of wanting to protect her from that
lewd, novel-esque scenario.
So in my first year, I assumed responsibility for
harassing Ms. Machiko, instead. She ran out of class
in tears, and didn't come back for three days.
Then I got suspended, and others teased me, calling
me "Suspended-Boy."
But, that made us closer so all good there.
Anyhow.
My interaction with Ms. Machiko was no more
after that.
Co-teacher changed as the second year came,
and she was no longer in her usual class.
Goodbye fond memories.
Responsible sexual harassment has to be enjoyed in
moderation.
I wish I fondled her a bit more if I was going to be
hated anyhow... I just heard myself... Yeah, I'm
probably a lost cause at this point.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

Anyway, someone was gonna find me if I kept roaming
around the hallway.
I decided to go buy a meal ticket, then head to the
clubroom.
Perfect plan out of nowhere.
Meal A would be sold out by third period, so I had
to go to the cafeteria right after first period if I
wanted it.
There'd still a line, regardless.
Being late for second period was a common
occurrence.
If it occurred too many times, the school would
enforce the "Cancellation of Early Purchase Meal
Tickets" rule.
Not that they'd have to if they had more meals
stocked in the first place.
Everyone thought that.
But in order to prevent left-overs, they limited the
amount of meals.
So I wasn't going to let this chance go by.
And since it was the middle of first period, there
shouldn't be a line.
There was no one in sight.

[Taichi]
"Hey Lunch Lady, Meal A please."

Meal ticket bought, no problem.
Easy peasy.
All right, I guess I'll head to the clubroom for now.
There was someone sitting down reading a magazine
when I entered the clubroom.

[Taichi]
"Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Tomoki."
"Didn't expect to see you here. What's that? Could
it be that you also go for these types too?"

I then raised my pinky finger.

[Tomoki]
"Oh, right..."

I was met with a dull-faced response.
Tomoki was never the type to ad-lib very well.
He's a good guy, but can come across as tedious for
those not used to him.

[Taichi]
"You're skipping class?"

[Tomoki]
"Same to you."
"Our class was canceled."

He continued to read his magazine, and sipped his
carton of coffee milk.
That makes sense.
That's why he left to chill here.
It almost pissed me off how he acted all Neutral
Evil, when he's so blatantly Chaotic Good.

[Taichi]
"Meal ticket?"

[Tomoki]
"I bought one."

[Taichi]
"Nice."

[Tomoki]
"..."

Am I being ignored here?
I'm spent.
The broadcast club had every character archetype
covered, and some of them, like Tomoki, just didn't
do ad lib.
I looked out the window.
It was awfully bright outside.

[Taichi]
"Another hot day."

[Tomoki]
"There's another one in the fridge."

[Taichi]
"Was it 80 yen?"

[Tomoki]
"Yup."

[Taichi]
"I'll take it."

I dropped some change in his hand and opened the
fridge.

[Tomoki]
"Uhh, you got anything bigger than ten yen coins?"

I ignored him and took a sip from the carton.

[Tomoki]
"Jeez."

He didn't pursue it any further. Time sluggishly
passed by.
Various monitors and equipment were lined up on a
long table by the window.
The broadcast club's equipment.
We were right next door to the broadcasting room.
To be precise, we were in the prep room, a hangout
spot.
We hooked up a mini fridge, and set up game consoles
and cell phone chargers. It's like this room was a
middle finger to The Man.

[Taichi]
"Huh, why is the stuff unplugged?"

[Tomoki]
"I was going to rewire it for the new machine."

[Taichi]
"Right..."

Tomoki was quite the computer-kid, he often geeked
out over CPU memory with Miki.
He also had a cute girlfriend, a year younger, who
attended a different school. He had met her on an
internet forum.
Once, I had gone to visit Tomoki while he had been
hospitalized.
I had gone to his room in the hospital when:
"U-um, th-th-thanks for visiting Tomoki."
I vaguely remember the shock I felt seeing a super
cute girl in uniform bowing to me.
Yuuka was her name. She took care of Tomoki from
then on.
She'd probably even give Tomoki her underwear
if he wished.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"Ow! What was that for?!"

[Taichi]
"Suddenly felt frustrated..."

[Tomoki]
"Huh, for what? What's the big dealio."

Tomoki always made the lamest jokes.
I can't believe he had attracted such a cute girl.
It was wrong. Filthy.

[Girl]
"Heheh."

I heard someone giggling.

[Taichi]
"Huh, you were here?"

A small girl in glasses stepped out from the
broadcasting room.

[Girl]
"You two are just as usual..."

[Tomoki]
"Us two..."

Miyuki Fukuhara, she was my junior.

[Taichi]
"Hey. What's up?"
"Ooh? What's this?"

[Miyuki]
"Wh-what?"

Miyuki stood back with caution.

[Both]
Miyuki: "You're just going to call me boring again,
right?"
Taichi: "What a boring little girl."

[Miyuki]
"Aaarrrgh..."

The small girl shivered with barely contained rage.

[Taichi]
"Hmm, I wonder, why you're so simple and boring."
"Why does your hairband look so cheap?
Why are your eyebrows like that?
Why don't you shorten your skirt more?"

[Miyuki]
"Aaah, not the skirt..."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

[Miyuki]
"Don't rub my neck like that... Whoa, don't put your
finger in my ear!"

Just a few touches here and there that definitely
wouldn't be considered sexual harassment.

[Taichi]
"You have such potential too."

[Miyuki]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"What a waste, what a waste."
"I guess I'll take a bite so you don't go to waste."

[Miyuki]
"Huh?"

*nibble*
I bent forward, and nibbled on her ear.
She smelled like a girl, all right.
Pretty sure this passes for sexual harassment,
Prince Charming act or not.

[Miyuki]
"Aaawhaaa?!"

Miyuki squirmed.

[Tomoki]
"Why don't you stop there, you bully."

[Taichi]
"Oh, what's this, locking on to another one even
though you already have a girlfriend?"

[Tomoki]
"Th-that has nothing to do with this!"

[Taichi]
"You 'love-sniper.' I mean, really."

I spat on the floor.

[Taichi]
"My love rifle will always be aimed at a simple and
boring-"

The door to the broadcasting room closed as I looked
back.
The lock clicked into place.
Miyuki was no longer here.

[Taichi]
"Ugh."

I glared at Tomoki, who was reading his manga
like nothing had happened.

[Taichi]
"Is that kindness the key to getting the girls?"

[Tomoki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing. What was my Miyuki up to anyhow?"

[Tomoki]
"You make it sound like you own the juniors."

[Taichi]
"But they're our juniors, no?"

Silence filled the air.

[Tomoki]
"I still think they deserve some respect."
"By the way, Fukuhara's class was canceled."

[Taichi]
"Ahh, I see, I see."

My Interest waned as the mystery was solved.

[Taichi]
"I wonder if someone busted out again?"

[Tomoki]
"Maybe so."

I sat back down.
The summer sunlight hadn't made its way into the
room yet.

[Taichi]
"Gotta love the broadcasting club, just being able
to use this room is pretty sweet."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah."

Tomoki gave lazy responses when he was reading.

[Taichi]
"What're you reading?"

[Tomoki]
"Psychoman."

[Taichi]
"Yatsuka dies and Shinzaki turns out to be the
culprit."

[Tomoki]
"Don't tell me that!!"

[Taichi]
"You wanna go?!"

[Tomoki]
"Don't say anything else, and don't even think about
spoiling Evil Beast Archipelago!"

[Taichi]
"Father Anderson saves his disciple who was
kidnapped by spies!"

[Tomoki]
"Stop speaking!"

[Taichi]
"Freedom of speech!"

[Tomoki]
"You traitor!"

[Taichi]
"Knowledge is power!"

We scuffled.
The door opened, Miyuki popped her face in and
urgently whispered to us.

[Miyuki]
"Seniors! Teacher incoming!"

[Tomoki]
"Huh!"
"Wha... Taichi?"

He didn't hide in time, what a fool.
I had already positioned myself in a blind spot
from the hallway.
Tomoki hesitated between going left and right.

[Miyuki]
"This way!"

He dropped to the ground and escaped to the
broadcast room.
With Miyuki.
If only I had done that...
Shoot, don't cry now...
As the door closed, a 190 cm body of muscle crossed
the hallway.
A mammoth.
Juuzou Manda.
AKA "Mammoth." A corporal punishment genius.
Who knew what would happen if he found me.
I once saw him crush a soda can into the size
of a ping-pong ball with one hand.
His punishments had been well adapted for the 21st
century.
He'd mastered the art of showing you pain without
leaving any trace of it.
Somehow he managed to fly under the PTA's radar.
The Mammoth had the terrifying sly muscle of a
marmoset.
The giant thudded past.
He glanced inside the room on his way.

[Juuzou]
"..."

And he was gone.
I cursed him under my breath.

[Taichi]
"Shouldn't a fossil like that been buried in the
Siberian wastes?"

I came out from my little hiding spot.

[Tomoki]
"Well, that was close."

[Miyuki]
"We need curtains on the hallway windows."

[Tomoki]
"It's not allowed because the school knows it's a
bad idea."

[Taichi]
"I got a plan."

[Miyuki]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I know how you two think of me. But it's not a joke,
I really do have a good plan."

[Miyuki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, get the machine all up and ready. And get a
camera."

[Tomoki]
"Huh?"
