[Taichi]
"Go! Go!"

And then...

[Taichi]
"We made it."

[Kiri]
*huff* *pant*

Kiri was exhausted.

[Miki]
"Oh! Perfect timing!"

Miki was perfectly fine.
She must have a lot of energy.

[Taichi]
"I'm glad we made it before it got dark, but we also
have to head back at some point."

Well, if we needed it, I had flashlights in the
Taichi Bag.

[Miki]
"I wanted to see the sunset, so it's perfect."
"All right!"

Miki walked with a beauty on each arm (one of them
was me).

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

[Kiri]
*yelp*

[Miki]
"It's most beautiful right before it sets."

That would be in another thirty minutes.

[Kiri]
"Ugh. I'm hungry."

[Miki]
"Did you bring any food?"

[Taichi]
"I did."

I took out some crackers I had left over.

[Miki]
"Is there anything you don't have in that tattered
old bag of yours?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it is the Taichi Bag after all."

[Miki]
"I'm thirsty."

[Taichi]
"I've got you covered."

I produced a canteen.

[Miki]
"That's pretty cool."

She looked really thirsty.

[Taichi]
"Want a biscuit?"

Youko had made them.

[Miki]
"Sure! Here you go, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Uh, thanks..."

They both ate greedily.

[Miki]
"These biscuits...sure are tasty."

[Kiri]
"Yeah. They're soft...and sweet..."

[Taichi]
"Youko's biscuits never disappoint."

[Miki]
"She really loves you, huh."

[Taichi]
"It's just favoritism if anything."

It was more trouble than it was worth.

[Taichi]
"Though it'd be nice if she'd lay off with the
surveillance camera."

In my room.
Though I guess it couldn't do much without
electricity.

[Kiri]
"So what are you waiting for, Miki?"

[Miki]
"The sunset?"

[Kiri]
"But this is the sunset, isn't it ?"

[Taichi]
"Miki is waiting for the afterglow."

[Kiri]
"Afterglow?"

[Taichi]
"You know how the sky goes orange after the sun dips
below the horizon? That's the afterglow."

[Miki]
"We'll watch it together. Doesn't that sound
amazing?"

It was more like emotional companionship
than a date.

[Miki]
"Meow meow meow! Meow meow meow!"

[Kiri]
"D-don't touch my breasts!"

Well, it seemed fun, so whatever.

[Taichi]
"Your pent up desire is suffocating, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Pfft!!"

[Taichi]
"Don't spit."

[Kiri]
"You talked?! Did you show him?!"

[Miki]
"Calm down. I didn't show him anything."

I only had a vague idea of what happened.

[Taichi]
"Do you remember your first day in club?"

[Kiri]
"Umm, more or less."
"How could I ever forget that?"

[Miki]
"They wouldn't let you join for a long time."

[Taichi]
"Well, I had to complete the test first. Show
aptitude, you know."

Not anyone could just join clubs on a whim...
Though they did take requests.
After all, Gunjo only took students with a high
adaptation score.
Kiri had showed up last summer.
And Miki had arrived soon after that.
Both of them had been admitted as third-year
students.
We had all been in the same building, I remember
meeting a lot of people at the time.

[Miki]
"That time had been pretty fun. I won't be
forgetting it anytime soon."

[Kiri]
"Fun, huh...?"

[Taichi]
"It was. That was when I gave you your
fabulous nicknames."

[Miki]
"Umm, Shima was 'The Immoral,' and Taichi was 'The
Love Aristocrat.' right?"

Good memory.

[Miki]
"Talk of The Love Aristocrat came up constantly..."

[Kiri]
"And mistresses, too... It was awful."
"Perhaps you should start calling yourself
The Awful Aristocrat?"

[Taichi]
"...Awful?"

[Miki]
"You're being mean, Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Do you remember Sakuraba's talk about nuts?"

[Kiri]
*gasp*

Kiri nearly exploded.
I guess she did remember.

[Miki]
"About that. I have a question."
"Does Sakuraba have trouble hearing?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, his eardrums hurt."

[Miki]
"Wha?"

[Kiri]
"I had no idea."

[Taichi]
"It's my fault."

Kiri raised an eyebrow.

[Kiri]
"It's not funny."

[Taichi]
"Well, listen up. I'll explain what happened."
"When I was still a little brat... Maybe second year
or so, we had our school festival."

[Miki]
"We don't have them now, huh."

[Taichi]
"That's because of some stuff that happened."
"It was much smaller back then. Since there were
only a few normies."

*Normies = those capable of human emotion and
mentally stable.

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Normally, you'd want the consent of the people
living in the area. Even with this school."
"While it was only a school festival, students
worried about the presence of so many strangers, so
we did a volunteer play if I recall."
"That year...it was Shakespeare. The program was..."

[Kiri]
"Romeo and Juliet."

[Taichi]
"Correct."

That's right.

[Miki]
"The old standard."

[Taichi]
"Hmm. Or stand-in."

[Kiri]
"What?"

[Miki]
"The personification of standard..."

[Kiri]
"Ah, that's what you mean..."

[Taichi]
"Heheheh. Nice follow-up, Miki."

[Miki]
"Don't mention it."

[Taichi]
"The day I explain my jokes will be the day I die."

[Kiri]
"Sounds like someone in a movie would say."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, the point is it was Shakespeare.
Or...Mr. Shakey Spear...!"

Miki shuddered.

[Miki]
"You weren't even trying to make the joke funny!"

My honesty claimed another victim.

[Taichi]
"No twists as a rule."

I looked up at the red sky like a downtrodden boxer.

[Kiri]
"So, would this even be considered a joke?"

[Miki]
"Who knows?"

[Taichi]
"Take a guess at the cast!"

[Miki]
"You were Romeo, I suppose?"

[Kiri]
"Wasn't anyone else available at the time...?"

[Taichi]
"Youko was one grade higher."

[Miki]
"So, Hasekura was Juliet."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, but you've got it backwards."

[Miki]
"Reversed roles...?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Our bodies were of the same build back then,
so we could play either role."
"Also, because nobody else was stable enough to
perform, Youko and I had to play all of the roles."

[Kiri]
"Whoa..."

[Miki]
"And that was for the school festival?"

[Taichi]
"Well, for the sake of appearances..."
"The play was a rousing success. It's rare that
amateurs...give you such a...believable kissing
scene..."

[Kiri]
"Is he...crying?"

[Miki]
"I wonder why."

[Taichi]
"Damn it! I didn't have any experience at that
point!"

[Miki]
"As opposed to now?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, much saliva and drool passed between us
during that kiss..."
"As the heroine, I tried to wriggle free, but the
lead was trying her best to restrain me."
"There was much that the audience couldn't see, but
that in itself is the magic of theater."
"The play was a rousing success. It succeeded in
forcing me to change my underwear."

[Kiri]
"Eww..."

[Taichi]
"And then a new character... Sakuraba appeared!"

[Miki]
"Of course."

[Taichi]
"He was a man who was loyal to his instincts.
Maybe too loyal."
"He came to see the play, and it was love at first
sight."

[Kiri]
"Of Youko?"

[Taichi]
"No, of me."

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Both]
"Whaaaat!!!"

Their scream nearly shattered my eardrums.

[Miki]
"Huh? He fell in love with you?!"

[Kiri]
"So wait, does that mean that the rumors that
Sakuraba isn't interested in girls are...?"

[Miki]
"Whoa! Who knows?!"

[Kiri]
"Whoa. Whooooaaa."

[Miki]
"Eeek! Eeek!"

Shut up already...

[Both]
"So what happened next?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno why but your harmonies are irritating me."
"Anyway. Sakuraba was really persistent. He showed
up just backstage with a flower he picked from the
principal's garden."
"I was surprised. Meeting to going out in three
seconds. Way too fast for my taste."

They both held their breath.
I kinda didn't want to talk about it anymore.

[Taichi]
"Unfortunately, Youko wasn't there."
"But I kept my cool. I mean, I'm a man, right?
I couldn't just let Sakuraba have his way with me."
"So I showed him...something to prove that I was a
man. Something that would leave no doubt of my
manhood."

[Miki]
"You're lying..."

[Kiri]
"Yeah, he must be."

[Miki]
"Enough with the bad jokes."

[Kiri]
"Yeah, but whatever. The story's interesting, at
least."

[Taichi]
"Can I cry now..."
"Well, Sakuraba didn't stop."

"I don't care if you're a man."

[Taichi]
"That's when he attacked me. The truth was that my
body did have what it took to receive his 'love.'"

[Miki]
"Oooooooo!"

[Kiri]
"A-and that means..."

They looked like they were enjoying the story a
little too much.

[Taichi]
To protect my chastity, I struck out at him. My palm
hit him full force on the ear. I guess it kinda
wounded him.

[Miki]
"Ah, that's why his ear..."

[Taichi]
"He and his father apologized soon after. But they
didn't sue me for what I did. It was an assault
after all."
"He originally wouldn't listen to anyone,
but he got better after that."
"Then he was taken to the hospital, and that was the
end of it."
"And when the school started, I had him as
a classmate."

[Kiri]
"Did he come after you?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe..."

[Miki]
"And when what happened?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing! He also wasn't interested in doing
anything to my asterisk."
(My asterisk: )

[Miki]
"So it was platonic lo-"

[Taichi]
"Don't you even dare."

I was troubled.

[Taichi]
"The truth is that my feelings on the matter
were very complex."

[Miki]
"And that's why you bullied him."

[Taichi]
"I didn't know how else to respond..."
"Besides, he becomes abnormally kind to me when I
leave him alone."

I got goosebumps.

[Taichi]
"That was too much for me. I mean, I just wanted a
normal human relationship. It was tough age for
everyone. The end. Interesting, right?"

They nodded their heads.

[Miki]
"It was, very, interesting!"

[Taichi]
"Misato and Touko also got all strange
after hearing it... Women..."

[Miki]
"Eeek! Eeek!"

[Kiri]
"Eeek! Eeek!"

They're already all like "Eeek! Eeek!"
Such shrill voices.
I could only sigh.
I finally told everyone.

[Taichi]
"So Miki, isn't it about time we should be going?"

[Miki]
"Oh... Yeah."

The sunken sun. It was the only light left that
clung to the sky.
The color was burnt into the sky like a haze of pure
heat.

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Huh."

It was really something.
Even without people, the world still turned.

[Kiri]
"Wow."

It was overwhelming.
Unable to speak, we were all enchanted by what we
saw.
And before long...

[Miki]
"Ahah."

Her laughter was wild and uncontrolled.

[Miki]
"Ahahah. Ahahahahahahah."

She was crying.
She forced my arm toward her.

[Miki]
*sob sob*

[Kiri]
"What is it, Miki?"

[Miki]
"It's beautiful... So beautiful..." *sob*

[Taichi]
"Miki..."

We couldn't understand why she was crying.
We were just troubled by it.

[Miki]
"It's beautiful... Beautiful..." *sob*

With her crying voice, the afterglow
vanished below the horizon.

[Miki]
"Uwaaaaaaah!"

She sobbed uncontrollably.
