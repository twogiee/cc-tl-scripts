She was always alone.
She never associated with relatives nor house
servants.
The Isolated Princess...
That's what I called her by myself.
We never exchanged words.
I was interested in her though.
I didn't know what kind of people maintained this
mansion nor what kind of path it took to end up like
it was.
But that place was a paradise isolated from time
itself.
The people who stayed there were the types that
fled from life.
Sometimes I would be invited by the ladies for some
sweet drinks.
I dressed up, enjoyed some tea, invited people, took
walks.
At the beginning of every month, mass amounts of
books, clothes and luxury goods were received.
The yard was spacious too.
There were gardeners who maintained it.
Even if you considered the place was isolated and
being cheap, the place was boundless.
The mansion felt like an unbounded world for a child
like me.
I actually didn't have any memories prior to living
in that mansion.
The size of the mansion and world I lived in was the
same.
From a certain time, the ladies started to have
interest in me.
They told me I had face of girl.
Also, my white hair and my eyes, which had a
mystical pattern when seen closely, kept them busy.
They dressed me in girls (especially gorgeous)
dresses.
And I had tea with them.
Children didn't know the true taste of tea.
But I accompanied them anyways.
Defying them wasn't an option for me, especially
towards the people who showed sweetness.
Also, I didn't mind it...
It was boring, but easy.
My duty of having kids ride me like a horse and
pulling my hair as if I were toy, was now being a
cute doll for the ladies.
But she... The Isolated Princess, looked at me with
a cold stare.
No, she wasn't even looking.
She didn't have any interest, and her gazes were
always passing right through me.
Youko Hasekura.
The youngest daughter.
But, it seemed like the family didn't show love to
her so much.
Rather, she was neglected.
I could understand that she lived in a different
world than the ladies living their fantasies.
...In the world called reality.
Once, I was recruited for cleaning duty.
This was before I became a doll.
I participated with the house servants.
They didn't hire anybody from the outside so
manpower always came from servants from within the
mansion.
We cleaned the rooms one by one, with an hour 
break at 10 o'clock and 3 o'clock.
I arrived at her room in the afternoon.
That was the first time I heard her voice.
"This room is fine..."
Short and cold.
Efficient.
But alluring.
In a short glance, I could never imagine the room
belonged to a girl.
There were multiple computers.
Walls covered with bookshelves, and floors stacked
with books that didn't fit on the shelves.
Heavy-duty work table with tools that were worn out.
The room was filled with knowledge and technology
like it was a secret base.
It was like she was an outsider, living in an outside
world.
With a pretty little dress and a feminine voice, I
asked about Youko Hasekura to the ladies during tea
time.
A quiet elder lady answered.
Youko was the daughter of the youngest son.
A cheerful young lady chimed in.
Youko was not a daughter they wished for.
Then the three sisters chirped off one after
another.
They spoke of a love story between a master and his
servant, and the consequences of that love.
They spoke of the daughter who was not loved, a
tragedy waiting to happen.
The disgrace of being the bloodline of the Hasekura
but not a part of the family.
In short, an unwanted child. An accident.
No one spoke to her and she spoke to no one.
A tumor.
Her real father, the young master, took off
overseas to study abroad.
Her mother, the young servant...passed away.
A young girl who couldn't be anybody.
A young girl who wasn't needed by anyone.
She was hurt.
No. She wasn't.
Youko Hasekura was strong.
She didn't care at all.
She probably knew.
That the world was a boxed garden.
I went to the library during my doll life.
I might have been influenced.
I learned manners and how to serve tea from the
ladies.
But, there was no knowledge, skill, or truth of the
real world there.
I frequently visited the library, which hardly
anyone used, to fill that gap.
I met Youko there often.
Still, no conversation.
I found it kind of annoying, so I didn't approach
her either.
I had interest in her but had no desire to become
friends.
My aesthetic trend seemed to be established
at this point.
How should I say it... I was attracted to things
that were independent.
Ones who lived independently and had the power to do
so.
Knowledge. Technology. Independence.
People swarmed.
They had the need to swarm.
But at the same time, they tried to hold their
personal space.
They wanted a place of their own where no one could
trespass.
But your boundaries swayed when they came in contact
with others.
Territory grew and shrank.
Discomfort.
Contradiction.
Typically, one manned hero was more valued than a
magnificent army of a thousand.
The Absolute One. A hero.
What people had desired.
It was just a desire in the form of aspiration.
Did people want to live on their own, or in a
crowd... People can answer yes to either.
Anyway, back on track.
I read the books that she had read in the library.
Out of aspiration.
Or maybe I was jealous of her perfection.
The books were so high level, I barely understood
them.
But I kept reading.
We met and passed by one another hundreds of times
in the library.
We shared the same room, but we never had a
conversation.
That era continued, for several years.
And so.
Paradises never lasted forever.
An inevitable outcome, considering that even
humanity's first paradise ended in the same way.
The head of the Hasekura family had a sudden
decline.
That was the start of the disaster.
The elegant people of Hasekura had left.
The servants were left behind.
A rising individual and his relatives came in
to replace the Hasekura family.
They were rude people.
Men and women of all ages.
They all had characteristics of scavengers.
Not even three days had passed, and one of the
servants was assaulted.
An incident.
But we were in a box garden.
Closed space.
They created their own regulations.
The mansion being surrounded by massive amount of
land made it near extraterritorial.
It was surprising on what kind banquets were held
daily.
One of the rooms was originally used as a party
hall.
The Hasekura family loved having parties and often
used that room.
The rude people used it for a different "party".
There were no well-mannered conversations nor
quality meals.
It was filled with corruption and degeneration
instead.
...Several people must have become victims.
A few even went to the police.
But they never intervened.
Your only savior was your own capability.
...You had to think that way to not be angry.
Unless it caused you any harm, being upset from the
clumsiness of others or their lack of knowledge...
Meant that you have a piece of mind entrusted in
others.
But that was normal.
And being normal meant...
That you are in an area that had unfair and
incomplete rules due to the limit people had.
This wasn't an easy environment to live in...
Morals are a blur in such closed space.
Violence became more of a daily event.
One needed a firm mind to go against them.
A strong belief for yourself was needed.
Like hers...
Now then.
In this world inside the boxed garden, in this new
law, violence was tolerated.
A husband who escaped with his wife, was brought
back and murdered.
The body was buried in the yard.
The men guffawed and buried the body at the root of
the cherry blossom tree.
They were men with broken morals.
One day, a man came with his family.
A new character arrived.
He was sadistic and perverted.
To carry on the story easier, we will call him S.
S had his eyes on me.
I was forced to dress as a baby girl and take part
in their so called "parties".
But instead of a tea party, I was used to keep S
entertained.
Well, I've experienced a lot of things.
Soon after, S became more sadistic.
He brought a child.
His child.
He was the school bully at his school... Or so they
said.
It was only a moment, that he was overwhelmed with
the atmosphere. As soon as he looked at me he
sneered.
Arousal from the abnormal atmosphere.
He actively participated out of urge.
Like father like son. His talents showed.
It might also be because of his being precocious.
He became really into it.
I was everyone's laughing stock.
And for several weeks, while being laughed at...
I was attacked continuously.
*buzz*
Then there was a noise.

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"From here, it gets a little worse, okay?"

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

Her voice shook.

[Kiri]
"Wait, that wasn't bad?"

[Taichi]
"Not really."

[Kiri]
"Then...you..."

[Taichi]
"That incident, totally destroyed me."

[Kiri]
"No way..."

[Taichi]
"Well, never mind about me. Let's talk about Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"Y-yes."

She wiped her tears.

[Taichi]
"So then S's son is..."

No need to hide it any longer.

[Taichi]
"Yeah...it was Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"..."

She froze.
Along with her hands which trembled.
Of course, she wasn't relaxed.
She felt piteous and went pale.
She stared at me.

[Kiri]
"Wh-what are you saying...?"

I could only half-contain a smile.
She couldn't even keep her emotions in check.

[Taichi]
"Let's take a break."

I sat in a chair.

[Kiri]
"Uh, what?"

She asked in confusion.
I didn't talk at all.
...

[Taichi]
"Are you okay?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

Kiri slowly stood up.
She didn't have her weapon in hand.

[Taichi]
"Do you have any questions?"

[Kiri]
"So Yutaka...did...that to you?"

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."
"Well, it might have been the atmosphere. You know
how kids can't rebel against their father?"

She held her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Yutaka's unhappiness was having a father like that."

[Kiri]
"I know...I heard...Shinkawas...their rumors...but!"

[Taichi]
"Just as you said, there are too many evils in the
world."
"Yutaka was a victim."

[Kiri]
"But, I never heard about that while living with him.
I had no idea..."

[Taichi]
"The memory loss."

Those words immediately shut Kiri's mouth tight.
Kiri knew about Yutaka's memory loss.
Inside of Kiri, ambiguous threads
seemed to be sewn together.

[Taichi]
"And the reason he hurt his leg, I know why."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"It's because I was there."

[Kiri]
"So... Taichi...you knew about him...?"

[Taichi]
"Not at all."
"I didn't think Yutaka even survived... Also, I
didn't even remember his name."
"It was coincidence that I met him..."
"I was forced into a girl's outfit as well...
He didn't seem to realize."
"Then things happened, I was released...
After some twists and turns I ended coming here."
"But if you think about it, it's quite obvious."
"For Yutaka and I, there's no way such a thing would
mess us up."
"It was inevitable that we met."

[Kiri]
"I can't believe it."

[Taichi]
"I had only realized it after he and I had become
close."

[Kiri]
"So that's why...you killed him?"

[Taichi]
"I wasn't filled with such intent immediately."
"It was something that happened in the past."

[Kiri]
"If that's so, then why...?"

[Taichi]
"If he was regretting what he did, I thought of
letting him go."
"But he seemed so happy when we were hanging out."

[Kiri]
"...!!"
"That day...when you asked me that question...
If he was happy...?"

[Taichi]
"You remember well."

I laughed.

[Taichi]
"That's right. That's exactly what it meant."
"That's why I decided that Yutaka was happy."
"He wasn't filled with resentment."
"I just wanted to pick on it..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It was a beautiful day."
"As you saw, on the rooftop we were talking it out."

[Kiri]
"Ugh."

[Taichi]
"At that time, he asked me, 'What can I do to make
you forgive me?'"
"I had no will to condemn him."
"I just had one question for him..."
"And so I asked him."
"Hey, one question...why don't you die now?"
"That's what I asked."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Then... Yutaka actually committed suicide."

Kiri collapsed.
I wanted to approach her and whisper to her.
But I held it back.

[Taichi]
"There was no grudge."
"But for guys that happily attack others...
I couldn't allow that to happen."
"Yutaka was either of those...and I...really..."
"The fact there was no grudge...that alone is good...
at least I think so."
"If Yutaka was still here...I probably would have been
a better person."

[Kiri]
"Aaaahhhhhhhhh..."

She barely managed to force the tears out.

[Taichi]
"He became a good guy...but, I was too broken."
"No matter what front I put on...it's as you say,
I'm a monster, Kiri."
"That's why it's too bad."
"Because..."

But my heart didn't cry out.
I couldn't even cry.
I couldn't forgive myself.
No...
I decided not to forgive myself.

[Taichi]
"Sorry about that, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Waaaah, aaaaaah!"

[Taichi]
"Back in that abnormal atmosphere, the only way
Yutaka could keep his composure was by devouring
me."
"Then I ended up devouring him next..."
"I guess we ended up destroying each other,
in a way, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Er..."

Kiri came to hold me.
And I went to hold her as well.

[Kiri]
"I'm sorry..."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!"
"I'm sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Don't apologize. That's not what I asked for..."
"Please cry, for me then..."

She cried her heart out...
At home.
This was usually a lonely space, but today a blossom
had planted herself here.

[Taichi]
"Come on in."

[Kiri]
"S-sorry to bother you..."

After that, Kiri came to my house.

[Kiri]
"Whoa..."

My bedroom was adorned with my love for chaos.
Visitors were often surprised.

[Taichi]
"Have a seat."

[Kiri]
"...Where can I sit?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed her a rake.

[Kiri]
"...A rake?"

[Taichi]
"Make room for yourself."

[Kiri]
"..."

Better for her to handle herself.
Kiri sat down in the open space which she created
with the rake.

[Kiri]
"Is this really what men are like?"

[Taichi]
"Sit tight."

I went downstairs briefly and came back with a
tomato in hand.

[Taichi]
"Here, it's full of vitamins."

[Kiri]
"...Thanks."

She hesitated a moment before taking a bite out of
the tomato.

[Taichi]
"Just relax."

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"So...what did you want to talk about?"

[Kiri]
"It's about my atonement."

[Taichi]
"Atonement?"

I had expected something like that.

[Kiri]
"What Yutaka did, and all the things I have done to
you, including the murder attempted today."
"There are no police...so, I think you should decide."
"Mine and Yutaka's, both of ours."

[Taichi]
"So, you're saying I can ask you to do two things."

[Kiri]
"Actually, as much as you want..."
"The sin would never disappear though."

[Taichi]
"The sin itself is doesn't really matter, though."

Since, Yutaka and I punished each other.

[Taichi]
"Okay...then, just one request."

[Kiri]
"What would it be?"

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow, early in the morning, could you
come with me?"

[Kiri]
"Yes, will do."

[Taichi]
"Any questions?"

[Kiri]
"None, I'll do as you say."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."
"Well, we will be climbing the mountain."

[Kiri]
"The mountain?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, where we went camping...we're going there."

[Kiri]
"Okay, I'll be there."

Yeah!

[Kiri]
"Anything else?"

[Taichi]
"What...other than that?"

I hadn't thought of anything.
What should I do.

[Kiri]
"Anything is fine."

[Taichi]
"Then..."

I moved my lips on to hers.

[Kiri]
"...?!"

Making it deep and long would kill the mood.

[Taichi]
"Well then, thanks."

I moved away.

[Kiri]
"Uh...um...um...?"

[Taichi]
"Don't think it over too much."

[Kiri]
"B-b-but..."

[Taichi]
"It's fine! My dream came true! Yes! I'm so awesome.
Wow, I did it, yes!"

I calmed down.

[Taichi]
"I'm going to sleep. Go home."

I got in bed.

[Kiri]
"Taichi...?"

She grabbed my arm.

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow, come here by six and wake me up."

[Kiri]
"Then, I'll be here..."

[Taichi]
"Hey. I have my own reasons..."

[Kiri]
"You're such an idiot..."

[Taichi]
"Wha...?"

She approached me this time.
And then it was morning.
I opened my eyes.

[Taichi]
"Kiri...?"

But, she wasn't here.
If I remember correctly...last night...she...

[Kiri]
"Good morning, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...Good morning."

[Kiri]
"I was thinking about making breakfast..."

[Taichi]
"I see, there really isn't anything here..."

[Kiri]
"I found some potatoes."

[Taichi]
"What, you found something awesome like that?"

I vaguely remember if I did...

[Kiri]
"I tried steaming them."

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh."

I suddenly developed an appetite.

[Kiri]
"Here, eat it with salt."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, let's eat!"

A mountain of potatoes.

[Kiri]
"It tastes good."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, great. Cooked all the way through."

[Kiri]
"I wish we had butter...but there isn't any."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry you will be able to soon."

[Kiri]
"Really, why?"

[Taichi]
"Well...you just will."

[Kiri]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Whoa, I'm full!"

[Kiri]
"Glad you enjoyed it."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, gotta get ready!"

[Kiri]
"Oh...to go to the mountain."
"Let me pack the left overs."

[Taichi]
"Nah, you don't have to. You're fine."

[Kiri]
"Okay..."

[Taichi]
"Are you not gonna question me?"

[Kiri]
"Nope."

[Taichi]
"Don't be too anxious. Sin is just a concept."

[Kiri]
"If I say this, you might get angry but..."
"But I'm a bit happy now..."

[Taichi]
"Happy?"

[Kiri]
"The fact that you thought of Yutaka as a friend."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah..."

[Kiri]
"Both of you worked so hard at school."

[Taichi]
"Two people of one mind and body."

[Kiri]
"I guess so..."

[Taichi]
"Hmm...so with Yutaka gone...you became one heart
and two bodies with Miki."

[Kiri]
"Yes."
"Is that kind of cowardly...?"

[Taichi]
"Who cares...well, it's not like I'm any better."

[Kiri]
"That's not true."

[Taichi]
"Okay, time to climb a mountain! Let's go!"

[Kiri]
"Okay!"
"Oh yeah, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hmm?"

[Kiri]
"I was thinking of becoming, a servant of love."

[Taichi]
"Psh!"

I spat in surprise.

[Taichi]
"Have you gone insane, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"I need to set my matters straight, right?"
"I mean, that's what you say all the time."
"I don't think you object."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, there is. That was a joke."

[Kiri]
"I'm not used to doing it, so please..."

[Taichi]
"Don't ask me to!"

[Kiri]
"Ahah!"

[Taichi]
"Are you mocking me?"

[Kiri]
"No, don't be absurd."

[Taichi]
"Phew...once I calm down, then I'll do wonders to
you."

[Kiri]
"Go ahead!"

[Taichi]
"I'll flip up your skirt!"

[Kiri]
"Go ahead!"

[Taichi]
"I'm about to give you a full course of mischief!"

[Kiri]
"Go ahead!"

[Taichi]
"Okay then, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Whatever you want!"
"You're don't want to...?"

[Taichi]
"It's not that I don't want to... I probably shouldn't."

[Kiri]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"I mean, if I were to, another would be involved."

[Kiri]
"You mean Youko?"
"Um, what's your relationship with her?"

[Taichi]
"She's stalking me."

[Kiri]
"Does that bother you?"

[Taichi]
"It does...I want to chase her away."

[Kiri]
"How is that...?"

[Taichi]
"What do you mean?"

[Kiri]
"I mean, I can chase her away."

[Taichi]
"You're asking for a challenge...you would never
stand a chance against her."

[Kiri]
"I could train...learn various things."

[Taichi]
"Impossible...her skills as a stalker are on a
different level."

[Kiri]
"As a servant of love, I will fight her with the
power of love."

[Taichi]
"But your so timid and weak...I think it would be
difficult."

[Kiri]
"Wha--...that's not true."

[Taichi]
"I mean, the power of love you say is also a way of
depending on me, you know?"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"It's fine, but you shouldn't depend on me, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Well, what can I do...where do I fit in?"

[Taichi]
"Where you fit in, I have a clue."
"We're going there right now."

[Kiri]
"Here?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, we've arrived."

[Kiri]
"The shrine, right?"

[Taichi]
"Well, that's not that important. Come over here."

[Kiri]
"There's nothing here though?"

[Taichi]
"Put this in your pocket."

[Kiri]
"The radio? Okay..."

[Taichi]
"Okay, Kiri, I'll keep an eye out, so could you keep
walking straight?"

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Just walk straight."

[Kiri]
"Okay..."

[Taichi]
"Slowly. I will tell you when to stop."

[Kiri]
"Okay?"
"Slowly...slowly..."

[Taichi]
"Uhh...just a little more."

[Kiri]
"A little more..."

[Taichi]
"A little to the right!"

[Kiri]
"This way?"

[Taichi]
"Right, exactly."
"Very slowly now. 1/2 speed."

[Kiri]
"Huh? I don't know...slowly...right?"

[Taichi]
"Stop there."

[Kiri]
"Okay!"

All right. Perfect position.

[Kiri]
"?"

Now if I can just switch my eyes...

[Taichi]
"Okay, Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Where you fit in."

[Kiri]
"What? I can't hear you!"

[Taichi]
"Where you fit it. How to find it."

[Kiri]
"Where I fit in?"

[Taichi]
"We talked about how there is conflict within the
heart, right?"

[Kiri]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Because you're delicate and too sharp... You notice
more things than a regular person."
"And with those eyes, you can find who's important
to you."

[Kiri]
"Hahah, thank you!"
"But, the important person, is already here!"

[Taichi]
"No, you will find someone better..."
"And also, I'll send back Miki later too."

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Hard things, unreasonable things, evil within..."
"There will also be happy and sad things to come..."
"Compared to nothing, a world with people is
better."
"You know that, right?"
"So, hang in there."

[Kiri]
"Taichi, what are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"This is the last time I'll see you."
"The memories I got, I want to thank you for it."

[Kiri]
"I really don't understand what you're saying..."

[Taichi]
"Good luck over there!"

I gave a salute.
Kiri's face quickly became anxious.

[Kiri]
"What...do you mean..."
"What are you trying to do?!"

Before she could run towards me...
The crimson...
Then.
*blink*
I "observed" it.
I closed my eyes...and opened them.

[Kiri]
"What are you trying to do?"
"Huh...?"
"Taichi? Where are you?"
"Taichi! Taichi!"
"Where, where are you?"
"The town? What?"
"People are here again?"
"The radio works?"
"It works?"
"Is this?"
"Taichi! Taichi! Taichi! Taichi! Taichi!"
"Oh! Taichi!"
"Are you not here?"
"No...why?"
"Why... Why are you not here..."
"It doesn't make sense at all..."
"Ahhhh!"
"Ahhhh!"
"Wh...wha...why? Whyyyyyyyyyyyy!!"

[Taichi]
"..."
"This is how it was supposed to be."
"Hey Kiri!"

I called out to her, just in case.
But of course, there was no response.

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

I'm the only one who could observe it.
In these many worlds, they overlapped on the same
axis.
That's why Kiri was still nearby.
We just couldn't perceive each other.
Though we lived in the same world.
We just couldn't connect anymore.
For the moment I observed it, she was back to reality.
No...
All possibilities began on the same axis.
It just depended on who saw it or not.
Well then...
I would wait again for the time.
I went back to camp and entered the tent.
It was time.
When I woke up...
See you next week...
