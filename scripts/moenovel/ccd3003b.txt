[Kiri]
"We never had friends in our old school.
Neither my brother nor I."
"Even my friends have betrayed me, too... I couldn't
trust anyone anymore..."
"Even though we've hurt no one, they all hurt us."

[Taichi]
"But this is a world where beasts that protect
themselves get shot by guns."

[Kiri]
"...But we're humans."

...

[Kiri]
"I'm..."
"This whole world...frightens me...so much..."

[Taichi]
"What scares you about it?"

[Kiri]
"The evil..."
"The evil within people..."

...

[Kiri]
"I thought if humans disappeared, they'd just
vanish... Since there's nothing in this world."
"The whole world is filled with nothing, so it's
rare when there's something!"
"I always think about getting washed away by this
nothingness..."

[Taichi]
"Are you talking about, human extinction like in
science fiction?"

[Kiri]
"No, not like that... Not something that has a
reason..."
"It's like you wake up and everything was a dream."
"This whole world is just people hating each other...
It's terrifying..."
"But when I think, someday...everything
vanishes...and in this small world...I'm the only
one left..."
"I...I..."

...

[Taichi]
"Each person has their own definition of happiness."

[Kiri]
"...I don't like it."
"It may not be evil within her, but I don't like it."
"I mean...people are here...and each one seems like
they're on their own prison island."
"I don't like it."

...
It was as if...
Kiri wanted someone to care for her...
Like she was screaming for it.

[Taichi]
"..."

I opened my eyes.
I was having a dream.
A very familiar dream.
Talking about humanity's evils with Kiri.
In thinking about it, I still had no idea how it was
that Kiri and I had come to be rejected by
this world.
I wondered about that often.
People ultimately lived for themselves.
People only interacted with each other for their own
selfish reasons.
Such irony.
It was just about time.

[Taichi]
"I'd better get going."

Kiri was on the rooftop.
I could see the world around us.
Even though I was conscious, I was pulled back into
a memory of the past.
It was the end of summer, but I could still hear the
cicadas.
Kiri was all alone on the rooftop.
At that time, I was still someone Kiri understood.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Taichi...?"
"Yutaka...fell from here..."

It was a week after Yutaka's suicide.
I asked Kiri, who was confronting her delayed grief,
that old question.

[Taichi]
"Hey Kiri... Do you think Yutaka was happy?"

[Kiri]
"He...always had a hard time."

[Taichi]
"Did he really always have a hard time?"
"Were there no moments of happiness?"

[Kiri]
"That's..."

I was at a loss as well.
For how to deal with Kiri...

[Taichi]
"You're free to cry."
"At least until the summer ends."

[Kiri]
"Waaaaahhhhhhh!"

She looked down, grasped the bottom of my shirt,
and cried out.

[Kiri]
"My brother... Yutaka... He's gone... Gone..."

She sobbed.

[Taichi]
"..."

Kiri and Yutaka were like blood siblings.
Like they were each other's missing half.
Kiri had lost that half of herself, a piece
which held her together.
And for Yutaka, I was...

[Taichi]
"Kiri, are you lonely?"

I took Kiri in my arms without thinking about it.

[Taichi]
"You're lonely...right?"

[Kiri]
"Taichi...?"

Was Yutaka happy or not?
Up until his last moments...
He must have been smiling.
I was sure he must have been smiling.

[Taichi]
"I think...he was happy. He had you, and forgot all
of his pain."
"I think he died happy."

He must have been smiling.
I brought my face closer to Kiri's.

[Kiri]
"Hmm...?"

I stole a kiss from her.
Was Yutaka happy?
He must have been smiling.
I must've been smiling.
Kiri was awash in fear.

[Kiri]
"Ah...?!"

I forcibly took the trembling Kiri in my arms, and
took the breath from her mouth as well.

[Kiri]
"Hmmnn...no...I can't..."

As my hand reached for her skirt, Kiri finally
understood my true intentions.

[Kiri]
"Nnnnn?"

She shoved me away with all her strength.

[Kiri]
"Y-you're..."

I must've been smiling.

[Kiri]
"...!!"

Next thing I know, Kiri was gone.
Kiri neglected me since.
She stopped coming to club.
Miki tried to bring her forcefully, but she
avoided me.
We no longer talked, and we became distant.
And that was what happened...

[Taichi]
"..."

Kiri's prediction had suddenly come true.
Humans were such fragile things.
Well then...

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

I called out softly.
If it caught Kiri by surprise, she didn't show it.
She slowly turned around.

[Kiri]
"With this world where people are gone..."
"All the bad doings were gone... But that meant
the world also became less dense..."
"And still, with all that given, you haven't
changed."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"...I was thinking of telling you before."
"Why is it that you're alive?"

"Hey, one question...why don't you die now?"
Everything piled up.
The past, the present.
Together.
It was like the blade I threw came back straight at
me.
It was ironic.

[Kiri]
"Do you think you have the right to live?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"You're...evil."

It was an accurate thing to say.

[Kiri]
"You're not human, or even look like one. You're
mimicking one...like an insect."
"You imitate, disguise yourself as a human, then
hunt us down."
"You just hurt humans. You'll never be compatible
with us."
"I always wondered why your adaptation score was
80\p, but now it's as clear as day. There's literally
only 20\p human in you."

She was letting it all out.
All the emotions Kiri Sakura was holding back,
now sprung out into a new, shimmering image.
She wanted to hurt me with words as sharp as a
knife.
I thought she only had a dull sword...
But now it seems they'd been her secret weapon!

[Kiri]
"You're a monster."
"The worst part is...is that even though you're a
monster, you can't devote yourself to it."
"Do you think people will be sympathetic to you as a
monster and that you'll be able to live peacefully
with us? That you can live along with us?"
"That's not possible."
"In this world, with so little kindness, there's none
left for you. No...there should be none for you."
"It's just like how no host has love for the parasites
eating up its body."
"You're always looking for prey as a sacrifice to
yourself. I know this. You just did well in hiding
your intentions."
"But now, with the world like this, with no people,
you don't have to hold it back anymore."
"There's no more need for you to pretend to be
human."
"You love hurting others, and you always look for
a chance to do that to us. You don't do it right
away, you just bide your time and play with us."
"You're not human, and you're not a monster."
"So what are you? You're nothing, and you should
disappear from this world. That's what I think."
"The dead souls of all the malignant people in the
world combined hold much more value than your life."
"So, here are two things to make you wake up."
"First, even if you think you can be a human by
spending time with us, you're wrong. You can't.
That's a blasphemous thinking."
"I know because I've never seen a monster like you."
"Second, don't think you can do whatever you want
with us."
"If you come close to thinking that you can use
one of us as some kind of sacrifice..."

She spoke those final words slowly and deliberately.

[Kiri]
"I'll shoot you dead."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"I won't hand Miki over to you..."
"I won't let you hurt her!"

She stormed past me with determined steps.
The door behind me creaked and closed.
I was all alone.

[Taichi]
"A monster, huh...?"

Kiri's words echoed in my mind as I mulled
them over.
It wasn't as if I didn't know them to be true before.
Still, they struck hard...
She did exactly what the journals had recorded.
I followed her.
I was pretty sure she went this way.
I continued straight ahead, into the grove.
The one thing I had doubt in was...
Youko.
Would events follow their pre-established pattern
this time too?
If Youko didn't act this time...
Did that mean that the gap between Kiri and I
had been filled?
And if it wasn't filled, then what...
I held on to these questions as I continued to the
established spot.
My vision suddenly adjusted.
There was a brightness in the night.

[Kiri]
"Hyaaa!"

I heard Kiri shriek.

[Taichi]
"Youko, stop!"

[Youko]
"..."

She wasn't startled by me yelling out to her.
Perhaps she knew as well.

[Kiri]
"Grrr..."

Kiri moved the moment she saw an opportunity.
Youko quickly threw a stone at her.

[Kiri]
"Ahh!"

Kiri was caught off guard and wasn't ready for the
blow.
The stone struck her cleanly in the calf.

[Kiri]
"Ah!"

Kiri fell hard into a cowering position.
She held her leg and clenched her teeth.
It must have hurt badly.

[Youko]
"..."

Youko tucked a second stone into the belt in
her hand.
She started to swing the belt in a circle, and the
makeshift sling became a blur of motion.

[Kiri]
"W-wait..."

Kiri's face was pale.

[Kiri]
"Wh-what are you...doing?"

[Youko]
"You were going to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"?!"

[Youko]
"You were practicing how you'd kill him."

[Kiri]
"I-is that why...you're trying to kill me?"

[Youko]
"..."

Was that her honest intent?
There was no time to think.
There was only one recorded outcome.

[Kiri]
"Aagghh..."

The sling continued to spin in Youko's hand.
Its sharp whistling sound cut the air.
Seeing and hearing the destructive force before her,
Kiri was frozen in fear.
This would be the instrument of her death.
Kiri looked as if she couldn't believe it.
The kinetic energy steadily built up before her eyes.

[Kiri]
"S-stop..."

Kiri held her crossbow in front of her face
defensively, and began to weep.
Kiri was at her limit.

[Taichi]
"No more."

I stood in front of Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

The sling's spinning slowed.

[Youko]
"If I let her live, you're putting yourself in more
danger, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"That's fine with me."
"All right?"

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Let her do what she wants."

[Youko]
"I can't..."

[Taichi]
"Youko."

I called her name strongly.
But she showed no signs of relenting.
Even so, was she really going to kill Kiri?
I didn't know.

[Youko]
"I'll remove her."

[Taichi]
"You don't have to."

[Youko]
"Move."

[Taichi]
"I won't."

Behind me, Kiri was catching her breath
and watching intently.
She was torn between relief at her salvation
and that salvation being by my hands.

[Youko]
"But..."

She looked completely at a loss.

[Taichi]
"I won't have you killing anyone for my sake."
"If you want to kill someone, find your own reason."

She flinched at the remark.
Perhaps this was all an act.

[Youko]
"But... I did this...for you, Taichi..."

For me.
She'd use my name to kill Kiri.
She did it without thinking that it would hurt me.

[Taichi]
"You always say that. Don't use my feelings as your
excuse."
"Even if there's trouble..."

Youko's wrist suddenly turned.

[Taichi]
"..."

Kiri's head was peeking out from behind me,
listening to the conversation.
I thrust my palm in front of her face.
I worried the stone might strike me or Kiri, but
instead it smashed into a tree trunk behind us.

[Kiri]
"Aaah?!"

[Taichi]
"..."

She missed...
It was an act after all.
Had she decided to cooperate?
But why?
Youko's face was the one to turn pale this time.

[Youko]
"Ah... I'm sorry... Forgive me..."

In an instant, things fell into chaos.
And yet things were progressing just as expected.

[Taichi]
"You betrayed me."

[Youko]
"But...I... Because..."

[Taichi]
"You tried to hit her while we were talking."
"Again..."

Her shoulders seemed to shudder.

[Taichi]
"You say I'm important. That you love me.
That you want what's best."
"But now you've betrayed me..."
"Again."

[Youko]
"No, I wanted to...make sure you're safe..."

She looked flustered.
She was definitely putting on an act...
Pretty convincingly, too.
We had played our roles out to their fullest.
All right then, let's see your best performance.
I smiled on the inside.

[Taichi]
"I don't wanna hear any more!"

Youko recoiled in fear, like a little girl
being bullied.
...
She then turned and left.
I snatched away Kiri's weapon, and her will to
resist came with it.

[Taichi]
"..."

From behind me, I could practically feel the tension
in the air...
And I noticed it slowly charging with rage...

[Taichi]
"How's your leg?"

[Kiri]
"Why do you care?"

Kiri was confused and angry as to why I saved her.
Her emotions were mixed, and she was holding back
her urge to lash out.
Her stifled voice told the tale.

[Kiri]
"Why...did you...help me?"

[Taichi]
"I...don't really know why..."
"I just wanted to help, so I did... Not much of a
reason, I suppose..."

[Kiri]
"Stop screwing around."

[Taichi]
"I'm not screwing around..."
"I see. You can't stand it."
"To be saved by someone you hate..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Were you really planning to kill me?"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Yowch... Okay then."

[Kiri]
"You're too dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Dangerous?"

[Kiri]
"You toy with others for your own amusement."
"You'll never change, if we let you be like this."

Her voice began to rise suddenly.
But just as quickly, her tone dropped.

[Kiri]
"I thought it might be fun, killing someone."

The air was still around us.
That stillness was filled with hatred.
The hatred that Kiri was spewing out.

[Taichi]
"No more killing."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"I don't want any more killing."

[Kiri]
"What do you...?"

[Taichi]
"I know what I am, Kiri."
"But I don't want any more destruction."
"I don't want those memories, either."
"That's why I fight."
"But my fight is with myself."

[Kiri]
"..."
"Why...?"
"Why did you save me?"

She asked again.

[Kiri]
"You should have let me die."
"You know that I see you as the enemy.
You know that..."
"You profit nothing from helping me."

[Taichi]
"'Profit'..."
"You're alive, and you have an effect on me...
That's 'profit' enough for me."
"Remember what you said before?"

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"And besides, if you died, it would destroy Miki."
"That's not what you want, right?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

Okay.
Kiri had settled down.
I'd best not try making any easy jokes unnecessarily.

[Taichi]
"Let's leave it at that. Even if you can't accept it
so easily."
"Man, what a throw..."

The stone that Youko slung was stuck in a tree.
It was completely embedded in the trunk.

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"All right, let's head back."

[Kiri]
"Taichi Kurosu... I don't understand you at all
anymore."

[Taichi]
"I see."

She was simply deceiving herself.
For her own peace of mind.
Kiri had an enduring expectation for people
to fit the mold she had imagined for them.

[Taichi]
"What Youko said before... I think she was serious."

[Kiri]
"Hm?"

She wiped her mouth as a frown came over it.

[Taichi]
"No more weapons. It's better if we don't carry them
around."
"If you do, I'm sure she really will try to kill
you."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri's shoulders trembled...
From fear.

[Taichi]
"As long as I'm around, you should be all right."
"It would be best if you stopped treating me as an
enemy."

[Kiri]
"Not...an enemy?"

[Taichi]
"So we can be together."

[Kiri]
"That's..."

[Taichi]
"Don't like it? Well, it's the only choice you have.
I'm gonna be following you around anyhow."

[Kiri]
"Can I ask you something?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"About Yutaka."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, that..."
"Can we talk about that later?"

[Kiri]
"Why? Would it be so terrible to talk about it now?"

[Taichi]
"Let's talk about it when you're feeling better."

[Kiri]
"But I'm-"

[Taichi]
"Not looking so well right now."

We fell silent for a moment.

[Kiri]
"Um...that guerilla lodge last week...
Is that...?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... Yeah, I got bored of it."
"Forcing a convenient scenario, getting all seven
members together, coaxing and lying to everyone..."
"And then before I knew it, I stopped putting in the
effort."

I couldn't help but laugh.
Kiri cast her gaze at me, with a look in her eyes
as if she were seeing something new and different.

[Taichi]
"I must have been in a really bad mood
to withdraw so suddenly."

[Kiri]
"You planned the whole camping thing out, didn't
you?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I did."

[Kiri]
"To try and hurt everyone more?"

[Taichi]
"No."
"I just...wanted things to go back to the way they
were."

[Kiri]
"I can't trust you..."

[Taichi]
"I know..."

[Kiri]
"But I'll put aside my doubt for now."

[Taichi]
"Okay...thanks."
"So, that injury..."

[Kiri]
"Ah, I'm fine... Don't touch it!"

[Taichi]
"We won't know for sure unless I do though."

Her calf.
It was swollen.

[Taichi]
"Internal bleeding. Youko knew what she was doing."
"It'll hurt to walk, but it shouldn't be a problem."
"What else?"

[Kiri]
"My shoulders..."

[Taichi]
"Show me."

[Kiri]
"?!"
"Y-you really are a monster..."

She hugged her shoulders and backed away.

[Taichi]
"Hey, I was joking! Don't actually do it."

[Kiri]
"You always do this when...you sexually harass Miki
and the others."

[Taichi]
"Do you think that Miki really means it when she
says no?"
"She says 'no,' but then laughs and hits me, right?"

[Kiri]
"Miki does that?"

[Taichi]
"And I don't try to force her either."
"We adjust our boundaries as we connect.
That's how humans interact, am I wrong?"

[Kiri]
"You really have a funny way of describing sexual
harassment."

[Taichi]
"You just take it all so seriously."
"I'm going to touch your shoulders."

[Kiri]
"Eh? Ah!"

Even rubbing them lightly, she was in pain.

[Taichi]
"It seems I hit a sore spot..."
"How much does it hurt?"

[Kiri]
"I can't really...move my arm..."

[Taichi]
"Lift it up to your head."

She abided.

[Taichi]
"Your bones seem fine."

[Kiri]
"You're putting too much pressure on them."

[Taichi]
"No, I'm not."

[Kiri]
"Guys always say they're not strong... But even
scrawny Shima could lift a TV."

[Taichi]
"He used to be in the basketball club... Even though
he can't run, he still kept the muscles."
"It should be fine if we put a compress on it."

[Kiri]
"I understand..."

[Taichi]
"So, shall we head back?"

I stood up.

[Taichi]
"Come on, let's go."

She reluctantly followed me.

[Kiri]
"Ow!"

[Taichi]
"So it does hurt..."

[Kiri]
"Please go on ahead. I can make it on my own."

[Taichi]
"Here, hop on."

I offered my back.

[Kiri]
"I-I'm all right."

[Taichi]
"Hurry."

[Kiri]
"I said I'm all right!"

[Taichi]
"Youko's probably still here, did you forget?"

[Kiri]
"Even so..."

[Taichi]
"Okay. This is an order from your superior.
Get on my back, now."

[Kiri]
"Y-you're terrible."

[Taichi]
"Hurry up!"

Kiri unwillingly complied.
I hoisted Kiri up and onto my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"I'll carry you back to your house."

[Kiri]
"That's not possible... Aren't I too heavy?"

[Taichi]
"You, heavy? Are you kidding me?"

She was much lighter than I anticipated.
I started walking.
My footsteps on the vegetation made sharp crunching
noises.

[Taichi]
"Nice night out, huh?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"So it's already Friday."

Only three days until the world would reset.
I had so much to do.
I saw Kiri at the school entrance.
She was just standing there, for some reason.
As if she were trying to make herself clearly seen.
Perhaps I should call out to her.

[Taichi]
"How are your injuries?"

[Kiri]
"They're fine. They just hurt a little."

[Taichi]
"You should be resting at home."

[Kiri]
"No, I'm not hurt that badly."

[Taichi]
"Where's Miki?"

[Kiri]
"It doesn't look like she's coming today..."
"She must be nervous."

With her experience reset to zero, Miki was back to
being fragile again.
Or rather, Miki was Miki again.
Such was the state of disappearing humanity...

[Taichi]
"She seems to be in pretty low spirits..."

[Kiri]
"Yeah... She's been trying so hard
at so many things."

[Taichi]
"It's hot today."

I looked up at the sky.

[Taichi]
"I could go for a swim in the sea right now."
"We went last year. Do you remember?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"That was fun. Not so much for Miki, though."

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

The sea.
We didn't go this year.
Even if I were to go by myself now, it'd do no good.
Only three days left.
Even with the most positive outlook, how could I get
anything done like this?
I wanted something wholesome.
So badly.

[Taichi]
"Why don't we go to the beach?"

[Kiri]
"Huh...? To the beach?"

[Taichi]
"Let's invite Miki too. It'd be the three of us."

[Kiri]
"Miki too..."

[Taichi]
"Okay then, let's go!"

[Kiri]
"J-just like that...?"

I took her hand in mine.

[Kiri]
"Eek?"

[Taichi]
"Let's go get Miki!"

[Kiri]
"But I don't have a swimsuit!"

[Taichi]
"The general store near Miki's apartment building
should have some!"

[Kiri]
"What about what I want?"

[Taichi]
"Hey, I saved your life, you owe me at least one
date!"

[Kiri]
"A d-date?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, a date with a flower in each hand."

[Kiri]
"Th-that's..."

[Taichi]
"It's all right, it's all right, let's GO!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, wait, Taichi..."

I was being a little forceful with her.
So then...
We dragged the downtrodden, neurotic Miki out
of her apartment.
I gathered the essentials from Atomic Shop...
Packed the car...
And headed to the ocean.
...

[Taichi]
"All right, now THIS is an ocean!"

I struck a proud pose.

[Taichi]
"Now then!"

[Miki]
"Heh..."

[Kiri]
"Ngh..."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, so nice, so nice!"

Though we were still quite young and innocent,
our bodies were obviously blossoming.

[Miki]
"I feel like...we're being watched."

[Kiri]
"I feel it too..."

[Miki]
"Whatever it is, you'll protect me, right?"

[Kiri]
"I don't think I can..."

I struck a number of body-building poses,
despite my withered appearance.

[Taichi]
"Let's get to it!"

...

[Miki]
"Ohh-ohh, Kiri, the ball, the ball!"

[Kiri]
"I can't I can't, I'm telling you I can't!"

[Taichi]
"Hah, your hair's gonna be soaked
when I'm done with ya!"

[Kiri]
"No, don't!"

[Miki]
"Ahh, the ball's falling!"

[Kiri]
"I can't!"

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, now's our chance... Hah!"

[Miki]
"Whoa, nice!"

[Taichi]
"Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa!"
"Wha-wha-wha?!"

[Kiri]
"Heh..."

[Miki]
"Ahahaha you can't keep on your feet, Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"Awww, I lost it..."
"Your serve, then."

[Miki]
"All right, heads up! Graahh!"

[Taichi]
"Incoming!"

[Miki]
"Ah, nice shot!"

[Kiri]
"I've got it...here!"

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, not bad!"

[Kiri]
"It's 2-on-1, we can't lose!"

[Taichi]
"This is the perfect receive..."

[Miki]
"Sniper!"

[Taichi]
"Bang!"

[Miki]
"Ah, got hit!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, how much damage was that?"

[Kiri]
"I have three points left."

[Taichi]
"Heheh, watch out now."

[Kiri]
"All right, my serve."

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, bring it on!"

[Miki]
"Pew!"

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, no attacks until after service!"

[Miki]
"Huh? I didn't attack, I was just making noises!"

[Taichi]
"You're playing dirty!"
"All right, received! Combat starts!"

[Miki]
"Phwoop!"

[Taichi]
"Damn, missed!"

[Kiri]
"Take this!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, they've caught me out..."

[Miki]
"Kiri, let's hit him with the combo!"

[Kiri]
"Okay!"

[Taichi]
"Wha-wha-wha... What now?!"

[Miki]
"Agghh, they all missed!"

[Kiri]
"He's like a monkey..."

[Taichi]
"All right, my turn! Hey hey, it's not your attack
once I receive!"

[Miki]
"Ah, so sorry!"

[Taichi]
"Now that I have the ball, it's my turn to attack
until you catch my serve! Got it yet?! Wooo, you're
gonna!"

[Kiri]
"Eek, wait Taichi! Using water attacks like that is
against the rules!"

[Taichi]
"Hmph... I'm running on fumes...already?"

[Miki]
"Hoh-hoh-hohh, we've still got plenty left,
since we're fighting as a team!"

[Taichi]
"I know, I agreed to that handicap in the first
place...!"
"Even if I can't attack, I can still win with purely
volleyball-based play!"

[Miki]
"Say what...?"

[Kiri]
"He plays so tough..."

[Miki]
"Yeah, very forceful. Like always."

[Kiri]
"But he's all hot air."

[Miki]
"Yeah, and such a blow-hard."

[Taichi]
"Hey whoa, don't bad-mouth someone when they're
right in front of you!"

[Miki]
"Here's our chance, take the shot!"

[Kiri]
"Roger!"

[Taichi]
"Wah!"

[Miki]
"Team Flowers wins!"

[Kiri]
"All right!"

We played our beach volleyball/survival game
and enjoyed the rest of the day together.
