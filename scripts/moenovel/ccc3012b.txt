I wasn't sure what I was doing but...
It wasn't clever to continue on recklessly.
But I was more concerned about what was giving
me the chills.
Perhaps...there was an alien in the house?

[Taichi]
"Heheheh..."

I was a weak contemporary boy who didn't even have 
a flamethrower.
I didn't have a weapon to fight back if I ran into
an alien.
But!
I took a fighting stance.
Heck, I didn't need a weapon.
All I needed were my fists.

[Taichi]
"The time has come to use it in an actual fight."

Karade required perseverance and endurance.
It's a slanderous variant of Karate.
Many of our comrades had gone off the path.
Now that it seemed humans were going to be wiped
out, it was time to realize my long-cherished hope.

[Taichi]
My fists were howling for a fight.

I headed downstairs, spoke like a fighter to
himself.
No one there.
That intense chill I felt...
It was from someone not to underestimate.
Not in...the toilet.
Not in...the bath.

[Taichi]
"Hm..."

Not in...the first floor storage area.
Not in...Mutsumi's room.
Ah, it was so dusty.
I'll clean that later...
I'm sorry Mutsumi.
Bowed and left.
I wondered where else.
There was one room left.

[Taichi]
"Could it be..."

Returned to the second floor.
Next to...my room.
Youko's room.
I put my hands on the knob.
It's been a while since I was last here.
Not since Youko left the house.
I opened the door slowly.
Began swinging as soon as I entered the room!

[Taichi]
"Hiyah! Yah! Hiyah!"

Dust flew everywhere.

[Taichi]
"..."

No one was around.

[Taichi]
"What am I doing..."

How embarrassing.
I left the room.
I was thirsty from flailing in the dust.
When I returned to the living room, Sakuraba was
eating a tomato and drinking some of the water
reserves.
*New Real Time Monologue technique in use.

[Taichi]
"Hiiiiiiyaaaaah!!"

[Sakuraba]
"Oof."

Sakuraba didn't let go of the tomato even when he
fell.

[Taichi]
"What're you doing?"

[Sakuraba]
"Listen."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Sakuraba]
"I got tired of curry rolls."

[Taichi]
"You know what...?"

[Sakuraba]
"Well, I came to your place and you had tomatoes."

[Taichi]
"Yeah so, why are you in my house?"

[Sakuraba]
"I told Tomoki that I wasn't going to eat anymore."

[Taichi]
"Wh-why?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because I'm done with curry rolls."

Such an ad hoc life he had.

[Sakuraba]
"So meaning, it's gonna be troublesome from today."

[Taichi]
"Why?!"

[Sakuraba]
"For the reason I told just told you, I will be
moving here."

[Taichi]
"What in the world are you talking about?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Please lend me a room."

I couldn't believe this guy!
This is weird.
Weirder than weird!!!

[Taichi]
"Y-you...want to leave that big home of yours and
live here?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah. It's big but there's no food."

[Taichi]
"Alright..."

He was a hopeless Mama's boy, what could I do?

[Taichi]
"So you want me to show you around?"

[Sakuraba]
"Please."

I led him to the toilet.

[Taichi]
"Here's your room."

[Sakuraba]
"It's small."

[Taichi]
"It's just an eight-mat room."
"This is where commoners live."
"Isn't your big room at home better than this?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's about 16 mats, so twice the size of this room."

[Taichi]
"16?!"

Did he live in a castle?!

[Sakuraba]
"Well it felt twice the size, but it was actually
quite small."

[Taichi]
"Come on."

Maybe this guy wasn't a primate.

[Sakuraba]
"On my 12th birthday, Daddy gave me the sunniest
room!"

Daddy?!
He definitely came from a weird home...
I've gotta figure him out.

[Taichi]
"Daddy's boy... How much did you get for your
allowance?"

I was calling him weird names when I noticed.
I was getting 20,000 yen a month thanks to the
resourceful Mutsumi.
Not including food money.
It was pretty standard.
I was pretty proud.

[Sakuraba]
"I don't get that much."

So he said.

[Sakuraba]
"Only 500,000."

[Taichi]
"Say what?!"

I spun and collapsed.

[Taichi]
"R-really?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Are you a celebrity's son or something?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Why are you upset?"
"First of all, I'm not famous."
"I'm just me."

[Taichi]
"Could you say that after you've contemplated
about the meaning of life?"

500,000 yen, huh?
So abnormal.
Hang on.

[Taichi]
"So what if I say I need 500,000 up front for the
room charge?"

Sakuraba tilted his head.

[Sakuraba]
"I don't have that much."

[Taichi]
"All right, give me what you have on you."

[Sakuraba]
"All I've got is change."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, yeah."

He took out his wallet.
I took it from him.
Yeah, only change.
The coins jingled.
I was relieved.
The jealousy died down.

[Taichi]
"Hahah, even you're broke sometimes, daddy's boy."

Sakuraba gave a friendly laugh.

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah well, even the rich have times like that."
"Just like how commoner's rooms are like this."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Sakuraba]
"Hahah."

We both laughed hard.
We shook hands.
I made a friend.

[Taichi]
"It doesn't make sense to take money at this point."

[Sakuraba]
"That's true."

[Taichi]
"Besides, I've always lent you change."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay, I'll repay you."

[Taichi]
"What's the point?"

[Sakuraba]
"I should return what I borrowed."

[Taichi]
"You're too honest. Whatever, you can pay me back."

We chuckled silently.
I opened his wallet.
As expected there were no bills.
There were fifteen 100,000 yen gold pieces.

[Taichi]
"Mr. Money Bags!"

I felt light headed.

[Sakuraba]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Whooooaaaa."

I writhed like a worm.
What's up with this wallet?!
I've never seen anything like it.
After further inspection, it wasn't just gold pieces.
Eight 100,000 yen gold coins
commemorating Emperor Showa.
Seven 100,000 yen gold coins
commemorating the enthronement.
Two 50,000 yen gold coins
commemorating the crown prince's wedding.
Four 50,000 yen gold coins
commemorating an exhibition in Osaka.
Three 50,000 yen gold coins
commemorating another royal wedding.
That was it.

[Taichi]
"This is ridiculous!"

[Sakuraba]
"I couldn't use those for shopping."

[Taichi]
"Of course you can't!"

This guy... He wasn't worried about money at all.
Did he not consider 100,000 yen a lot at all?
At all? At all???

[Taichi]
"Huh?!"

If only I demanded gold coins before the end of
humanity...

[Taichi]
"Waah waah waah!"

[Sakuraba]
"Why're you crying?"

[Taichi]
"Waaaaaaaaah!"

God was so cruel!
I had nothing but remorse.

[Taichi]
"That's it...just go to bed..."

[Sakuraba]
"Okay, thanks again."

Sakuraba closed himself in the toilet.

[Taichi]
"Sure..."

I was tired.
But I didn't let him get to me.
He'll just sleep it off and go somewhere again.
Because he's a wanderlust.
The tomatoes were devoured.
I ate the last piece for dinner.
I felt a presence behind me.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba? You in the mood to move out this
soon?"

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Youko?"

She was standing in the living room.

[Taichi]
"What do you want at this hour?"

I told her not to come here anymore.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

Something was different.

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

Youko seemed...like her old self...

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

She approached.

[Taichi]
"W-wait..."

She got down.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

She embraced me.

[Taichi]
"Hmm??"

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

I didn't get it.

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

She suddenly pulled away.

[Youko]
"You've got tomato on your mouth..."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

She brought her head to mine.
She lightly licked the sides of my mouth.
And continued to my lips...

[Taichi]
"Wait."

Before I could pull away she pulled on my
shoulders.

[Youko]
"Taichi...Taichi..."

So unusual.
Being this vulnerable.
Heat surged in my abdomen.
I always reacted to the weakness of strong girls.

[Taichi]
"No!"

[Youko]
"But..."

[Taichi]
"We can't be anything more than siblings
in this house."
"That's the promise we made with Mutsumi."
"I keep my promises."
"You should too."

[Youko]
"Mutsumi is gone."

[Taichi]
"Yeah but our promise remains!"

I shouted.

[Taichi]
"It's still in my heart."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I'm the one who will decide when the promise will
be broken."
"I'll decide on my own principles."

[Youko]
"You're still saying those things..."
"You're mean, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Please leave."
"You're not welcome here."
"You shouldn't ask for comfort from someone like
me..."

[Youko]
"..."

Without a word.
Youko left.
She stopped once and looked at me.
Her mask was calm, revealing neither discouragement
nor disappointment.
But even I could tell she was extremely tired.
How strange.

[Taichi]
"Good night."

[Youko]
"Good night, Taichi."
"I love you."

And she disappeared.
Feeling overwhelmed, I leaned my back against the
refrigerator and slid to the floor.

[Taichi]
"What was that..."
