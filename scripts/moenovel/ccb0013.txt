I dreamed about Sakuraba pushing me down.

[Taichi]
"This is too surreal."

A guy like him shouldn't have the guts to push
someone over.
Mutsumi had prepared breakfast.
She wasn't home very often, but I was grateful.
I ate half, and took the rest with me.
Time to go to school.
I listened to Sakuraba shriek, and ran into a
neighbor, Yusa.

[Yusa]
"Oh, good morning."

This was the definition of daily life.
Things like curry rolls and Yusa's jest.
I established good terms with her all over a
handkerchief.
We promised to exchange diaries and the like.
Our memories recorded in a colorful green notebook.
Along with a faint refreshing mint smell.
