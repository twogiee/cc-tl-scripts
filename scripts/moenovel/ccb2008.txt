So, we went to Touko Kirihara's mansion.

[Touko]
"Anyway, just this!"

Just this.
That's what she said.
Enough to fill three hitch carts.
So instead, we decided to use her camping car.
I could drive it too.
Thanks to all the driving manga I read.
But just reading about driving and actually driving
are two different things.
Things happened, and it traumatized Touko.
She even said, she would never get in a car when I
am driving again.
I felt the same.
Thank goodness we used seat belts.
In any case, I got to drive until we entered my
neighborhood, so we just needed to move the stuff
from here.
But still, we had a pretty good distance.
We searched around for something to lug the stuff.
Touko thought that hitch carts were just bikes with
baskets. As a representative of the underprivileged,
I grabbed her boobs.
She punched me. It was great.
So we unloaded the stuff using the cart, in three
round trips.
We were exhausted.
Then Touko's words beat me down even more.
The first thing she said about my room.

[Touko]
"What is this? A storage room?"

I was so exhausted, I collapsed.
