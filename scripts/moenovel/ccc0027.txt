I went to the rooftop.
It was past 10 o'clock.
Not that there were any classes going on...
I just wanted to be around the school.
I just wanted to go through the day with the
same routine.
It was like taking a tranquilizer...
There was no one on the rooftop.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Or so I thought.
I guess she had club.
I looked up at the antenna.
People vanished from the world.
And still, we were individuals who were unable to
unify.
Even if we were unified, it didn't change the fact
of how powerless we were.
My spirit was jarred with the heavy situation that
each individual went through.

[Taichi]
"..."

I wondered if direct sunlight was dangerous.
There was an alarm clock on the ground.
Mimi's belonging?
I decided to set the alarm for five minutes.
That would wake her.
Mimi didn't have the sleepyhead attribute.
I went towards the stairway, put my fingers
through the suicide prevention fence.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

The fence was fragile in one spot.
Just lightly pushing it caused it to slowly
collapse.
It could fall with a little more push.

[Taichi]
"That's dangerous."

That was a serious management problem especially for
the people living in their own fantasy in Gunjo.

[Taichi]
"..."

Well, nothing to worry about with the members who
are here now.
No one was going through any difficulty in their
daily lives.
I slowly made my way towards the stairs.
I opened the door.
The alarm went off behind me and...

[Misato]
"Ahhh...Huh?"

I could hear Mimi's strange voice.
I grinned, and closed the door behind me.
