[Taichi]
"Coming!"
"Who is it?"

[Yusa]
"Er, um, it's Doujima."

[Taichi]
"Such a wicked-sounding name attached to such a cute
voice... Is that you, Yusa? It's open, come in!"

The door timidly swung open, to reveal a beautiful
young woman standing there.

[Yusa]
"G-good evening."

I gave her a seat and poured her some barley tea.
We had been chatting for a while, when...

[Yusa]
"Um, so today is my birthday."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, really?"

[Yusa]
"So here...a birthday present for you."

[Taichi]
"Ummm...well, thanks. But, uh...?"

[Yusa]
"In thanks for all you've done for me."
"Also, if you happened to finish going over our
exchange diaries..."

[Taichi]
"Well, here's the diary, and this is a birthday gift
from me."

[Yusa]
"..."

Yusa was the kind of girl who would get lost for
words when she was surprised.
And she looked over maximum capacity right now...
Anyway...
I guess I'd explain the present to her next time.
But there never would be a next time.
I had no idea how she used the handy walkie-talkie I
had given her as a present.
It had been pretty cheap to buy. It was supposed to
be used to for talking with other people, but it
could also be used to wiretap other devices.
It showed the connectivity between people to people.
You could listen to people's conversations
on cell phones or truck radio devices
if you changed the radio frequency at random.
There weren't many people who would wiretap
for their own amusement.
It was hard to say exactly why I was so drawn to
wiretapping.
There were radio waves everywhere.
In the air.
There were there, just waiting for someone to listen
in.
And then...

[Taichi]
"Well then, I better walk you home."

[Yusa]
"?!"

She got even more lost for words at that.

[Taichi]
"It's nighttime, there might be creepers lying in
wait."

Especially around these parts.

[Taichi]
"Shall we?"

[Yusa]
"O-okay."

And so I walked with her.

[Yusa]
"You're always asking me that question, Taichi."
"I don't really know what you mean but...
all right."
"It's persistent!"

It was persistent.
Persistent.
Was it?
No.
Offensive.
Offensive.
Yes, offensive.
A violent assault.
Ah, yes.
I liked that word.
I laughed in my head.
Endlessly.
Ridiculed.
Sunken emotions were instantly swallowed
by the ravine.
The mental plate that guarded cynicism melted away,
and left only nothingness... It was like floating
unborn in the womb.
I had only one thought.
Enemies are enemies.
Kill or be killed.
