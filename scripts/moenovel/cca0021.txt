*clang clang clang*
*clang clang clang*
Club activities were in full swing on the rooftop
that morning, as always.

[Taichi]
"Heeey!!"

[Misato]
"Good mor-?!"

Misato yelled out from the top of the ladder.
But she somehow got flustered...
...and fell.

[Misato]
"Ouch-ouch-ouch-"

[Taichi]
"Even roosters don't crow this loud in the morning."

[Misato]
"I-I wasn't crowing!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, Miss Mangled, what happened now?"

There wasn't much meaning to what I said,
just a sensitivity behind it.

[Misato]
"Ooh..."

[Taichi]
"I'm hardly alive at this hour as it is."

[Misato]
"I-I wasn't building it behind your back! I just
woke up at 5 am today, because something was
bothering me."

Misato gestured wildly as she explained herself.

[Taichi]
"You've betrayed me..."

[Misato]
"N-no I haven't!"

[Taichi]
"Ohhhh, you're so cold and uncaring, Misato!"

[Misato]
"No, but that's...!"
"That's right, I messed up. Sorry, Taichi."

She raised both hands in defeat.

[Taichi]
"I've caught the perp red-handed at precisely
7:50 am."

[Misato]
"Yep!"

She extended both wrists just as a prisoner would.
And around those wrists...
*click*

[Misato]
"Huh?"

"You have the right to remain silent..."

[Misato]
"What are these?!"

[Taichi]
"Handcuffs..."

[Misato]
"Toy ones, right?"

[Taichi]
"Real ones..."

Silence...

[Misato]
"Wh-wh-wh-why do you have real ones?!"

[Taichi]
"The police station was empty, and I found a pair
there..."

[Misato]
"But why... Heheh, well, I guess you're beyond
reasoning!"

She could be so bratty.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah, afraid so!"

We shared a smile.

[Misato]
"So where's the key?"

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, the key... Err, where is the key?"

Misato kept her smile.

[Misato]
"Hmmm."
"Ahahah..."

She laughed.

[Misato]
"Excuse me Pekke, but I could've sworn I heard you
say, 'Where is the key'..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's what I said."

Her face went expressionless.

[Misato]
"You know, you're in no place to complain if I hurt
you, now."

[Taichi]
"I-I might be okay with that!"
"Argh-!"

She assaulted me.

[Misato]
"Why would you do something so thoughtless?!"

[Taichi]
"I was, uh, just going with the flow of things..."

[Misato]
"But I can't get free without a key!"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry, we'll look for the key, okay?"

[Misato]
"It should be at that police station, right?"

[Taichi]
"Of course! I'll look for it on my way home."

[Misato]
"You'll get it now, you hear me?"

Grrr...

[Taichi]
"Okay... Right away..."

She had me in the Misato Death Grip. I didn't really
have a choice.

[Taichi]
"But please, just stay calm until I get back!"

[Misato]
"I can't even change my clothes like this!"

[Taichi]
"Well, how about in the classroom?"

[Misato]
"That could work..."

We returned to the school building.

[Misato]
"Let's hope no one else is here..."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Misato]
"It'll look like I'm being hauled off to jail,
right?"

[Taichi]
"No matter how you look at it, it'll seem a little
freaky."

[Misato]
"A little freaky?"

[Taichi]
"Your classroom was on the third floor, right?"

[Misato]
"Yeah."

Just as we reached Misato's classroom,
Miki showed up.

[Miki]
"Hiya!"

[Misato]
"Wha?!"

Misato tried to quickly hide her hands, but failed.
The towel she used to cover them fluttered
to the ground.
It would have been better had she not moved at all.

[Miki]
"..."
"Y-you're being arrested...?"

[Misato]
"N-no, this is just a prank!"

[Miki]
"..."
"Um, you guys..."

She raised her hand.

[Taichi]
"What is it, Officer Yamanobe?"

[Miki]
"I think the nurse's office is empty today!"

She saluted as she informed us of a convenient place
for our freaky activities.
Ahhh, what a wonderful servant of the people...

[Misato]
"Hm?"

And poor, innocent Misato had no idea.

[Taichi]
"Right on, thanks. How about you, Miki?"

[Miki]
"I'm thinking I'll keep my innocence for a little
while longer."

[Taichi]
"Still innocent, huh...?"
"What a shame..."

[Miki]
"Good work today, sir!"

She gave us a sharp bow, then saw us off.

[Misato]
"I don't quite understand what you two were talking
about just now."

[Taichi]
"I'd be amazed if you did."

[Misato]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Well then..."

I stood before the train station.
Though its compact size barely qualified it to be
called one.
It was a good thing the area was well-kept.
The police station should be right around here.
The "On Patrol" sign was hung, and there was no one
present inside.
Either way, I soon spotted the key.
Was this considered theft?
Oh, it most definitely was.
And theft of police equipment, at that.
Taichi, the king of petty misdemeanors,
committing his last crime.

[Taichi]
"Here it is."

I had to get back soon.
No one had been walking by around the station.
This station had never been more than an access
point for the residential and metropolitan areas, so
it was hardly ever crowded.
The plaza was asphalt, but it still gave off
a faint shimmer on hot days.
There were no cars in sight.
So I walked down the middle of the road.

[Taichi]
"..."

No one was there to tell me not to.
I wondered about that.
The world was so empty.
No matter what crimes one decided to indulge in,
there would be no punishment and no one would even
be there to question it.
What an outrageous world.
And yet, there I was, in such a place.
Can you even commit a crime in a world of one?
No, you can't.
In a world without other people as a counterpoint,
most 'crimes' would lose their meaning.
It was idealistic.
One could call that an ideal society.
A singular society. A society without divisions.
What kind of skills would be necessary for such a
society?
What what kind of know-how?
Humans have many different desires.
Desires that go beyond want for the simple
necessities of living.
What were those desires?
The want to succeed.
The want to know.
The want to create.
The want to conquer.
These desires were held by others, and their value
determined by them.
Desires are a manifestation
of seeking others' recognition.
Recognition of one's wealth.
Recognition of one's knowledge.
Recognition of one's success.
It's all predicated on other people.
Desire is rooted in the acquisition of people
who recognize the value of what you have.
It's like a form of currency.
Even without our current methods of spending it,
people would still desire this currency.
So long as humans lived with desire, the world was
stained with consciousness and values of others, and
this formed the character of who lived within that
value system.
What about in a society of one?
How would that affect desire?
No, the moment others disappeared, desire would lose
its definition and recede to simple craving.
There was no such thing as a race without a rival,
therefore running would lose the impetus of pursuit.
In a world of one, would there still be an
intellectual?
Would the artist still create without an audience?
Who would be left to conquer?
That's right.
In a society of one, people would lose that essence.
It would be inevitable.
There would be no negative feelings
pushing you to aspire for more.
If the world's sins were no longer sins...
This shift in perspective struck me like a divine
revelation.
I looked behind me.

[Taichi]
"How long do you intend to follow me?"

In such a vacant plaza, voices carried easily.

[Taichi]
"Don't you have something else to do?"

I waited.
But there was no response.

[Taichi]
"You're a weird one, you know that?"

I made my way back towards the school in disdain.
I couldn't be bothered by every little thing.
But a presence was steadily pursuing me.
I was grateful something was looking out for me.
However...

[Taichi]
"My hair's completely white, you don't know if I
have radiation sickness or not!"

I must've sounded like some spoiled child talking
back to his mother.
It was a new feeling, to be that exceedingly
unnerved.
I arrived at the school and let out a sigh of
relief.
I could no longer feel the presence following me.

[Taichi]
"Ah, man, that was nerve-racking."

But the goosebumps that presence always left me with
lingered on my skin.
Such a heavy presence...

[Taichi]
"Are you an evil spirit?"

It had to be near.
I dreaded being the object of that being's
admiration.
*GRRR*
It was my stomach growling.
It was like a wild beast.
The beast's cry was powerful.

[Taichi]
"I smell food..."

I staggered off to the school cafeteria.
