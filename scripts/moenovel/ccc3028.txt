[Taichi]
"Heeey!"

[Miki]
"You're sooooo late!"

I had returned to the rooftop.

[Miki]
"Oh, you came with Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Of course."

[Misato]
"Is it just me...or you look full of energy."

[Taichi]
"I AM full of energy."

[Miki]
"What's up, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"Oh, uh, nothing..."

[Miki]
"The girls business is over now, right?"

[Kiri]
"Mm-hm, finished..."

Kiri began restlessly rubbing her legs together.

[Misato]
"Your complexion's not too good, are you sure you're
all right?"

[Kiri]
"I'm fine. Just a little tired...must be the heat."

[Taichi]
"That's no good. You need to drink my special white
juice to fight the summer heat."

I took out my canteen.

[Misato]
"Thank you, Pekke."

Misato received the canteen.
At a glance, it looked like any other lactic
product, but my elixir had a very special
ingredient.

[Miki]
"White juice?"

[Misato]
"Ah, what could that be?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I looked to the sky.
Was it some sort of UFO? Or a mother ship?

[Misato]
"...Glug glug glug glug."

[Taichi]
"There was nothing?"

[Misato]
"Phew, thanks for that!"

Misato handed back the now-empty canteen.

[Taichi]
"...You already drank it?"

[Misato]
"Yes, the three of us enjoyed it!"

[Miki]
"What? When?"

[Taichi]
"Hahahahah!"

[Misato]
"Heheheheh!"

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahahaha!"

[Misato]
"Heheheheheheheh!"

Oh good.

[Miki]
"Um...it looked like you just poured it out..."

Mimi quickly threw her arms around Miki and gave her
a huge hug.

[Miki]
"Mmmmmm!"

Their chests squished together beautifully.

[Taichi]
"You dumped it?"

[Misato]
"Hey, come take a look! I've got it mostly ready!"

She took me with her.

[Taichi]
"Uh...okay?"

[Miki]
"Hey, Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Hm, what is it?"

[Miki]
"Nothing..."

[Kiri]
"Hm?"

I could hear them talking behind us.
I was a bit curious of their conversation, but my
attention was turned towards the tent.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Rubber."

[Sakuraba]
"Rubber. Like with a lover."

Sakuraba was inside the tent.

[Taichi]
"Where's Tomoki?"

[Sakuraba]
"That sister complex had something to take care of
at home."

[Taichi]
"Is that so...?"

[Sakuraba]
"He did the wiring though. That Tomoki's a hard
worker."

[Taichi]
"Got it."

Well, if they had come this far
there was nothing to worry about, right?

[Misato]
"Why don't we take a break? I'm pretty thirsty."

Misato took a can of green tea from the mini-fridge.

[Taichi]
"Huh? You're still thirsty?"

[Misato]
"Hey, check out it, we're able to restore some
modern technologies with spare batteries!"

It was a fridge, smaller than the one in the
clubroom.

[Taichi]
"Wow..."

Tomoki's handiwork.

[Misato]
"We haven't had cold drinks in forever!"
"Here's your portion!"

[Taichi]
"That's well and good, but... Misato, my white
juice...?"

[Misato]
"Cheers!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, all right... Cheers."

Maybe my white juice wasn't enough.
It was a special lactic drink with lemon juice...
Oh, well.
We took a quick drink and rested in the tent's
shade.

[Taichi]
"Haaah, that's the refreshment we needed, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"After we worked up such a sweat..."

[Kiri]
*cough cough*
"Taichi!!"

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Miki]
"Did you both go for a leak?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, we went in the bushes.
We wanted to see whose would go further."

[Kiri]
"We did not! I couldn't possibly!"

[Miki]
"You kept this fun event...as a secret?"

[Kiri]
"Miki, nothing about that seems fun..."

[Miki]
"Really?"

Even in the face of rapidly progressing
deforestation in recent years, Miki still should be
naive and innocent as ever.
...?

[Taichi]
"If you keep moving around like that, everyone will
be able to see it, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri held down the fringe of her skirt and went
completely silent.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

[Sakuraba]
"By the way Taichi, I wrote the script for
tomorrow's broadcast as Misato requested."

[Taichi]
"Really, you did such a thing?"

[Sakuraba]
"Give it a look. I want your feedback."

[Taichi]
"..."

I wasn't able to read it.

[Taichi]
"What language is this?"

[Sakuraba]
"Just in case our transmission got intercepted,
I multi-encrypted it."

I hit him over the head.

[Taichi]
"That doesn't make any sense!"

[Misato]
"Awww, it was a waste of time leaving it to
Sakuraba..."

[Taichi]
"What's the point of an SOS message thats not
understandable?!"

And then...

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

I heard the sound of bells on the breeze.

[Taichi]
"That's a wind chime, right?"

[Sakuraba]
"I hung it up."
"I thought it'd be nice for when we're all hanging
out here."

[Taichi]
"Hm..."

He sometimes had some sensible ideas as well.
Humankind was on the brink of extinction.
We couldn't know if there was any hope.
And yet, Sakuraba was so...carefree.

[Taichi]
"Of course, we're going to hang out."

[Sakuraba]
"Right?"

[Misato]
"Let's make good use of it."

[Taichi]
"For as long as we can."

Misato casted a pleased look with happiness in her
eyes.

[Miki]
"Kiri you don't seem very well."

[Kiri]
"R-really? Do I really look that bad?"

[Taichi]
"..."

Perhaps I had been pushing her too hard.
The truth and the act, must have become quite a
burden for Kiri.
However...
Only one day left. That's all the world had.
If there were something that could heal Kiri's
heart, it was certainly out of my grasp.
So.
So...
