[Misato]
"Will...I be forgiven after this?"

Misato said as she buttoned her blouse.
She seemed down.
And it wasn't because I teased her so much.
She just knew.
The crime itself wasn't resolved even if she received
an unsuitable punishment.
Well, originally...

[Misato]
"Will I...be forgiven now...?"

[Taichi]
"Crime itself will never be forgiven."

I looked out to the sea and kicked up some sand.
The transparent sand danced around in the wind.

[Misato]
"Then...there's nothing that can be done."

With gloom in her voice, she spoke while pausing
between words.

[Taichi]
"..."

If I was a better person, I could've given her
words of encouragement.
Instead I went with a no BS approach...
And that was that.
There was nothing that could be done.
All because I was convinced that it was the definite
truth.
The silence conveyed an intention.

[Misato]
"Uhh... Ugghhh..."

I had no way to comfort her.
I got a little carried away.
I teased Misato.
To a happy ending.
I was supposed to be giving her trauma counseling.

[Taichi]
"This is hard..."

I hid my face.
I realized I had failed.

[Misato]
"Nicknames are given to those close to you."

[Taichi]
"Right..."

[Misato]
"Let's make up nicknames for each other."

It sounded like she considered us pets.
She certainly liked me like she would a pet.
Either way...
Underneath her smile, I couldn't tell if there was
any deep affection.
I was still on guard.

[Taichi]
"Then, how about Mimi...?"

That was the name I came up with
after all that thinking.

[Misato]
"That's no different at all."

[Taichi]
"I think it sort of makes sense. Unless you want me
to go with Ms. Miyasumi."

[Misato]
"Hmm, your name is Taichi Kurosu, sooo..."

She wasn't even listening.

[Misato]
"Hmm, Just Taichi would be too boring."

[Taichi]
"Boring? Hey, that's my actual name..."

I felt somewhat hurt by that.

[Misato]
"Kurosu... That sounds like cross... And a cross looks
like...an X!"

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna have to go with a no on that one."

I lowered my head.

[Misato]
"Whaaat!"

[Taichi]
"I don't want to be called 'X'..."

[Misato]
"Then... How about Pekke..."
"Pekke?"

[Taichi]
"You brew out another idiotic-sounding name."

[Misato]
"Ah, but it feels good. I like it."

Pekke?
Really? You had to base it off of "X"?

[Taichi]
"Wait a minute... Aren't X symbols used for bad
things?"

[Misato]
"It could be good, it could be bad."
"The symbol for Pekke is a cross."

[Taichi]
"The lines don't even support each other. They
pierce right through."

I shook my head left and right.
Or maybe lines only passed by each other...
Anyhow, they seemed bleak.

[Taichi]
"I can only take that as it passed right through..."

[Misato]
"It's a symbol filled with hope that even we, people
repelled from society, can cross paths with others."

[Taichi]
"That sounds hypocritical."

And forceful.

[Misato]
"Okay, that's it for me. Now it's your turn."

It was official.

[Taichi]
"Right."

I had to comply at this point.
I'd only known her for a short time, but I still
understood her well.

[Taichi]
"Then... Lady Slave."

[Misato]
"There are no slaves in this constitutional
government."

[Taichi]
"Love Slave."

[Misato]
"How is that any different?"

[Taichi]
"Sow?"

[Misato]
"Your upperclassman is going to be a sow,
are you okay with that?"

[Taichi]
"Ms. Boobies."

[Misato]
"Y-you've been looking at my chest like that...?"

[Taichi]
"Milking Slave."

[Misato]
"I don't understand why you have to bring that
back..."
"Will you lay off the boobs?"

She had a lot of requests.

[Taichi]
"Erotic Glasses..."

[Misato]
"Rejected."

[Taichi]
"You've rejected all of them!"

I screamed.
I couldn't keep my cool.

[Misato]
"Because you keep suggesting weird names!"

[Taichi]
"Then Glasses Woman."

[Misato]
"That's just my looks. Will you twist that around?"

Perfect for a girl who called me "X" at one point.

[Taichi]
"Mimi..."

[Misato]
"What was that?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi, from Misato Miyasumi."

[Misato]
"Ah, that sounds nice."

She smiled softly.
A smile that made her look slow.
But...
Strangely self-conscious.

[Taichi]
"Then again, there are three 'mi's... So Mimimi?"
"How about that, Mimimi?"

[Misato]
"That sounds like a dumb heroine..."

She was a dumb enough person to be talking to a
dangerous being like me.
So dumb...that it made me want to be nice.

[Taichi]
"Mimi..."

[Misato]
"Ah, that, that's good."

[Taichi]
"Is that so."

[Misato]
"Let's make it official."

She stuck out her pinky finger.
I thought it was a bit off, but I complied. We pinky
swore.

[Taichi]
"You're just going to give me that name and use me a
lot. I'm not sure how different that is from
slavery."

[Misato]
"It's forced labor with love."
"Err, I mean like friendly love, okay?"

[Taichi]
"Either way."

I shrugged.
