[Taichi]
"Wow. No one's around."

There weren't many security guards around.
Normally there'd be ten or so, but today only two
were on duty.
It was quite hot, so the mental stress must have
caused a bunch of them to take the day off.
The cafeteria was also empty.
Which meant that I had to compete with no one for
the good stuff!
On second thought...it'd be easier to just use my
connections.
Or maybe I shouldn't use them...
It was a forbidden technique.
A double-edged sword.
But come on, Yusa's so cute...
I bought a ticket for a B-set meal and brought it to
the counter.

[Voice]
"Hey you! What do you think you're doing?!"

[Taichi]
"H-huh?!"

She appeared out of nowhere!

[Voice]
"Thought you would sneak by me? hohoho!"

And she laughed, like a giant pirate boss who
appears at a cave full of booze in fantasy games (at
times, the boss seems bigger than the cave itself).
It was terrifying.

[Taichi]
"Don't scare this delicate bookworm like that,
Lunch Lady!!"

[Lunch Lady]
"You, a bookworm?! Not even the dummies miss
as much class as you!"

Her voice boomed throughout the cafeteria.
The reinforced glass shook from the force
(impossible, I know).
I could feel the attention of the entire cafeteria
on me.

[Taichi]
"Your voice is too loud, Lunch Lady..."

[Lunch Lady]
"My voice is perfectly normal, you kids are just
crybabies!"
"I won't go easy on you either!"

[Taichi]
"Wait, what?!"

I took a step back, sensing something bad was about
to happen.
Her huge palms, which could only be described as
grotesque, reached across and blocked my vision.

[Taichi]
(Is this) (PDA?) (Will I die...) (...if I get hit?!)

[Lunch Lady]
"Ah, I guess you are a clever boy after all!
Hohoho!"
"I suppose you came for a meal?"

[Taichi]
"Y-yeah..."

I handed her my meal ticket the way a zoo-keeper
would feed a lion.

[Lunch Lady]
"You're always looking out for Yusa, so I guess I'll
treat you this time."

[Taichi]
"Heheheh, thanks, heheh."

That's right.
This woman was the birth-mother of the ultimate
beauty, Yusa.
In other words, in a few decades, this would be
Yusa's fate...

[Matron]
"What's wrong? You're a bit wobbly."

[Taichi]
"Excusez-moi, I just felt a little dizzy."

[Matron]
"Well, that's no good. It's because you're all
skin and bones."

Mama had made up her mind.

[Matron]
"All right, S-set it is."

[Taichi]
"There's an S-set?"

[Matron]
"Yeah, it's one I made especially for you!"

Her booming voice once again resonated throughout
the cafeteria.
*whisper whisper*
Great, whispering all throughout the cafeteria's
just what I needed...

[Taichi]
"I'm grateful Mama, but..."

[Matron]
"Oh, you called me Mama! I could just die!"

The S-set doubled in size.

[Matron]
"Hey, how are things with you and my daughter?"

[Taichi]
"Hm? Whatever do you mean?"

[Matron]
"You must've won her over by now!"

[Taichi]
*cough* *hack*

[Matron]
"My son-in-law, how wonderful! Hohoho!"

[Taichi]
"Son-in-law?!"
"Hey, maybe that can wait a few more years, Mama!"

[Matron]
"It's all right, you don't need to worry!"

She added two pork cutlets to the plate.
Was this supposed to be some sort of bribe?
*whisper whisper*

[Taichi]
"Uhhh..."

Everyone was gossiping!
I never had so many people talking about me before!

[Matron]
"You've got enough to worry about, no need to
trouble yourself over this one!"
"Just leave it to me!"

The cafeteria miso soup usually just contained
seaweed, but she put some crab in it.
*whisper whisper whisper*

[Student]
"Taking bribes..."
"Nepotism..."
"Insider trading..."
"Hardly seems legal..."
"What a controversial visit..."

[Taichi]
"Urk!"

Not good, not good.
This would affect the good name of Taichi Kurosu.
The two pork cutlets became four.

[Taichi]
"That's far too much!"

[Matron]
"Hm? Don't tell me you can't eat all of this,
you're a growing boy!"

She slapped my shoulder with her barnacle-like hand.
The sheer weight sent me sprawling to the floor.

[Taichi]
"Gwaaah!"

I got to my knees.

[Matron]
"Oh, how rude of me! Gwahaha! You still haven't
eaten yet! We've gotta fatten you up!"

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

Yusa... If you don't leave home soon, you'll be
fattened up too.
Carrying the tray loaded with food enough for five
people, I grabbed the first seat I could find.

[Tomoki]
"Looks like someone's well-connected, as always."

Tomoki set his C-set tray down and took a seat
next to me.

[Taichi]
"Is that right, Professor Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"That's a pretty nice tray you got there."

[Taichi]
"Please, help yourself."

[Tomoki]
"Are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"There's no way I can eat all of this."

[Tomoki]
"Don't mind if I do then!"

He took a pork cutlet.

[Tomoki]
"I had some bread with Sakuraba earlier, but it
wasn't nearly enough."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, you were in the sports club."

[Tomoki]
"Well, I'm not weight training anymore, but..."

[Taichi]
"Muscly people have to consume so much fatty food.
That's why their eating habits are so bad."

[Tomoki]
"Huh. So it's better not to have so much muscle?"

[Taichi]
"Don't be dumb. Doing a moderate amount
of muscle training is fine."

[Tomoki]
"Of course."

[Taichi]
"Is Sakuraba still all about curry rolls?"

[Tomoki]
"He ate about seven."

[Taichi]
"Ugh."

[Tomoki]
"The cafeteria staff calls him the Curry Roll
Monster."

[Taichi]
"What a dumb name."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, pretty dumb."

And so we ate.

[Taichi]
"Man, it never ends!"

[Tomoki]
"Need some help?"

[Taichi]
"Please take some!"

[Tomoki]
"Hey, there's crab in your miso soup!"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

[Tomoki]
"What kind of connections do you have...?"

[Taichi]
"The strongest binding of all, that of a son-in-law."

[Tomoki]
"You mean the lunch lady's daughter and you...?"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

[Tomoki]
"She must take after her mother."

[Taichi]
"Nope, she's a super-cute girl with glasses. She's
become pretty attached to me. She hangs on my
every word."

[Tomoki]
"Then you've got no problem."

[Taichi]
"Well..."
"For someone like me who wants an aggressive job
making tons of money, having a filly and a feline
aren't in the books."

[Tomoki]
"Sounds like nonsense to me."
"Oh, Taichi, how did you do on your adaptability
test?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, you know..."

I poured myself some barley tea from the
self-service counter and gulped it down.

[Taichi]
"It was exasperating, I couldn't handle it. The
proctor was looking at me like I wasn't human."

[Tomoki]
"What was your score?"

[Taichi]
"84\p."

[Tomoki]
"Whoa, and that's before grading on a curve!"

[Taichi]
"I know. It's pretty wild. Maybe I'm not human
after all."

[Tomoki]
"They might even dissect you in the research
building."

[Taichi]
"Have a little compassion!"

I clung to him tightly.

[Tomoki]
"No can do... I'm on a whole different plane of
existence with my 17\p."

[Taichi]
"Say what?! What's with that average-ass score?!"

[Tomoki]
"Well, I'm disabled, for one..."

[Taichi]
"Oh, right..."
"I figured you were just an idiot."

[Tomoki]
"You're one to talk!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, I'll bet Rubber's score is pretty low, too."

[Tomoki]
"I think he got 15\p."

[Taichi]
"That guy's got heart problems, right? How'd he get
into Gunjo with those grades?"

[Tomoki]
"I think he applied for Gunjo specifically."

We exchanged glances.

[Taichi]
"Doesn't make sense at all, does it..."

[Tomoki]
"Nope..."

[Taichi]
"The national exams seem kinda half-assed, huh?"
"Oh hey, I almost forgot, you'd better make nice
with your big sister soon!"
"I know It's not that simple but..."

[Tomoki]
"Si-... Mimi betrayed me..."

Was he going to say "sis" just now?
Didn't matter.

[Taichi]
"She did?"

Mimi and Tomoki were siblings.
Though they didn't share a last name.

[Tomoki]
"I joined the broadcast club against my will. I
wasn't thinking to join any clubs, but she told me
you were a computer whiz, so I should help."
"Help him because he's a computer whiz?
Does it make sense to you?"

[Taichi]
"No comprende."
"It's fine though. It's hardly like a club anyway."

[Tomoki]
"I guess it doesn't matter then... It's not like
this school has a basketball club."

[Taichi]
"Couldn't play if it had one, anyway."

[Tomoki]
"Oh well..."

[Taichi]
"Give it up. It's not like there are any pushy
seniors around to hassle you. Things are pretty
easy-going here."

[Tomoki]
"If I quit, I'll have time to read all the comics I
want."
"Why do I have to make nice and do club activities
with my sister now, after all this time?"

[Taichi]
"A sister complex error has occurred."

[Tomoki]
"Come again?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind!"

Those were memories from a year ago.
