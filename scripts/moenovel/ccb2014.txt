Without any thought, I turned towards the entrance.
*Baaaaam*

[Taichi]
*spoot*

I spit out all my water.
Eeeeeeeep!
She saw...she saw...!
From when and where?!

[Taichi]
"Oh no, no, no, no!"

I didn't know which way to run.
I hit the corner of a desk and bent over.

[Taichi]
"Owww!"

I straightened my clothes out.
I was a gentleman. I was an aristocrat.
I felt someone's gaze burning onto me, and I looked
up.

[Youko]
"..."

Her lips moved.
I could read them.
T R A I T O R.

[Taichi]
"Eeeeep!"

They kept moving.
I  W I L L  M A K E
Y O U  P A Y  F O R  T H I S.
Was she going to kill me?!
I hid my face.
But, the killing blow never came.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

When I looked, she was already gone.

[Taichi]
"She let me go?"

I had forgotten her, my terrifying watcher.
She was a formidable foe, with senses rivalling
those of a mother discovering her child's porn
stash.

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm safe for now."

I took another drink.
My throat was parched.
I looked over towards Touko.
Someone had scribbled on her face with a marker.

[Taichi]
*spoot*

Another spit take.
In that short of time!
And without me sensing anything?!
What is she? A Super Ninja?
So...what had she written?
I took a look.
"Perv Woman." "Total Nympho."

[Taichi]
"How cruel!"

A jealous woman was a terrifying thing...
For the time being, I tried to make Touko look
presentable.
I straightened her clothes.
I made sure her underwear was riding up.
There, the perfect bottom.
Gotta make sure those undies were riding up, you
know?
Now, the scribbles... Hmmm, it's permanent.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

She couldn't see it herself, so I guessed I could
leave it...

[Touko]
"Mm...Tai...chi..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I went to the Art room.
I took some thinner from the teacher's room.
I diluted it and put some on a cloth.
I rubbed.
Rubbed.
And rubbed.
And finally, her eggshell skin was clean.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, Touko..."

*growl*
It was my stomach which growled.
It was like a wild beast.
The beast in my stomach was growling loudly.

[Taichi]
"Ugh, I'm so hungry..."

Then.
*growl*
That, came from Touko's stomach.

[Taichi]
"Pffff...Hah!"
