Yutaka Shinkawa was full of energy. Pretty much all
the time.
He had quick responses.
He was a snappy conversationalist, too.
He was always up for whatever.
One day, that Shinkawa said...

[Shinkawa]
"My niece is gonna attend Gunjo as well, so I gotta
go teach her all about it."

My struggle began.
Apparently, she was super cute too...
The struggled intensified. I was all jealousy and
envy.
When those two lined up, you could hate almost
anyone. That's human nature.
I didn't though.
Since, the next thing he said brought a greater
shock to me.

[Shinkawa]
"It's true, to me she's like a little sister who
I live with."

He was living with a cute, non-blood-relation
sister-figure...
I also heard later on, his parents were almost never
home.
I do believe they usually call that situation
"cohabitation."
Now, the two of them were coming to Gunjo together.

[Shinkawa]
"Sure, I'll introduce you to my niece, too!"
"It's not that big of a deal... Don't expect
too much from it, all right?"

Not that big a deal...
I did meet her, later.

[Shinkawa]
"So, let me introduce you. This is Kiri Sakura.
She's like family."

I believe they usually called this a "bolt out of
the blue."

[Shinkawa]
"What's wrong? Why are you two so quiet? Don't tell
that the two of you are being shy. Especially you,
Taichi. There's no need to be shy with this monkey."

[Kiri]
"Yutaka, shut up..."
"I'm...Kiri Sakura."

[Taichi]
"T-Taichi Kurosu..."

I bowed awkwardly.

[Taichi]
"I've heard about you..."

[Kiri]
"...Sure."

She was the girl...that axe kicked me...
If I remember correctly...we had parted as sworn
enemies.
I could see no trace of goodwill in Kiri's eyes.
Indeed, they were merely scornful.

[Kiri]
"I also have heard rumors."

[Taichi]
"I-is that right?"

Full of nervous tension, I lifted the teacup to my
lips.

[Taichi]
"Ah, this tea is so sweet! It's like pure sugar, oh
my. It is so gritty... Mmm, such unique texture!"

[Kiri]
"..."

Tough crowd.
A comeback was a kind of affection to some extent.

[Shinkawa]
"Dude, that is pure sugar."

[Taichi]
"...Greatly appreciate it."

The comeback was needed.

[Kiri]
"I hear that you sexually harass anything you can
get your hands on."

[Shinkawa]
"Yeah, he really goes nuts. It's almost scary."

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm not sure harassment would be correct...
It's my way of showing my sexual interest in a
lovable and friendly way..."

[Kiri]
"Yeah...that's sexual harassment."

[Taichi]
"Oh, is that so?! Ahahahah!"

I could feel invisible knives slicing me to ribbons.

[Kiri]
"Some of the girls don't like it, right?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, if they really don't like it I desist. I can
certainly tell when someone truly dislikes it."

[Kiri]
"So, then, does Miyuki like all your sexual
harassment?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, well, I guess she doesn't? Of course, that's
all on the surface, milady. The mouth may lie, but
the body never does."

[Kiri]
"Horrible..."

She spit the word out, quietly.
But I heard it.
Yutaka, who was busy peeling his baumkuchen into
thin layers, didn't.
This idiot, doesn't have a clue what's going.
I tried making eye contact with him.

[Shinkawa]
"?!"

He finally noticed.
That's right, help me!
I cried out with my eyes.

[Shinkawa]
"Oh!!"

With pompous pride Yutaka gave a little "leave it to
me" nod.

[Shinkawa]
"Oh...Oh no! My period started! I've got to go buy
some pads, so can you two stay here and talk for a
while?"

[Both]
Kiri: "Stay."
Taichi: "Stay, please, I'm begging you."

[Shinkawa]
"Hm?"

He didn't get it at all.
If he left us alone, this unpleasantness would turn
explosive.

[Kiri]
"Well, the way I see it... I don't think Miyuki
wanted her skirt pulled up."

[Taichi]
"Oh, uh, is that so?"

Yutaka went back to disassembling his dessert.
This guy...hopeless...

[Kiri]
"I have a problem with the way you act, Kurosu."

She put it right out there.
To be perfectly honest, I didn't hate her type.
In fact, she was rather desirable... The kind of
girl who really drew me in.
I relaxed a little.
I decided to get serious with her.

[Taichi]
"Sakura, you have a sense of justice, don't you?"

She seemed to take offense.

[Kiri]
"What's that supposed to mean?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, no, nothing bad. I mean, people like you are
necessary."

[Kiri]
"I'm afraid I'm not understanding what you are
trying to say."

[Taichi]
"I'm not making fun of you."
"It's just that...I've never been around anyone like
you."

[Kiri]
"...I see."

When I looked over, Yutaka had fallen asleep where
he sat.
Ah, my friend. What a boon you were.
Now I felt like I could change things up a bit.

[Taichi]
"So how's Gunjo so far?"

[Kiri]
"Could you be more specific?"

[Taichi]
"Well, now you're in a class with different types of
people. Some who can't talk, or are in their own
world, or go crazy all of a sudden."
"All of them...one way or another, are unable to
adapt to society and were sent to Gunjo."
"Everyone there is an outsider of society. That
includes you and me, too."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Can you hold an actual conversation with any of
them? Could you consider any of them a friend?"
"Or even if you do talk to them, you never know what
will set them off. You will never feel safe."
"Like there is a guy in my class, if he hears the
sound of glass breaking, he will suddenly violently
attack people."

[Kiri]
"What does that have anything to do with the
conversation we were having?"

[Taichi]
"You preached to me about justice."
"...You talked to me as a person with common sense."

Her brow furrowed a little at this.

[Kiri]
"I didn't mean that..."

[Taichi]
"You did."
"You didn't like the way I acted and you pointed it
out. You felt that it needed to be fixed."
"That's not really a common way of thinking at
Gunjo."
"I can't tell if you're just slow, or if you're
actually sharp enough to see who I really am."
"But...for the first time in a while, I feel like
someone is treating me like a human."

[Kiri]
"..."

She seemed surprised.
She looked cute when she was relaxed.
Yutaka was blind as a bat.

[Kiri]
"That's not what I'm talking about!"

[Taichi]
"So, about Miyuki..."

Her rage stilled.

[Taichi]
"That whole thing is complicated."
"I don't know all the details, but apparently if she
gets too lonely, her symptoms appear."
"It's called external agnosia. The world starts to
go hazy, like she's on a bad trip. She could even be
a danger to herself..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Did you know?"

[Kiri]
"No..."

[Taichi]
"I have a feeling she's going to be transferred."

[Kiri]
"What do you mean?"

[Taichi]
"Sent to a proper hospital."

[Kiri]
"That's..."

Kiri was at a loss for words.

[Taichi]
"I mean, at school people always get lonely. And
since everyone here is caught up in their own
problems, nobody can look after her."
"The thing Miyuki hates most, being alone, is
everywhere."

For example, after school. The empty classroom.
For example, on the school grounds. The empty field.
For example, the classroom. Even if people are
there, they have no connection between them.

[Taichi]
"Gunjo is filled with empty spaces."
"The reason she's in the broadcast club is because
it's a group of people still keeping it together."
"That's kind of why we still go on as a club."
"Since there aren't really other clubs anyway.."

I shrugged.

[Taichi]
"It's hard to make friends. But we can't live
without making any. Do you know why?"

[Kiri]
"No..."

[Taichi]
"They're necessary, to maintain our hearts."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I became friends with Yutaka. That's a good thing."
"I wanted to become friends with Miyuki. But I guess
I went about it the wrong way."
"But I was just trying, the only way I know."

I smiled sadly.

[Taichi]
"I guess I'm just caught in my own cleverness."

[Kiri]
"So all of that sexual harassment... Was that
intentional?"

[Taichi]
"I have my own motives."

I answered honestly.

[Kiri]
"Huh?!"

[Taichi]
"My hold on reason is abnormally tenuous."
"But I can still act on my intentions."
"I just wanted to be part of a fun memory for her."

I took the pot from its cozy.
It was still hot. It was a very good tea cozy.
I poured a cup of tea, and drank it straight.

[Taichi]
"Everyone wants some kind of connection."
"Not just us. Everyone does."
"Cell phones, internet, letters, friends..."
"They're all a way to connect, right?"
"People hope someone is out there. So, they send
their messages, information and signals..."
"I don't want to think that the people I come in
touch with are empty inside."
"That's why I sexually harass people. And I will
continue doing so."
"No matter how much you try to stop me, I will never
stop."

I drank my cup dry.

[Taichi]
"If you want to stop me, try. Try kicks, try
armlocks."
"For me, even that is way of connecting with people,
I don't mind. You might not be too fond of it
though."

[Kiri]
"..."

She looked down.
The girl was thinking.
She was lost in a maze of thought I'd made for her.
I thought back over what I'd said.
It was like telling myself, "I'm broken but I'm
still trying" and stuff.
My consciousness was trying to hide my own deceit
deep inside of myself.

[Kiri]
"I can't accept that."

Kiri finally said.

[Kiri]
"That's all I can say for now..."

[Taichi]
"I see."

That was good.
I'm glad that she couldn't be fooled so easily.
Because the world was a corrupt place.

[Kiri]
"So, all that being what it is, once again. I'm Kiri
Sakura."

She bowed courteously.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Kiri]
"I'm...Kiri Sakura."

[Taichi]
"Um. Yeah. I'm Taichi Kurosu."

What an awkward meeting...

[Taichi]
"Okay then, well, it's about time to go... Since
Yutaka's asleep too..."

I stood up.

[Kiri]
"Sorry about that. He sleeps a lot."

[Taichi]
"Oh, and if you'd like a bit of change in life, just
come by the broadcast club."

[Kiri]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"But if you do come, you'll be a target. That's the
condition. Keep that in mind if you decide to come."

[Kiri]
"..."

Kiri smiled sarcastically.
That was the first time I saw her smile.
Miyuki had disappeared in less than a year.
Later, Kiri became friends with Miki and the two of
them joined the broadcast club.
My mind flew again, and I remembered that time in
detail.

[Taichi]
"Oh...you came."

[Miki]
"Heeeey!"

[Kiri]
"Hey there."

The two were like flowers planted in the same bed.

[Taichi]
"Flowers!"

[Misato]
"What's that?"

[Taichi]
"Their stage name. You've got to have stage names in
this club. We've all got them."

[Miki]
"Oh..."

[Tomoki]
"Again with the lie--!!"

I lashed out at him before he could finish.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki is The Immoral, Sakuraba is Mr. Vigilance,
and I'm The Love Aristocrat."

[Miki]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"But of course!"

[Miki]
"Then let's hear you use them in conversation."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Immoral, how's your sister complex trouble?
You still the ever-loving sister-lover?"

[Misato]
"Sister complex?"

[Tomoki]
"Shut up!!"

He choked me.
He was particularly intent with the girl herself
there.

[Taichi]
"God id...sdop...dyinnng..."

[Sakuraba]
"Oh, shall the Love Aristocrat die at the hands of
love?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed, I would love to die and meet my dear mommy
in heaven..."

[Misato]
"Stop that! Violence will get you suspended!"

Mimi gave Tomoki a chop to the head.

[Tomoki]
"O-www..."

[Taichi]
"I thought I was going to die!"

[Tomoki]
"It's your own fault."

[Kiri]
"Wow..."

Kiri seemed tired all the sudden.

[Taichi]
"Oh, what's with the wilting daisy act?"
"The broadcast club is really only a pretend club."

[Misato]
"Don't say that..."

[Taichi]
"As our beloved third-years move on to greater
things and you first-years fill the void, Mr.
Sakuraba has great hopes for you!"

[Sakuraba]
"Yes I do."

Sakuraba stood cool and calm, with a bottle dangling
from his finger he couldn't remove, and spoke.

[Sakuraba]
"Today I shall discuss the precept of mixed nuts."

[Taichi]
"Good one, teach!"

[Misato]
"Your finger is turning purple."

[Sakuraba]
"Some mixed nuts have peanuts. I'm sure you all
know..."

Sakuraba ignored her and spoke on. Or maybe he
couldn't hear her.
Miki nodded in understanding.
She was an earnest one.

[Sakuraba]
"Surprisingly, many people reject these peanuts."

[Miki]
"So true."

[Sakuraba]
"And I myself reject that as trickery! Why, do you
think?"

[Taichi]
"Um, because the presence of peanuts is what makes
them mixed nuts?"

[Sakuraba]
"Exactly! If you dislike peanuts, then eat pure
nuts! There is no call for all this whining about
peanuts, it harms the very dignity of mixed nuts!"
"It is foul trickery!"

[Taichi]
"Well said!"

[Sakuraba]
"And that is why I eat ONLY the peanuts in mixed
nuts."

[Taichi]
"...Are you an idiot?"

I came to my senses.

[Sakuraba]
"Do you all understand?"

[Taichi]
"Listen, will ya?"

[Sakuraba]
"I'm deaf in my right ear at times."

That was true...
It didn't hinder his daily life, though.

[Taichi]
"I find your ability to bring me back to my senses,
unforgivable."
"In the name of the Queen, I hereby append the
letter 'I' to the end of your name."

[Sakuraba]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"From now on, you're Sakurabai. Sakuraba-bye. Hello
Sakurabye."

Words are fun!

[Sakuraba]
"I accept it."

[Tomoki]
"Don't accept it."

[Sakuraba]
"That ends my speech."

He sat down and started wiggling his finger, trying
to get the bottle off.

[Misato]
"So this is our group."

She summed it all up.

[Miki]
"I think I get the picture."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Misato]
"Do you think you'd like to join?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, I think it'll be okay. Right, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"Well, our teacher said we had to join, so..."

[Misato]
"Oh, you can't be forced to join. If you don't want
to, you can refuse."

[Taichi]
"Oh, nooo! We need flowers for the office!"

[Misato]
"Apparently..."

I wonder if they'll buy it. They look so young,
maybe they will go for a bribe. Time for the
'welcome gift' plan!

[Taichi]
"I wonder if they'll buy it. They look so young,
maybe they will go for a bribe. Time for the
'welcome gift' plan!"

[Tomoki]
"You're thinking out loud again, Taichi."

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Ummm... Right, this is it!"

I pulled two objects from the Taichi Bag.

[Taichi]
"Member Miki Yamamba!"

[Miki]
"Sir, it's Yamanobe, sir!"

The first object was an autograph plate.

[Taichi]
"To you, I give you the autograph of that big star
and plastic-surgery pro, boy-loving smooth criminal
Michael--"

[Miki]
"A-an autograph plate?!"

[Taichi]
"Fan and worshiper, The Love Aristocrat Taichi
Kurosu's autograph!"

I forced it on to her.

[Miki]
"Oh."

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah!"
"Now, Member Kiri Sakura!"

[Kiri]
"Huh..?"

[Taichi]
"To you, I give the unforgotten
Big Man of baseball, Babe Ruth--"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Taichi doll!"

[Misato]
"There was no connection at all there."
"Not at all. Not in the slightest."

As you could tell from her glasses (really?), Mimi
was a stickler for the rules.
She was clearly bothered by the confusion.

[Tomoki]
"I get it. Since the reaction was so poor, you just
wanted it to end it there."

[Taichi]
"Hey, Kiri. That doll... It's okay if you keep it
with you always, clutching it close as company in
the long, tear-filled nights."

[Kiri]
"..."

Since she didn't reach for it, I hung it by its
thread from her neck.

[Miki]
"Did you make it yourself?"

[Taichi]
"But of course."

[Sakuraba]
"...What a hard nut to crack."

[Miki]
"For a peanut expert, you really are a nutcase!"

[All 3]
"Whoa!!!"

Sakuraba, Tomoki and I looked at each other.
That was a really good one.

[Taichi]
"Passed."

[Tomoki]
"I guess."

[Sakuraba]
"Nice."

I gave her a thumbs-up.

[Miki]
"Um...Oh, thanks?"

[Kiri]
"Ick..."
"I can't get this off?!"

Kiri tried to throw the doll away.

[Taichi]
"Waaait!"

[Kiri]
"Hmph."

She looked guilty.

[Taichi]
"Were you going to throw it away?
You were, weren't you!"

I felt triumphant.

[Taichi]
"You can't just throw away a gift that someone gave
you."

[Kiri]
"What are you talking about?"

[Taichi]
"It's a super important item!"
"So it's impossible to discard!"

[Kiri]
"It's cursed...?"

[Miki]
"Agh! So this autograph is, too?!"

Miki tried to throw the autograph out the window.
A mysterious voice called out.

[Miki]
"What?!"

[Taichi]
"Bwahahahaha!"

[Tomoki]
"Are you some kind of wizard?"

[Misato]
"Weren't they supposed to be welcome gifts, not
welcome curses?"

The front and back doors opened simultaneously.

[Shinkawa]
"Hey guys! Did Kiri come?"

[Touko]
"Taichi! I asked you to wait! Why'd you leave me
behind?"

Double visitors!

[Misato]
"Oh, welcome!"
"We have two visitors! I'll bring some cold tea."

She hurried to the refrigerator.

[Sakuraba]
"Sorry, Club Leader. The fridge is empty."

[Misato]
"Oh..."
"I'll just go buy some then, so keep them here!"

[Taichi]
"Roger!"

[Touko]
"Oh, um, no, that's okay, really..."

[Misato]
"I mean it!"

As she flapped her arms, she disappeared in the
hallway.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka, what are you doing here?"

[Shinkawa]
"Just came by to greet everyone...since a family
member is joining this club, after all."

[Kiri]
"You don't need to. Go home."

She tried to push him out.

[Tomoki]
"Hey, you want to join too?"

[Shinkawa]
"Um, I'm on the baseball team."

[Miki]
"Wait, is there a baseball team?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's just three guys playing board games all day."

[Miki]
"That's so funny..."

[Taichi]
"This school is pretty funny in general."

[Touko]
"Now, Taichi! Why are you ducking out on me?"

[Taichi]
"Your items can be passed on to other people, you
know!"

[Miki]
"Um, Kirihara, here you are!"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

Accepted.

[Touko]
"Ew, what is this? I can't let go of it! Is this
glue?!"

She waved her hand wildly but it wouldn't come off.

[Touko]
"What is going on here?!"

[Taichi]
"Don't keep performing the 'throw away' command. The
system message is irritating."

[Touko]
"I have no idea what you mean, I can't hear any
message."

[Taichi]
"You just have to give it to someone."

[Touko]
"Fine, then you take some responsibility and get
this thing off me!"
"Why not?!"

[Taichi]
"You can't give items to non-party members."
"You and I aren't in the same party, so it can't be
transferred."

Touko's became speechless and her mouth was moving
like a goldfish.

[Touko]
"Wh-whaaaat?!"

[Taichi]
"You'll just have to give in and join the club."

[Touko]
"Grrrrrah!"

[Kiri]
"It's fine, just hurry up and go home! You're
embarrassing me!"

[Shinkawa]
"I'm just worried about you! You're so helpless!"

[Kiri]
"I'm going to do just fine! Go home, I'm okay!"

[Sakuraba]
"Man, it sure is lively today."

Sakuraba muttered, standing by himself.

[Tomoki]
"Hey, you got the bottle off!"

[Sakuraba]
"The power of soapy water, my man."

Mimi came running back, holding a tray with cups.

[Misato]
"There wasn't any tea, so I brought some cups of
water!"

[Taichi]
"How pointless!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahah!"

People laughing, people fighting.
It was so festive!
I liked this environment.
This is what memories should be.

[Taichi]
"Oh no! Everyone look!"

Everyone's eyes turned on me.

[Taichi]
"There's a streaker!"

I threw my clothes off.

[Tomoki]
"It's you!"

I got kicked.
I grabbed onto Touko's hips.

[Touko]
"Ahhhh!"

[Taichi]
"You're a little thin. I can feel your bones. You
should try putting on some flesh."

[Touko]
"Hyaaaa!"

It was a battle cry.

[Taichi]
"Ugh!"

I collapsed into Kiri's arms.

[Kiri]
"A guy touched me!"

[Taichi]
"HAHAH!"

[Miki]
"Woo hoo!"

[Taichi]
"Nooooooo?!"

[Touko]
"Miyasumi, would you like to play?"

[Misato]
"Huh? Oh, b-but..."

[Touko]
"If you let him hit the ground, you lose."

What am I? A ball now?

[Misato]
"Oh my!"
"L-like this?"

[Taichi]
"Hiiiyaaa!"

[Tomoki]
"Oh, that last one was a doozy."

[Sakuraba]
"Taichi's special service..."

[Miki]
"Such a gentleman!"

It was fun.
It was all so much fun.
A really great memory.
I would never want to forget it.
Or so I prayed.
