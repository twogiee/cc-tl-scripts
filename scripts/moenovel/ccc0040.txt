Tomoki was there.
He was peeping into the nurse's office.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki."

When I called out to him, his back jolted in
surprise.

[Tomoki]
"A-ah, it's you, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"I didn't know you were at school."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, uh, just stopped by... Come here for a sec."

[Taichi]
"Oh?"

He took me away from the nurse's office.

[Tomoki]
"I suppose here will do."

[Taichi]
"Why all the way over here?"

[Tomoki]
"It's nothing..."

He mumbled.

[Taichi]
"How goes your peace-keeping efforts?"

[Tomoki]
"Life Maintenance Club. What can I say?"
"You doing okay on food, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Well enough for now, I suppose."
"Just have to hold on for a week."

[Tomoki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Just talking to myself."
"Got business in the nurse's office?"

Tomoki's face stiffened.

[Tomoki]
"N-no."

Why did he stutter?

[Taichi]
"I can see that you're hiding something."

[Tomoki]
"You can see that I'm not."

[Taichi]
"Nurse's office, Tomoki, after school, virgin...
The conclusion these four things lead me to is..."

It was time to play detective.

[Tomoki]
"Nah, it has nothing to do with my virginity."

[Taichi]
"Perplexing. Times like these call for
meta-reasoning."

[Tomoki]
"You're saying strange things again."

[Taichi]
"My multiple world elaboration reasoning skill!"
"This technique allows me to think of the infinite
possible choices for a situation and choose the best
one... Just like a quantum computer."

[Tomoki]
"So...just taking a wild guess?"

[Taichi]
"I'll need sugar to activate that sort of thought
process. Please give me snacks."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Give me gum. Give me chocolate."

[Tomoki]
"But you've always got candy on you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"That's my emergency supply for when my blood sugar
levels drop."

[Tomoki]
"What are you, diabetic?"

Tomoki fished through his pocket.
If anyone had food right now, it would be him.
Actually...now...Tomoki himself was food!
...What the hell...

[Tomoki]
"Here."

He really did have gum and chocolate.

[Taichi]
"You're really something, aren't you?"

[Tomoki]
"What do you mean? You said you wanted it, didn't
you?"

[Taichi]
"This should satisfy my oh-so-special brain."

[Tomoki]
"???"

Gum and chocolate.
I shoved them both into my mouth.

[Tomoki]
"Eww."

[Taichi]
"They taste good together."

[Tomoki]
"Really?"

He was shocked.

[Taichi]
"Going back to my line of reasoning..."
"Are you injured?"

Tomoki seemed taken aback.
His face suddenly seemed sarcastic.

[Tomoki]
"Yeah...injured..."
"Serves them right..."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Tomoki]
"Oh, nothing. See you around."

He left.

[Taichi]
"Hmm."

I swallowed the gum and chocolate.
I was the type who liked to eat gum.

[Taichi]
"Seemed like his heart was sick more than anything."
