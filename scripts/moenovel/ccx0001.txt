[Sakuraba]
"Hey, Taichi."

Wha, Sakuraba?

[Sakuraba]
"Here, the script."

What script?

[Sakuraba]
"You're the DJ, right?"

I'm...a DJ?
I guess I am.

[Miki]
"I can't wait to hear you DJ."

What the?

[Kiri]
"And I'll be happy when you screw up."

Of course, she would.

[Sakuraba]
"So, how's the script?"

Not bad, I guess.
The contents...I didn't get. Even though I could
read, I didn't understand.

[Touko]
"Why are you messing around? Do it right, okay?"

Touko...

[Touko]
"What's with that face? Not into it?"

[Miki]
"Like, no love-love?"

[Kiri]
"Love-love."

[Touko]
"Did you say something, freshmen?"

[Miki]
"Whoops, it was nothing."

[Kiri]
"Yeah, it was totally nothing about love-love."

[Touko]
"You want me to cut you in half?"

[Miki]
"Ahah hah. Help me, I'm going to be cut!"

[Kiri]
"Help us, please."

Uh... These two...

[Touko]
"Whose side are you on, Taichi?"

[Tomoki]
"Oh, here we go! Wow, disaster avoided!"

[Sakuraba]
"What happened? Bad connection?"

[Tomoki]
"Nope, just disconnected. That's why I've been
telling them to buy new cables here."

[Misato]
"But if we do that, we won't be able to afford that
BBQ place!"

[Tomoki]
"Which do you think is more important, sis?"

Huh, sister?
Did you just call her sis?

[Tomoki]
"Arg, you guys are all so loud! I'm doing this
myself."

So warm...
What a warm world.

[Yusa]
"Tomoki, I can't help but, I'll cheer you on."

Yusa...
She was a member of the broadcasting club,
wasn't she?

[Youko]
"Taichi, your uniform is messed up."
"This shows that you're not prepared."

Youko...

[Youko]
"All right, I'll fix it. We don't want Mutsumi to get
embarrassed, right?"

Wow, that takes me back.
But.
The memory was fairly gentle.
And fairly strict.

[Sakuraba]
"I really wanna go out on an adventure... 
I guess will go on one"

[Tomoki]
"No, you're not..."

[Miki]
"I was just thinking, where do you get the money for
your trips?"

[Sakuraba]
"The best kind of traveler finds a way..."

[Miki]
"It's hard for me to imagine..."

[Touko]
"Can't fool me. Sakuraba's family treats him like a
prince. He's probably loaded."

[Miki]
"Agh!"

[Kiri]
"Loaded?"

[Misato]
"You're suspended, Sakuraba."

[Sakuraba]
"Why?"

[Touko]
"And you're not old enough to get a hotel room."

[Misato]
"Okay, Pekke, are you ready?"

[Miki]
"It's your first time as a DJ...will you screw it
up?"

[Kiri]
"It's gonna be a train wreck."

[Tomoki]
"They're really expecting the worst from you."

[Touko]
"Okay...do well then."

[Sakuraba]
"Give it your all."

[Yusa]
"Can't wait."

[Youko]
"Give it all you've got."

Yeaaah.
This is good.
I'm satisfied.
My nerves had been calmed, but...
I couldn't get over how it was possible to be so
happy.
Right, everyone?
Time to screw around like crazy, right?
Then I woke up, and it was already noon.

[Taichi]
"Mm..."

I had stayed over at the school.
I should have went back home like a normal person.
But it was hard to get all prepared.
Misato was so responsible.

[Taichi]
"Okay, time to do it today too!"

I couldn't help blurting that out.
Sometimes if I didn't say what was on my mind, I'd
start to forget words.
Anyway, it was time to begin operations.
...
Then it was time to stop.

[Taichi]
"So hungry, man."

I wasn't getting lunch from Youko...
Everything had to be made myself.
Outside of the nasty curry rolls the school makes,
there were croquette rolls as well.
Surely a trip into town for food was still on the
table.
I looked around.
There were curry roll wrappers everywhere.
And as appetizing as it looked, I didn't feel like
eating the croquette roll.
The hallways were silent.
The club activity was silent.
The days were filled with silence.
Just what I wanted...
A heart at peace.
A world where I couldn't hurt others.
There was nothing much that I could do... 
No way to make sense of the world.
All I could do was live my truth without needing
to worry about doing better.
I could live honestly.
A youthful life with friends.
I had my chance in a world like that before but
failed.
That was one reason why I ended up in this distorted
reality.
This was like being an RPG character on the net with
my knowledge and speed levels set to 99.
All others were set to 1.
Either way, I was a tough cookie.
Tough since I was never really able to find a good
balance, I never could tell what was correct.
That's me...
But now...
Now I can live peacefully.

[Taichi]
"This brings back so many memories..."

I looked in the classroom.
I had no reason to.

[Miki]
"\\\"

[Kiri]
"\\\"

[Miki]
"\\\"

[Kiri]
"\\\"

The two were chatting...
They were always together and depended on each
other...
One always acting as a substitute for the other.
One always using the other as a tool.
It was a cruel composition.
One that went to the extreme.
They came in contact rarely.
Discovered happiness in that contact.
But would they be able to find the same happiness
back in the real world?
In order for Miki to appreciate Kiri, she needs
much more experience living.
Kiri on the other hand, she might need time to be
released from the guilt she is carrying.

[Taichi]
"..."

I should stop.
Even if I think about them now, I have no way of
contacting them.
No way to interact with them.
All types of communication were gone.
Then.
The two came running towards me.

[Taichi]
"..."

Making noise, running around, and disappearing.
A wind seemed to pass by containing their essence.
Like a lingering fragrance.
Even though all of it was a hallucination.
The gate will never close.
There was no reason to close it.
Since, there is no one that would be hurt.
Of course, there's no one here to get angry for me
for missing school.

[Taichi]
"..."

I just happened to come here.
The store that I am familiar with.
I picked up a few foods and drinks.
For some reason in this world, the food and drinks
don't go bad.

[Taichi]
"..."

I decided to leave memos on the wall.
Just like I do every week.
"--Month, --Day, got bread (110 yen) + Cup Ramen
(180 yen) + green tea can (100 yen)"
A meaningless action.
But some work should be done when acquiring 
food and drinks.
If you abandon that it's like putting yourself in
position to die slowly.
Either way, the situation will never change.
How sarcastic.
I decided to eat in my classroom.
Touko was always at this classroom.
This was the only place she could be at.
Stood up straight, with her chin down.
She always walked with dignity.
But once she receives a helping hand, which she was
not used to, she was easily corrupted.
Touko was dangerous when she was corrupted.
As soon as someone was kind to her, she would let
her guard down.
Her awkwardness made it hard for her to be around
people.
No matter how much you trust a person, a certain
distance should be kept.
Once a person is too dependent, it would be hard for
them to live.
Because you'd end up destroying each other.
If they are fine with that, then the can keep
depending on one another.
I don't want that.
Even though it did happen between Youko and I.
For some reason, I just loved still beauty.
It was like admiration.
I wonder if she's crying in the other world.
No one to depend on.
I guess I betrayed her twice.
...Can she take that?
A heavy sigh came out.

[Touko]
"\\\"

I could hear her lisping, high-handed words again.
Only within myself.
The club room.
It used to be the gathering spot.
Of course, they aren't here.
The relationship of us three was pretty good.
Just a normal relationship. Or close.
Thus, it was a miracle for me.

[Taichi]
"..."

There was nothing to say.
Every time I think about this precious relationship
that I let go, it made feel heart broken and left me
speechless.
I just stood there,
Club activity starts again.
No matter how hard you try, it's hard to prepare
alone.
I knew I had to pace myself.
If I really tried, it would be over in three days.
I've done it so many times.
I knew what I was doing.
I had established a process.
So, I purposely took time on the process.
I took a lot of detours.
Different routes than Misato.
In a way though, she took her own detours.
It made me think.
Ignoring the efficient process and doing it the
inefficient way.
But Misato who supported the club alone, should know
the fundamentals.
The relationship within her family.
And them disappearing.
This was a good enough reason to not face reality.

[Taichi]
"I guess I'll have to handle club activities alone."

I said out loud.
Another day of hard working.

[Taichi]
"It's getting late..."

The evening.
The life of earth was frozen.
Yet, the sky kept its daily routine.
As if it were a virtual image of summer left behind
in a mirror.
Following the real image but disappearing at the
speed of light.
Now was a moment of free time.
It may just be second in space history but weeks for
humanity.

[Taichi]
"...Time to go home."

I knew that it wouldn't rain, but I still put the
equipment back in the shed.

[Taichi]
"Good work today!"

Nobody was there but I still said good bye and hit
the road back home.
On the way home, I went by the shopping street to
pick up some food.

[Taichi]
"Phew..."

Home sweet home.
It didn't matter, even if humanity didn't exist.
Fixed my own food.
Cooked my own rice in the yard.
Seasoned it a bit, put the scraps in a trash bag.
No need to put out the trash.
A trash bag would last me a week.
Smell of burnt food in the evening breeze.

[Taichi]
"Oh no!"

I rushed to the garden.

[Taichi]
"Ugh...it's all black."

No way I can eat this.
I had to fix another batch of rice.
Some time ago, I burned down my house accidentally.
That was rough.
Since it felt uneasy in another person's house,
I stayed at the club room.
I should be more careful.
Everything I did would be meaningless if put myself
on fire.
...
A late dinner.
By the time I was done eating, it was dark.

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

I felt an ill feeling.
Will it come tonight?
I had to relax and stay calm.
So, I decided to write in my journal.
It's important to keep your hands moving.
Especially, when your heart feels a little broken.

[Taichi]
"Um...today, I did..."

I wrote down my club activity.

[Taichi]
"And then..."

Then my pen stopped.
Nothing.
Nothing would occur.
Not a chance of it.

[Taichi]
"...So."

So?
Why am I even keeping a journal?
I closed the journal. It made me feel sick.
I looked for something to do.
I lit a candle and tried reading.
I couldn't stay focused.
There's no way I can read next week's comics.
I stomach started feeling ill.
Damn.
Tomorrow, I'll go to the book store and get some
full sets of finished comics.

[Taichi]
"Gah! Time for bed!"

I jumped in bed.

[Taichi]
"Time to sleep!"

I tried raging for a bit.

[Taichi]
"Woohoo! Woohoo!"

I tried swimming on my bed.

[Taichi]
"... Huff, huff..."

I'm beat.
The wind came in.
No worries of bug, so I left the window open.
A cool summer.
I appreciated that.

[Taichi]
"Now that I'm tired, I can sleep."

I should count some sheep.

[Taichi]
"One scapegoat, two scapegoats..."

The sheep were too boring, so I tried goats.
Something felt weird.
But it felt totally correct.

[Taichi]
"..."

No one to talk to, no one to receive affection.
But there was a me who kind of hoped for
it a little.
Her, who was always there.
What selfish thing to say.
I started walking energetically to forget
all regrets.
Off to school.

[Taichi]
*whistle*

I couldn't really whistle this morning.

[Taichi]
"Time to screw around again."

I announced it and got to work.
I took out all the equipment and put them in their
places.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

I finished my work up to certain point.
I went inside the tent.
I'm not going to sleep.
I was just going to lay down for bit.

[Taichi]
"Zzz."

...

[Taichi]
"Whoa?!"

I totally fell asleep!
Not doing anything for an entire day, wasn't good.
Anguish spun in my mind.
I had to hurry and get to work.

[Taichi]
"Ouch!"

I cut my finger.

[Taichi]
"I can't get hurt! Oh no!"

There are no doctors.
Well, even if I got an untreatable disease...
Nothing could be done anyway.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

I was annoyed.
I got a water pistol and shot out the fence.

[Taichi]
"Pew!"

The stream of water scattered and was blown
in the breeze.

[Taichi]
"Oooh, a rainbow."

A small rainbow.
It decorated the evening.

[Taichi]
"Whoa."

I relaxed a bit.
The Bumpy Road.
What could I recall...
Yutaka and Nanaca.
Out of two, especially...

[Taichi]
"Nanaca."

Just saying her name made my heart clench a bit.
Why did she stay as my ally till the end?
Till the end?
Well, that's not decided yet.
Only...she just doesn't show up anymore.
With Nanaca's personality, she would have settled
things before leaving.
If she loves someone, she'll knock them off their feet
telling them all about it.
...Maybe that's a bit too far.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Nanaca!!"

I tried calling her.
It felt like she would just come out of nowhere
on her bike.
It felt like it.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

Reading.
Only comics.
Time passed at a slow pace.
I just have to enjoy a leisurely life.
No need to live desperately.
If you live desperately, you explode.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah..."

Comics are interesting.
If I had something to say about it, the content of
it was too lively.
It had a lot of characters.
That made feel a little depressed.

[Taichi]
"In Saitama, in the mountains."
"Distressed`"

I improvised a song and kept working.
I looked up anything I didn't know.
I burnt through a lot of time.
There were a lot of books I took from the
club room and the library on the roof.
It was tedious putting them back, so I just shoved
them in the shed.

[Taichi]
"...However, if we wanted to send SOS, there was a
lot more efficient ways to do so..."

If there was no signal, it would have been better to
use a handheld radio.
Misato knew.
That all humanity was gone.
As a result, she got everything necessary for the
club activity including useless things.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

I noticed I had walked all the way to the shopping
street.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

I had become a night walker.
Well, it wasn't correct saying, I had noticed.

[Taichi]
"Time to go back."

I was tired of wandering around.

[Taichi]
"Good night."

I said to myself.
I tucked myself in bed.

[Taichi]
"..."

I couldn't sleep.
I looked at the world from the roof.
So many days spent up here.
And the mountains, and the sea.
I couldn't imagine anymore what was out there.
The feeling of the "city" I rarely went to.
The feeling had faded and was nearly forgotten.
Probably, it was because I didn't care about it
much.
I made me realize, I only had my eyes on the people.

[Taichi]
"Sleep, sleep, sleep!"
"Sleep, sleep, sleep!"
"Sleep, sleep, sleep!"
"Sleep, sleep, sleep!"
"Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep,
sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep!"

When I woke up, I was alone.
I was lonely.
I read that all humans were lonely by true nature.
All living things are.
But, humans are the only ones that realize it.
It made me think, that insects were the perfect form
of living creatures.

[Taichi]
"Hm..."

I had lacked sleep.
But, I still had to go to school.
If I do something depraved, I'll only regret it.
There was something else about loneliness.
People always felt pressure from others.
It's good to leave that pressure sometimes.
If you repress it too long, your heart gets twisted.
If you are nothing, oneself could spread forever.
But nobody in this world has such a dense self.
If you keep diluting yourself, it's almost the same as
nothing.
I can't imagine that.
To become one with the world.
Doesn't that make you lonely?
If you become one with the world, would you be able
to remember who you are?
Why... Why did people have to have a heart...

[Taichi]
"..."
"..."
"..."

When I tried to enter the school, it hurts.
My heart hurts.
It was box of nothing.
It used to be a jack-in-the-box.
Nothing now.
A box of abyss.
It was terrifying.
That's what I felt.
Because before, I had close people that I could come
in contact with.
I forced myself in the school.
Aha!
I could barely speak.
It was difficult to make a sentence.

[Taichi]
"Okay...then..."

No, too hoarse.
Speaking is difficult.
It's pretty hard when you try it.
Emotions come in any subjective way.
(Laughs)
Like this.
(Cries)
And so on.
(Anger)
And so on.
ij
Ah, I know that one well.
Kind of reminds me of a European knight.
My hair changed color because I'm too fired up.
I even completed my murdering technique within
a week.
If I asked a mathematician, they would combine
the two to make Marie Antoinette. 
*New Real Time Monologue technique in use.
When I was a kid, I thought it was Marianne Toinette.
I even called Angkor Wat, Angko Ruwat.
I called a turtleneck a totalneck.
The stone age city in Orkney was the scone-age
sitting Inorkney.
Geez, who cares.
Heh.
Anyway, to the hallway.
No one there.
Nothing there.
Nothing moving.
Cats are sensitive to movement.
That's their way.
It was my way too.
I used to say, "there's no means" instead of "there's
no point."
If you don't know the means, you don't know the
ends.
If I say that, Tomoki would say, "Don't say stuff
like that... a programmer might believe you."
Tomoki was a good guy.
I really loved this club.
Let me go to the club and feel almighty today too.
I have so many memories of Tomoki.
We two and Sakuraba set up such a fun system ().

[Taichi]
"..."
"..."
"...ah..."

"That" was about to explode.
"That" was only "that," and was an indescribable
"thing."
"That" was only "that," "this" was only "this."
That's why I swallowed it.
Swallowed. Swallowed.
Swallowed it seven times.
Swallowed more.
Thanks for the meal.
My heart was screaming.
I'm full.
Inside of me, it's sitting and won't come out.
Shut up.
I was always late for club.
It's Friday already.
Underestimating too much?
So, I decided to work.
A new campaign for me.

[Taichi]
"Roar."

Five minutes later, I got tired of think all the
detail little stuff.
I guess this campaign is over.
It's fine. Time for another.
If the first finished there was always a second.
Oh?
What's going on there was no first in the first
place.
Wow, strange choice of words by me.
The water pierced through the orange sphere
floating in the sky.
No, it's not a sphere.
It might just be circle.
A new theory of the sun being a flat circle.
This motionless world. Something happen damn it.
Seeing the sun go up and down and that being it
isn't enough.
No way of getting it.
It's a light weight class celestial object that can't
even be a black hole.
I felt like I lost the battle.
Come on. Learn from Scorpio V861.
I want it to just go for broke.
I want to see a white dwarf.
Ah, Sakuraba once said.
I wonder if the crime of conscience was not being
happy in my role.
I wonder if it's like a target I put to shoot with
the thought crime of dissatisfaction with the place
I was put.
Look at me.
A twig, twig!
With a twig! Twig!
I demolished the fence.
A fake twig is here!
I can't see it!
Wow, perfect!
Then it fell!
That fake twig was pulled down to the earth,
pulled down I'm saying!
I demolished the fence with a giant plier like object.
I'll call it gravity!
What a discovery!
The beginning and end of the Age of Discovery.
The front of the cut fence glided awkwardly.
Millions of words.
My brain swam.
Synapses fired.
Yahooo!
Touko attacked.
We met, separated, and met again. No room for
emotion.
I can't even search for my mother.
I want to know ********.
****...
*******?
**!
****************************************************
**************************.
*.
Then I defeated her.
Sorry, Touko!
My heart throbbed heavily.
I could feel blood.
I had to release it.
I have to shine.
To recover dishonor, I seduced Kiri.
To relinquish honor, I continued to seduce her.
I continued to seduce her.
I tried to seduce her as best I could.
Such a perfect seduction.
But I never got a favorable response.
Why?
Because Kiri was all red.
I regret it.
Damn, damn it all!
Worse than regretting not doing it, is doing it and
regretting!
One person can't fix it.
Okay, Kiri, respond to my feelings!
I expressed my feelings using a monologue.
Monologue is a long speech by one person, but in
video game terms it's completely different so if you
want to make a big deal on small things be my guest.
Well, I don't like admitting things.
I'm incomplete about it.
Happy trail is better.
Yeah, okay.
So then.
A monologue from my happy trail.
Awesome.
You could say it makes me have a galactic Milky Way.
Nothing like that actually.
Heh.
Just another 'Heh'.
Better than 'Meh'.
So, Kiri, how about it?
Kiri said with a serious tone.

[Kiri]
"... Do you care what gender your fried chicken is?"

Yeah...I do! I really do!
Well, too bad.
The grenade exploded.
We all died.
You fought well with your weapon, but there were
many scorpions and it was impossible to prevent from
being stung.
So, your consciousness became weak, and the
scorpions enjoyed feasting on the human flesh.
Your adventure is over.
In order to stop the plan of the Morlock Warlock,
please resume your adventure from the first
paragraph.
May the goddess of luck protect you on your next
adventure.
Oh my...sorry my thoughts got mixed up with a book I
read in the past.
I guess it's impossible. Being alone.
Now hand the camera over to special agent Youko!
Whoaaa, she's there!
Oh my god, she's looking at me me me!
That's Ichihara from official training.
No...
That's way different.
Completely different.
So different, it seems totally excellent.
A flawless person, what about that?
With a person with very little flaws, you could just
say it in words.
A normal person would die 100 times but this person?
They could live through it 200 times.
Yeah, I've seen it! It's possible for a protagonist
in the 90-minute movies from Hollywood!
The last 10 minutes has the highest potential.
I thought about it, the anti-movie.
A story where you sleep till the last ten minutes,
and be powered up to defeat the enemy.
I thought of another chain of reasoning.
A story that begins with all people disappearing.
This one.
It fit me perfectly.
My own hymn.
Which is worse? Looking down on others, or doing
what I want to make myself better?
Pisses you off, right?
I asked the question.

[Youko]
"Rescued princess bride."

So philosophical. Geez. No way to win.
Okay, Camera!
Who to hang out with?
Okay, Mimi then.
She's sleeping!
She's awake?!

[Misato]
"Lack of morals, too much individualism, violations
of human rights, all the things that are a hazard to
a kid in this day and age!"
"Can we youth help each other and build ourselves up
together? I think that the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting
Club can be the answer that we seek!"

Wehhheee!
That was huge.
Good job, Mimimi.
The weakness of people is soft, like big boobs.
That's why I really like it.
To be honest, I don't like it.
And loving is just something set in place.
Sorry.
No need to sulk!
Did you really hate being called Mimimi that much?
Super cute, though.
*tsk*
And then Miki.
I needed her to comfort me.
Hey. Hey.
Hey! Hey!
I'm multiplex broadcasting.
Just this monologue.
But, it's a product full of awesome strength.
Is this alright?
Do you forgive me?
Am I recognized?
Do you put me in the adult section?

[Miki]
"Graow-mraow-graow."

Cat talk!
Geez, never completed a course.
No mutual understanding.
I'm just looking at her underwear.
I will keep doing so.
I stared at her underwear for 14 hours.
But it only lasted 4 seconds.
Thanks, Miki.
Goodnight.
After playing around, it was time for recreation.
Work hard at club.
Hard days, hard nights.
Working on a routine.
All people are on a routine.
What's wrong about that?

[Miki]
"It's so boring, I'll go nuts."

Wha?

[Yusa]
"No! You can't do that!"

What can't I do?
Sky.
And so...
Ground, far below.
And then...
Then it exploded.

[Taichi]
"Ahhhhhhhhhhggggghhhhhhh!!"

From a sea of expressions, I reached my hand out.
But there was nothing to grab.
My mind seemed to flip (like takoyaki) back to
the present world.
My mind is now in this world.

[Taichi]
"Huff, huff, huff!"

I was about jump off the edge of the fence I broke.
My fingers held on strongly to the steel mesh.
It was a close one.
The hole in the fence was carved like a door.
I did it. I remember.
My memory was all scattered about, mixed with all
kinds of expressions, which made me lose my mind.
My fingertips were white as plaster.
Because all my strength was in it.
I pulled my center of gravity back from the fence.
Now I'm safe. I won't fall.
My fingers are gripping the fence. It was hard to
let go.
A slight pain.
I turned my hand over and I could see the veins
interwoven in my hands.

[Taichi]
"What was I..."

I can't believe I attempted suicide.
I can't just die.
I killed so many and stayed alive.

[Taichi]
"Isn't that right, Youko?"

Even though I called her name, she didn't appear.
I held myself.
I was cold.
I just couldn't stand myself.
I ran.
Inside the school.

[Taichi]
"Ahhhhhhhhhh!!"

I ran.
People!
People!
Somewhere, people!

[Taichi]
"Miki, Kiri!"

No one here.
I kicked over a desk.
Desk after desk after desk.
Textbooks tumbled to the ground.
The two weren't here.
Fear.
No one here in this space.
I ran away as fast as I could.
A long space.
The fear of being attacked in a tight place.
The enemy being the abyss.
It's all around me.
Covered me completely.
If I stay like this I would lose myself again.
I went down the stairs, to the second-year
classroom.
Touko's room.
It was a small little fort, isolated from
everything.
But she's not there.
Her strong will left with her.
It would have been nice if a little bit of it was
left here.

[Taichi]
"Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaah!"

I stepped over the threshold to the tiger's den.
I wandered around town.
Looking for anyone.
In the remains of this intersected world, I wasn't
sure if people even existed.
But, I wanted to continue the search.
I wanted people to be here.

[Taichi]
"Ah...huff...huff..."

I checked every house I could.
Half day of craziness.
I kept searching.
I fell at the gate, exhausted.

[Taichi]
"...Damn it...not one person."

No matter how much I searched.
No one was here.
But all the rushing around, made me calm down a bit.
Maybe because the mind rests after hard exercise?

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

Of course.
I rushed to the mountains.
I couldn't believe it.
Nothing?
That gate or gap, whatever it was, was completely gone.

[Taichi]
"...This can't be."

Didn't it exist for more than a thousand weeks?
Maybe tens of thousands.

[Taichi]
"Why did it disappear...?"

Resentment.
Despair.
Indescribable emotions.
Pain.
Restrained within my heart, I stood there.

[Taichi]
"Why..."

I wanted to run away.
Anyone would feel that way.
Even I would feel that way.
Mimi...
Tomoki...
Kiri...
Miki...
Youko...
I couldn't make fun of them.
The gate no longer exists.
Even if I want to, I couldn't return.
There was nothing to correct this world.
Alone.
In this intersecting world.
Only one point of intersection.
The other currents continued to flow.

[Taichi]
"Oh, right..."

But this town of the abyss...it...
It passed its intersection.
If you see the letter X, you would understand.
Two lines with their own currents.
The intersecting happens instantly, but the current
doesn't stop.
Did I ride on one line of current?
No...not right.
This town was the remains.
The remains of an intersection.
"Reality" has passed, and the cross point became a
"fake."
This phenomenon is like two papers stapled
together.
I existed in both A and B worlds.
A convenient world created by patch work.
But the real world keeps flowing on.
This fake world remains for now, but it will
disappear one day.
Just like the connecting gate disappeared.
Or was it simply because my eyes just lost its
function, making me not able to see the gate
anymore.
When the sky disappears...what's going to happen to
me.

[Taichi]
"...Haha."
"Hahahah!"
"Bwahahahahahah!"

This laugh.
A blessing.
Until the gate disappears, I wonder how much time
passed.
It seems like it was pretty fast.
But it might have taken months and years.
Either way, I bore the burden,
When the place to flee seemed far, I fought it out.
And won.
That's the truth.

[Taichi]
"No place to run...just live...that's all."

That's fine.

[Taichi]
"It serves me right."

Serves you right, true me.
Just a useless person (myself) in a useless loop.

[Taichi]
"...Haha."

Inside me, millions of emotions intersected like
crosses.
Woven together like an imaginary tapestry.
Glimmering with a million colors.

[Taichi]
"Oh, um..."
"Uh..."
"..."

I screamed.
As loud as I can.
My vocal cords shook, and the sound broke through
the air.
This wasn't a voice.
It was sound.
With this phenomenon and my existence, there was
no other physical things occurring.
I could see the effect with my eyes.
My consciousness took shape.
The lace itself was beautifully woven, but with
eerie feelings.
When it shakes, you can see a filthy wasteland
through the holes.
This is me...
My eyes were catching the invisible.
All lies were now the truth to me.
This state...
An altered state.
A trance. Insight. Awakening. Divine revelation.
Spiritual experience. Call it whatever.
My mental state at the highest was connecting with
my subconscious.
I was cornered.
From the stress.
Hmmmm?
Struck like by an electric force, my consciousness
ached.
What's on my conscious side?
Intricate emotions and distances, deep layers of
knowledge.
Informing about a profound consciousness.
This is not correct...
My awareness began to disintegrate.
No.
I didn't fall into an altered state.
Knowledge...
The workings of my brain are not that confused.
Just seeing the different abilities I have,
and the vestiges of the present time.
In other words?
Knowledge...
Altered state. Abnormal consciousness. The
self-directed thoughts and emotions from the heart,
seen as a religious experience.
Exploding with understanding.
My thoughts turned into a physical phenomenon,
pinned me down.
A mysterious connection.
Into one line.
Connected the beginning and end, to form a circle.
A circle.
Circle of understanding.
My consciousness.
From the beginning, altered.
From that day.
I completely changed.
Until today, always.
The bypass to the abyss could make explode any
minute.
Always connected.
I couldn't control my feelings within me.
My instincts were scattered through out.
My logic was going crazy.
When nihilism is your thoughts, you try to
reason it away with your consciousness.
Like the sewage being covered by mud.
But even that resorting to logic doesn't destroy the
void.
And so...
It's stuck like tar in the oldest of memories.
It's an altered state, an ancient tale.

[Nanaca]
"I'm sorry Taichi."

Why her?
I met her when this loop began.
Why is she here in my oldest memories?
I never lost my memor...explosion.

[Nanaca]
"Taichi, that's your name."
"I'm sorry, that I'm too spontaneous of a girl."
"Because, I fell in love with your papa."
"Your papa lived to his fullest."
"He knew that life was short..."
"Also..."
"My life isn't long either."
"I'm sorry..."
"I think you'll go through a lot from now Taichi."
"Papa who is gone, and I...will not be able to
support you."
"But..."
"I love you, Taichi."
"I really, really love you. I'm glad you were born."
"If I could be reborn as someone else, I'd want to
give birth to you again."
"That's how much I love you."
"I'm sorry... This is the only thing I can leave you
with..."

[Taichi]
"..."

Tears.
I cried.
A flood of tears.
I cried so much...my eyes hurt.
This.
A memory...when I was born.
It's my memory...when...I was born...
I remembered it.
People can recall it if they try.
"I'm sorry... This is the only thing I can leave you
with..."
"I'm sorry... This is the only thing I can leave you
with..."
"I'm sorry... This is the only thing I can leave you
with..."
I want to remember.

[Taichi]
"Mother..."

I covered my face.
Emotions that I couldn't express.
Probably...emotions of a baby.

[Taichi]
"I remembered...my mother."

I thought my heart was worthless, but there was
something valuable there.
That feeling when you died from a long search of
someone and when looking back, the missing person
would give you a smile.
Like everything could be accepted.
Vertigo.
There was one more memory.
One more memory I fished out.
Darkness.
My childhood was with the darkness.
Nanaca... My mother would hold me in the darkness.
Saying nothing.
A mother and child in darkness.
I had no idea why.
For a long time.
She was sad and scared.
I could feel it.
No father.
He was probably dead.
I kind of understood that much.
I also understood I had no words for comfort.
Just my mother, holding me.
A young girl with no one to depend on.
Fighting against her fears within her.
Both of us unable to cry together.
I noticed that I could see my mother, even in the
darkness.
Few months after birth, the connection from my brain
to my visual cortex changed, so I was able to see
minute details with my vision.
In the darkness, my mother held me silently.
That caused a change in my body.
She was a captive to fear and had no knowledge.
The rod cells and the pyramidal cells at this time
were optimized but at this time the host was
recognized to be nocturnal.
The rod cells increased and were distributed.
The tapetum started to form at this time.
Perhaps duplication errors or the vitreous was
losing its transparency.
I couldn't tell.
As a result, the light entering my pupil reflected
and created a double layer.
Almost like a cat or a dog.
These eyes could sense motion better than still
objects.
Just like a cat playing with a small insect...
In the darkness, my mother kissed me often.
How did that influence me?
My subconscious only allowed me to remember that
much.
Of course.
My mother died.
She probably died after that.
That's why the Hasekuras took care of me.
Everything makes sense now.
Okay... What about the Nanaca I saw?
It couldn't be...
I shouldn't think about it.
She was an unconditional friend.
All the time, she would watch over me.
That's what I think.
Only the world should know the truth.
No need for me to know it.
She loved me, and that was enough for me.
After my tears came back, next came the
understanding.
You only needed people to be by your side.
Places, personalities, sexes, it didn't matter.
You just want them to be there.
People needed people to be by them.
You want to feel close to them.
The warm feeling of somebody being there.
People want that feeling.
So, people call for each other.
By phone. Words. Letters. Manners.
...By radio.
Someone please listen to me...
That's what they wished for.
Mimi was right.
It was an escape, but it was right.
I'm a person.
Ah, yes.
Unbelievable.
My deep consciousness would disturb me, causing me
to destroy other people.
I couldn't help it because my impulse would disturb
any kind of cooperation.
But I am a person.
I can stay alive.
With just this satisfaction, I can stay alive.
With the gate gone, the world might change.
This is the intersection.
If it's gone, the remains would stay beautiful.
The time of disappearance was coming.
I wonder, how much longer can it last?
Till next week?
The week after?
Next year?
Will it be before I die?
There's no way I was going to die.
If I die, this irreplaceable feeling will be destroyed.

[Taichi]
"...I'll live."

Live and fight.
Until the end.
That's what I want.
Before my own life ends, please.
I wish this sky would disappear.
Nanaca was smiling.

[Nanaca]
"I'm sorry... This is the only thing I can leave you
with..."

What is left is the stalest and most cliche words,
and a wish for the people.
So, I said.

[Taichi]
"Thank you. I'm fine now."

Nanaca responded.

[Nanaca]
"...Yeah!"

She congratulated me with a smile.
I was also able to understand who Nanaca was.
My heart achieved a transcendental peace.

[Taichi]
"..."

I stood there, alone.
In the woods, alone, by myself.
Silence.
Like I never experienced before.

[Taichi]
"My impulses...it's gone...?"

The uncontrollable impulse that I had was gone.
It was so quiet, I could only hear what was
happening inside my body.
I felt anxious.
I couldn't feel the strong ego of the tyrant that
haunted me.
I wondered if peace really came.
Maybe it's short dream.
Forlorn.
But this was normal.
Here, people developed feelings.
I put my hand on my chest.
Tightly.
I held myself.
What week is this, anyway?
Dozens, maybe tens of thousands.
Let me commemorate this one by calling it week X.
I was no longer a weapon.
This week, I became a person.
It took a while, and maybe it's meaningless.
But...tears fell from my eyes.
From being sad.
From being happy.
There was no word that could express these two
feelings together.

[Taichi]
"Hahaha. Hahaha."

I laughed, then cried.

[Taichi]
"Yahooooo!"

Next day. Roof. Club.

[Taichi]
"Okay! I'll do it!"

The antenna looked like some modernist art...
If I worked hard today, I can probably handle it.
Sunday.

[Taichi]
"It's ready..."

Somehow, in time.
Relief.
It's rough though because I only have half a day on
Sundays.
Anyway, complete.
A feeling of accomplishment.

[Taichi]
"Looks awesome..."

I looked at the sky.

[Taichi]
"...Right, Misato?"

Looking at the sun makes me sleepy.
Sleeping here would be trouble.
I must broadcast.
I sat down.
It was a dream.
Just an everyday club activity, living a normal
student life.
I just wanted us to have something to remember.
How satisfying...
I inhaled.
The summer-scented evening wind
carried it away like some kind of prank.
Time to start.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club."

Even if I knew it was a waste of time.
I would hang on to life.
And I spoke my words of power.
"Is anyone left out there?"
"If there is anyone...please listen."
I don't know what situation you're in now.
Maybe you're in despair.
Or having thoughts of sorrow.
Or maybe you're facing down death.
I will say this, to all people.
...Please live.
Just live.
Please keep living.
That's all I wish for.
If someone out there can hear my voice.
You're not alone any more.
Because in this instant you're listening to me.
Even if you're not aware of it.
It will be the connection between us.
I think so.
A person is born alone and dies alone.
Even if you make friends, you're actually alone.
Even if you meet others, you're not with others.
Living is about being alone.
It's important to act like you're not lonely to others.
That's why...other people exist.
Do you have memories with others?
That's important.
Don't ever forget it.
It is the only thing that would support you when you
face loneliness.
The ideal is someone to be close to you.
But now, that can't be ensured.
But, I am here.
Just as you are there.
I closed my eyes.
All those millions of thoughts.
This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club.
"Is anyone alive out there?"
I prayed.
See you next week.
The broadcast ended.
I stood up, turned the power off.
No time to clean up.
I had to rush to the shrine.
Then do it again.
Probably, these actions are meaningless.
But I will keep calling out.
With the cross of my heart, looking for the moment
of cross.
Over and over, through the weeks.
To tell people, "See you next week".
