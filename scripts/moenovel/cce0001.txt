Youko Hasekura came back to her room.

[Youko]
"..."

It was her home territory, but she didn't relax.
She slipped through towers of stacked books, threw
the bag on the couch, while plugging in her
equipment.
There were three sets of computers with monitors
covering a hundred square feet.
There was a cramped looking bench in an L shape
wrapped around the room.
Even though the computers were normally used for
surveillance, they were now useless except for one.
Because there was no one to watch.
Tech books filled the shelves that extended to the
ceilings.
There were books in Japanese, English, and
German.
She didn't had the reason to sort them since she
could read them all.
The books poured out from shelves, and there were
columns of books rising from the floor.
Perhaps she didn't touch them lately. It was covered
with a thin layer of dust.
You could see books about equipment and high-tech
machinery.
There were things all over the place, but it was a
room with purpose.
A room for a certain purpose.
It was an entertainment room, but for only one type
of entertainment.
A room to fulfill one's knowledge.
That was the purpose of the room.
She sat down in her chair to finish her daily routine.
She checked her email while reading the news.
Corruption of the government.
Juvenile crime.
Concealed malpractice.
The world never changes.
The increase in incidence of suicides.
From this page about suicide, to a bulletin board of
something else, Youko's eyes moved and stopped.
The term "radio" caught her attention.
The site was a nonsense one about the occult.
Voices of spirits from radios, voices of God, and so
on.
The voices had the power to stop committing suicide.
She lost interest.
She navigated to some other websites to check
investment information.
She moved mechanically.
Normally, she'd read the necessary texts and
fool around with the necessary machinery.
But today she had no plan.
Lately, a certain brand name was doing well in the
market. She adjusted some of her stocks.
Good to have capital.
It can be useful when you need it.
Same as strength.
She at least was done training today.
Any motion that could be automatically eliminated
helped Youko maintain herself.
That had been her purpose once.
To strengthen oneself for the outside world.
That's what she had thought when I had been in
Hasekura's mansion.
That's what she studied for.
But now her purpose had changed.
She had to half reset her body.
She now worked on her abilities to protect her
defenseless companion.
And he was lost.
Even the indication of him disappeared.
But in the mechanical movements that she continued
to make, what did Youko herself think about?
From her emotionless face, who could understand it?
She turned the computers off.
The room became black at once.
She simply sat in her chair.
Her assignment was done.
Nothing to do.
She looked at the clock. It was too soon to sleep.
Something caught her attention.
She looked at the only leisure object in her room.
It was a thin radio, as big as a card.
It was left turned on.
That frequency never had anything on it.
Sometimes, broadcasts from far away would mix in
the static.
That was all.

[Youko]
"..."

Youko sighed and consigned herself to this extra
time.
Certain amount of time had passed.
She slept lightly and awoke instantly.
She stared at the radio.
She could hear someone breathing deeply.
She remembered a small, unique, nostalgic thought.

[Taichi]
"This is...Gunjo Broadcasting Club..."

The impact shocked Youko.
She took the radio in hand.
That's all she could do.
The thought of recording it, didn't even come to
mind.

[Taichi]
"Is anyone alive out there?"

The radio had spoken.
There was no doubt about it.

[Youko]
"...Tai...chi?"

[Taichi]
"If there is anyone...please listen."

[Youko]
"Taichi."

But her voice didn't reach him.
She listened to the broadcast.

[Youko]
"..."

Her mouth fell open, as if her soul was about to
come out through her teeth.
Taichi's voice...through the radio. Breathing.
The broadcast was over in a flash.
The voice seemed to disappear.
And Youko just put her ear closer to the radio.
She liked hearing it.
It was pleasant.
It was a male.
As Taichi had said, Youko's feelings may have been
impure.
To pursue her goal, Youko loved walking on a set
path too much.
That love...was hard to watch.
But, it truly was a love.
Only, only Taichi had stirred up Youko's heart.
She wasn't perfectly complete.
Youko knew that.
Especially, when she was a child.
She had used that boy that longed for her, and has
distorted his emotions.
On the day of the slaughter, she was too weak to
kill anyone.
Weapon in hand, surrounded by corpses... All she
could do was stand there.
It was her first time to see others of no interest
be broken.
She only trembled by the ugliness of the corrupted
world.
Codependent, inter-bonded.
What should have been done?
Was there any way for her to be able to walk along
with Taichi?
She would have thought calmly without confusion.
However, now, she shivered like a powerless child.

[Youko]
"Ugggh..."

She sobbed.
She was mistaken.
Mistake-Mistake-Mistake-Mistake.

[Taichi]
"Until next week."

The broadcast was over.
She fell down and wept.

[Youko]
"Uhhhghhhhhh..."

She was filled with extreme regret.
It was the first time in her life she felt this.
An acute pain.
From the depths of her heart...
She felt she should have done better...

[Tomoki]
"Sis, your bath's ready..."

Tomoki Shima called to his sister, Misato, who was
in her disorganized room, in their maternal house.

[Misato]
"Thanks."

The door was open slightly.
He saw Misato, kneeling on the floor.

[Tomoki]
"..."

He seemed a bit concerned.
He poked his head in and looked around.
The room apparently had been used as a storage.
Just a dusty, empty room.
But within a few days of her staying, a pleasant
scent filled the room.
That was strange for Tomoki.
From long ago, Tomoki looked at his sister as a
woman.
The impulse to leave the path... It was always
accompanied by fear. Something that both brothers
and sisters felt.
But, even for that Tomoki who already had a
girlfriend, those impulses never diluted.

[Misato]
"...What's wrong?"

Misato noticed him.
Tomoki saw what his sister was looking at.

[Tomoki]
"That radio, is that...?"

[Misato]
"Oh, this?"

She lifted it up.

[Misato]
"Yes, from...back then..."

She smiled bitterly.

[Tomoki]
"..."

They had a common friend before.
In a school full of strange people like Gunjo,
that friend was perhaps the strangest.
The most serious one in Gunjo.
Always manic, always crazy, always causing unreal
mischief.
And Misato knew all about it.
She thought about surprising him once, but she saw
an unbelievably emotionless face... And that was the
kind of boy he was.
When the boy noticed Misato, the focus of his eyes
would vaguely return, and he would slowly produce a
smile.
Yes, produce.
He had to consciously construct a smile.
At his core, he didn't understand what a human was.
She found out that he only knew how to imitate a
human, long after she met him.
Youko Hasekura once had warned them both about him.
It's fine to be friends with him, but just stay
aware...
Was he that fearful of a guy?
He did have something in his face that looked
dangerous.
Misato still worried over it.
Then, the radio suddenly called out.

[Tomoki]
"...Did it just?"

[Misato]
"Shhh!"

They listened carefully.
Both stopped in expectation.
Both filled with anxiousness.
Then, a small sound emerged from the radio.

[Taichi]
"This broadcast...can...anyone...hear it?"

Taichi's voice.

[Tomoki]
"W...what?"

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

She turned the tuner and the static softened.
She held her breath and listened.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjo Gakuin Broadcasting Club."
"I'm broadcasting again this week."
"How many times have I done this? Who cares, I
guess."
"Maybe number five or six."

It was such a blank voice it was surprising.

[Taichi]
"Are you living as usual? Are you okay?"
"I'm doing fine too."
"I'm doing well, no conflicts."

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I'm...desperately living."

The boy sniffed loudly.
I guess I really learned a lot lately.
Seems like I understand now the things I wanted to
know long ago.
I was at the point of tears.
c
One thing that I thought about...
If I could love people without any conditions.
I knew it was important. But I couldn't feel like it
was important.
I knew the logic, but never understood the feeling.
I've looked down on all the people around me as if
they were all worthless.
I put distance, never conversed, just stayed being
alone.
As if they weren't interesting enough.
...But, to be honest, that's not quite it.
I just never knew how to love people...but I wanted to.
And there were people who taught me how.
For your own good, love someone.
That alone would work.
And things beyond that, you shouldn't think about.
Because if you do, then the only reason you love
your partner would be because...
...You see them as family, or as sibling, or
something alike.
Misato thought...
To be able to love people...
...Taichi went through so much hardship.
Tomoki thought...
Did Taichi considered him as a friend?
When I understood that, everyone was already gone.
That's why I'm saying this now.
No one needs to answer. It's more than enough if you
could listen to it.
That's why...I'm here.
And you listening, no matter who...
...I am definitely here.
...See you next week.
The voice broke off suddenly.
There were no more words from the radio.
The siblings looked at each other.

[Misato]
"That's him..."

Tomoki nodded.

[Tomoki]
"...Taichi."

Both of them paused in the shadows.
Nothing to discuss.
Only silence.
She held the radio.
The cold plastic held no more trace of Taichi.
But she remembered.
The sensation of touch, the smell of hair, breath on
her ears.
She understood a thing after their bodies became one.
That Taichi's crazy and maniacal attitude was
because he desperately wanted to come in contact
with people.
Touko was sitting at her desk in a spacious room.
She had been down since she returned to her daily
routine.
Alone again.
No different than before she became close to Taichi.
She always had a tendency to isolate herself.
On the other hand, when she was kind, she depended
on others deeply.
To get close to others, she had to throw away her
own pride bit by bit.
And she was so brittle.
It was relevant as she went to an all-girls school.
But, years before, she had a fight with her
classmates in search of friends.
Gender didn't matter on when it came to dependence.
What Touko really desired was someone dependent
on her alone.
Because she had hurt others, Touko took that
notorious national exam.
Then...she was sent to Gunjo.
All of her friends suddenly were gone.
No one contacted her. That drove Touko to be
more and more perverse.
Even the love of her parents, that had moved her to
this mansion couldn't heal her.
Someone else was necessary.
Of course, her parents had loved her.
But Touko needed someone else to be loved.
Someone else, she needed someone else to see the
value in her.
And the interaction and attitude that went with it.
She craved it more than death. Seeking the ecstasy
of that satisfaction.
Enough to throw away one's own self-respect.
...Not knowing whether if it was the most important
thing or not.
Someone knocked on the door and called out.
The housemaid brought Touko her dinner.

[Touko]
"...Oh, just put it there."

The housekeeper asked why Touko didn't go out, or
when she would stop being so down...

[Touko]
"I just don't feel like doing anything."

The housekeeper didn't leave.
She continued to express her concern.

[Touko]
"...I know already."

She chased the housemaid away and went back to her
desk.
Her stomach growled.

[Touko]
"..."

Her body always betrayed her.
She opened the door and brought the food tray in.
She was eating her food in a mixture of despair and
hunger when the radio began to speak.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating well? This is Gunjo Broadcasting
Club."

She accidentally spat out the food she was eating.
She coughed on the rest.

[Touko]
"?!"

She turned up the radio volume.

[Taichi]
"I'm doing well. I guess people were made to live on
their own."

[Touko]
"...Taichi?!"

[Taichi]
"Are you alive?"

He said it suddenly.
Lately, I've been thinking about the minds and hearts
of people.
His ability to live by his heart.
If you don't stand on your own, your heart will never
spread to others.
That's why a person needs to live on their own.
That's why people are born at a distance from 
each other.
It's fine using others.
In order to live fully, you can connect with others.
But...you can never be one with others.
Just like you, who is listening to this radio, and I...
...We will never come in contact with each other.
But the weak heart doesn't want to believe that.
It tries to cover over others...
...Depend on others, subordinate.
In many ways, it seeks to bypass that distance
between us.
But that's impossible.
You're born alone, and you're alone until you die.
The distance may seem like a desperate one.
Maybe you don't like to think of it.
But still, I am here.
I guess I'll transmit again like this next week.
And the next week, and the next...
...Until I die.
And if you're living there, just like how I am
living here...
...That alone makes me happy.
It makes me want to keep living.
See you next week.
The transmission ended.
Touko squeezed the radio so strongly she almost
broke it.
Her head hung over the radio.

[Touko]
"Living...what...living?"
"Am I going to live...alone?"

Alone, without being recognized by Taichi.
Never be able to share these emotions to him.
But he said to be satisfied for just being there.
There's no way she could.
She knew the weakness of her own heart.
What to do then?
Could she ever love another?
Would Taichi wish for that?
Touko's heart seemed scrambled in a thousand
directions.

[Touko]
"Like I can find anyone else...stupid!"
"No one will ever like a weird girl like me..."

Nobody would ever call out to her.
Only Taichi would ever do that.

[Touko]
"I want to see you again, Taichi..."

Tears fell.
She fell to her knees as she crumpled up, and her
head fell to the floor.
She fell into a fetal position, as her body shook
slightly.
She wanted to be cuddled.
Because she was weak.
She wanted to be touched.
Because she was still immature.
She would stand on her own.
But how long would it take until she could really do
that?
Touko couldn't even imagine it.
The scent of freshly cut flowers had drifted to an
old store.
A pair of girls.
Kiri and Miki.
They were eating together.

[Miki]
"So, this is the last time I'll eat with you, Kiri!"

Sarcasm.
Kiri had to respond with a smirk.

[Kiri]
"I'll drop by more. Then we'll do it again, okay?"

The heat still lingered.
The vanilla popsicle they were both eating was
melting quickly.

[Miki]
"...To go to a normal school... Sounds nice."

She repeatedly told Kiri.
Kiri just had to laugh.
Honestly, Kiri felt down about everything.
Kiri Sakura had recovered from her state and was
ready to leave Gunjo Gakuin.
They acknowledged that she was now able to adapt 
to society.
Of course, there will be discrimination.
Because she had been branded once already.
But Kiri had decided to leave.
She hadn't decided to let go of her feelings.
She hadn't even affirmed herself.
Still, she decided to go.
And Miki didn't understand why.
They had fought over it.
It was their first fight.
But Kiri would go.
The Flowers were in danger of breaking up.
Miki had black thoughts about it.
And this troubled Kiri.
And, their final day commuting to school together
came.

[Kiri]
"You'll be able to go somewhere too if you work
harder, Miki!"

[Miki]
"Hmm, it's not that my heart is broken, it's
something that I was born with..."
"I just have to keep dealing with it..."

She bit the popsicle. Aggressively.
Miki was a scaring her.
Kiri felt uneasy...even though this was their last
day together.
Miki didn't want to leave Gunjo, after all.
It's just that she hated that Kiri would be leaving.
Kiri tried to calm her about it.
Miki spoke her mind.
It was just something they couldn't come to terms
with.

[Kiri]
"Miki..."

They were both flustered about it.
She thought of many excuses.
Kiri had said that her journey was important, but
tried to explain that it wasn't more important than
her relationship with Miki...
...Kiri wanted to stay as a duo forever and distance
wasn't an issue, but Kiri needed to move on...
...And though she had thought it over, she had tried
to express that progress was better than remaining
here but simply couldn't explain her feelings.
...And in a cold sweat, she dropped the last bits of
her popsicle on the ground like a melting candle.
She was actually about to cry.
She looked at her partner, and Miki smiled back.

[Miki]
"Well, Kiri, I'm glad you get to venture to a
different school."

[Kiri]
"!!"

Kiri was surprised by Miki's sudden understanding.
Kiri wanted to say something positive.
However, her mind went blank.
She couldn't do the way they do on dramas.
She finally forced the words out.

[Kiri]
"We'll always be a...duo...okay?"

She worked so hard to say them.

[Kiri]
"Even if we're apart."

[Miki]
"Yeah, I know."

She nodded and pointed to Kiri's popsicle.
The final bit of Kiri's popsicle dropped and landed
with a splat on the ground.

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

The air around them seemed to stand still.
Then...

[Taichi]
"...Gunjo...Broadcasting..."

The radio was in Miki's chest pocket.
Miki grabbed at it and took it out.
The rumored broadcast had come.
She stuck her earbud in and shared the other with
Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Is this...?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, it's Taichi."

The mysterious radio broadcast.
News about it had spread over the Internet, and it
had become an urban legend throughout Japan.

[Taichi]
"Today, I'd like to tell an old tale."

Taichi Kurosu.

[Taichi]
"I may have told this before, but since I can't
remember..."

There was no doubt about it.
He disappeared, leaving only a strange memory to the
club members.

[Taichi]
"But I know I talked about it before."

It hadn't been abandoned or disappeared.

[Taichi]
"I have a sin from the past which I have to confess
about."

Alone, not knowing if others knew the truth.
A phantomlike young boy.

[Kiri]
"Is he alive...or...is he around here? But why?"

[Miki]
"He's broadcasting..."

A phantom broadcast.
It was the first time the two had heard it.

[Taichi]
"I've...let a friend die."

He continued telling the story.
The story of a friend.
The story of Taichi leading a friend to his death.
That story.

[Kiri]
"..."

[Miki]
"..."

They stood still until the last word was said.
Then the static arose and erased the youth's voice.
They sighed, as if they were freed from a spell.

[Kiri]
"...Is it what I think it is?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, no doubt. It's the...club activity."

[Kiri]
"In the town...with no one in it?"

[Miki]
"Maybe..."

[Kiri]
"Alone?"

[Miki]
"Yeah...maybe."

[Kiri]
"Isn't that...cruel?"

[Miki]
"I think Taichi desired to be alone."

[Kiri]
"But still...!"

[Miki]
"Just sending his voice...that's just like him, right?"

The other world, and their world.
How was Taichi able to return the two...
And he remained, to broadcast alone.

[Kiri]
"...Yeah."

[Miki]
"This is so lonely."

[Kiri]
"Yeah, and I feel really sad."

[Miki]
"I want to see him again."

[Kiri]
"Me too."

On the day these two close friends would part.
They had to confront past farewells too.

[Taichi]
"Well, then...see you next week!"

And with those words, the broadcast was over.

[Sakuraba]
"Heh..."

A path among the mountains.
Sakuraba stopped his bike to rest and laughed a bit.

[Sakuraba]
"It's been a while, my friend."

There was no way his words would reach him.
Even so, Sakuraba said it.
He would do what he wanted as long as he bothered no
one else. He would hang out with whoever he liked.
He thought that Taichi was gone.
But today, he had heard his voice.
Sakuraba thought that he was alive somewhere.
Just with that thought, his heart was filled with
happiness.

[Taichi]
*zzz*
*snort*
"Hmmmmnn..." *zzz*

[Misato]
(Pekke is asleep.)

[Sakuraba]
(He's snoring.)

[Miki]
(He's so cute when he sleeps.)

[Kiri]
(When he's sleeping, that is.)

[Touko]
(Should we wake him...in revenge?)

[Tomoki]
(I think we could...thinking about all the things he
did to us.)

[Touko]
(He really surprised me...geez...)

[Miki]
(Covered...with...blood.)

[Kiri]
(Splatter.)

[Sakuraba]
(Covered with blood splatter.)

[Tomoki]
(...You're saying the same thing.)

[Touko]
(I want to bring Taichi to where we are.)

[Misato]
(But that would mean killing him, right?)

[Youko]
(...Stop.)

[Touko]
(Hasekura's starting to be overprotective!)

[Youko]
(I just told you to stop.)

[Touko]
(Grr...)

[Youko]
(Grr...)

[Miki]
(Battle begins.)

[Misato]
(Both of you calm down, please.)

[Youko]
(Please, be quiet. He'll wake up.)

[Kiri]
(That's such patronage...)

[Miki]
(I'll do it for you Kiri!)

[Touko]
(Get a room you two.)

[Miki]
(Gyaa!)

[Tomoki]
(You guys are making too much noise!)

[Sakuraba]
(He seems fine with it.)

[Misato]
(Pekke's really sleeping well.)

[Kiri]
(I wonder if he's dreaming?)

[Miki]
(He's laughing.)

[Touko]
(Yeah, he looks like he's having fun... Good for
you, Hasekura.)

[Youko]
(Yeah...)

[Misato]
(I wanted to say good bye, but there is no way for
us to get in contact with him...)

[Sakuraba]
(It's goodbye.)

[Tomoki]
(Bye Bye.)

[Touko]
(What's with the rush guys! Goodbye, Taichi!)

[Misato]
(Stay safe.)

[Miki]
(Goodbye.)

[Kiri]
(Stay healthy.)

[Youko]
(...sniff.)

[Misato]
(Don't cry, okay?)

[Sakuraba]
(See you later.)

[Touko]
(What do you mean, see you later?)

[Miki]
(We'll meet again I hope.)

[Kiri]
(...Pushy.)

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

I stood up.
I felt a strange sensation.

[Taichi]
"I heard...everyone's...voices."

But none of them were here on the roof.
It was all silent.
Maybe the whisper of fairies?
It was more like I felt them, not hear them.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm?"

Maybe I'm just half awake.

[Taichi]
"Whatever..."

I went back to sleep.
Maybe I'll see a dream.
A dream is just like the real world, a patched up
place where it is unstable.
But for a person like me who stopped talking to my
conception, it's the only world that...

[Taichi]
*sniff*
"..."
"..."
"..."
"...Haha."
"Geez...everyone..."
"I'm...sleepy."
"See you...later guys..."
"Later..."
"..."
"..."
