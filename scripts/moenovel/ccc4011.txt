I returned home several hours later.
Tomoki had left a letter in front of my house.

[Taichi]
"..."

Youko was cremated.
It was the only way to keep her from decaying.
Then she was buried.
No grave was prepared.
Her death meant nothing.
I wondered what she would have done in my shoes.
If somebody had killed me.

[Taichi]
"..."

She would have tracked them down and killed them.
It might have been a massacre.
But...I couldn't do the same for her.
Revenge wasn't my end game.
My heart was still a flutter.
Right. I'll write a journal entry.
This had to be documented.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

There was a sound outside.
I put out the candle.
And I went to the window.
I looked outside.
Someone was walking past the front of the house.
Kiri...
She was holding something.
Well, it was none of my concern.
I returned to my desk.
And took up my pen.
