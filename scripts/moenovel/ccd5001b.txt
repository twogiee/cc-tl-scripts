And then it was night.
Not a chance to escape.
Guess that was only natural when you're chained up.
Chewing was all I could do.
But no teeth were strong enough to chew through
chains.
Time passed by idly.
The weekend was coming fast.

[Taichi]
"Phew."

My body felt hot.
I was slowly losing my mind.
It was getting harder and harder to think.
This was bad.
The scenery of the room hardly changing made it worst.
All I could do was think, but the heat wouldn't let me.
My imprisonment was agonizing.
Humans never could get used to boredom.
Not being able to move much was another factor.
My heart was tense, and I was irritated to the point
of madness.
This continued to burn my body.
I'd be smoked salmon before long if this kept up.

[Taichi]
"...Damn it all."

This was rough.
Just rough.
There was no need for torture.
All you have to do is hang them in a room of nothing.
The nothingness would slowly continue to inflict
pain to them.
The door opened.
My eyes unconsciously turned to the door.

[Taichi]
"Oh..."

It was Youko.
She was all who was left in this world.
She brought dinner.
Hunger...oh yeah, I guess I feel hungry too.

[Taichi]
"I'm so...hungry."

My voice sounded so frail, I sounded like someone
else.
She let me eat.
It was curry today.
Its mild, sweet taste coated my stomach.
And then water.

[Taichi]
"Seconds please..."

Youko brought it without saying a word.

[Taichi]
"It's delicious."

She gently caressed my face.
What if...
I contemplated.
Without thought, just yield to her.
Forget about next week.
Who I am right now was going to be someone else
anyway...
No.
The need to resist welled up inside of me.
I couldn't abandon who I was now.
I kept my will strong.
I was the one who sent everyone back.
I've kept a lot of memories to myself. I was like a
ticking time bomb.
I took care of myself.
I forced myself to endure.
Until the day the sky rotted away.
I'd survive.
And in order to do that...

[Taichi]
"Thanks. You can go."

I said it coldly.

[Youko]
"..."
"Heheheh."
"I love you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Cool."

[Youko]
"Meanie."

[Taichi]
"Shut up, moron."

[Youko]
"You called me a moron."

[Taichi]
"And I meant it, too."
"If you want to make this a phenomenon, you should
kill the me now, right this second."

[Youko]
"Killing you is not an option, Taichi."

She licked my cheek.

[Taichi]
"Knock, it, off!"

Her nose caressed my neck.

[Youko]
"Your scent..."

[Taichi]
"Ugh. Get out of my space!"

[Youko]
"Sniff, sniff"

[Taichi]
"Don't smell someone without their permission!"

[Youko]
"I like you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Listen to me!"

She toyed with me more.
...

[Youko]
"Thank you for the meal."

She left.
The door closed.
Isolation reared its ugly head again.

[Taichi]
"Damn it all...!"

I yelled.
Next thing I knew, it was night.
I guess my mind was in the void.

[Taichi]
"..."

I guess she fed me, cleaned me...at least I think
she did...
I couldn't figure out if that was today or yesterday.
The room was barren.
My freedom stolen.
My consciousness faded as if shrouded in mist.
My thought process was paralyzed.
What day was it today?
I think it was...Thursday?
What happened yesterday?
Zero change made it impossible to judge the passing
of time.
I couldn't take this anymore.
My stomach growled.
I guess I was hungry.
The door opened.
It was her.
She had a bucket full of hot water.
Ah, bath time.

[Youko]
"Okay. I'm gonna wipe you clean."

[Taichi]
"Go right ahead..."

The way I said it was cruel, but my body couldn't
resist her.
I got goosebumps all over my body the second I saw
her.
I was excited.
I couldn't wait for the sweet sensation she would
give me.
She squatted down near me.
The teasing started.

[Youko]
"Sweet dreams, Taichi."

My conciousness was drifting, making it hard to know
if I was awake or not.
She was right in front of me.
The Isolated Princess.
The girl who always kept her ego, was now really tense.

[Taichi]
"This is...not good..."

I was...nervous.
Because I could feel her scent as she approached.

[Taichi]
"Why are you doing this?"

She spoke with an alluring smile.

[Youko]
"This is a contract... It will be carved onto us, so
that we die on the same day."

[Taichi]
"Carved?"

[Youko]
"We'll be soulmates."

And then two little shadows overlapped.
...
A dream...
An old dream.
So this memory also remained.
Yeah, that was my first time with her...
My mind suddenly became clear.

[Taichi]
"Ah, I see... I'm..."

Imprisoned.
I could see the night sky through the window.
Today was Thursday, right?

[Taichi]
"Escape... I've gotta escape..."

Then, like always....I dozed off...

[Taichi]
"..."

Oh, it was morning already.
...Or was it noon?
My time awareness was nonexistent.
Meal times kept changing, so not even my stomach
was a good indicator.
Hours and minutes were both equally hellish.
Next thing I knew I was looking at the doorknob.
I expected a visitor.
And then it dawned on me.
I was feeling lonely, more than I thought.
Only in a matter of few days?
Just being trapped in a room?
I was always overly optimistic and childish.
I can live on my own.
I can do everything myself.
Why did I think that?
My body was hot.
The doorknob turned.

[Taichi]
"...!"

It made me look.
I had to see it.
Change. Hunger. Various feelings.
I was feverish with numerous desires.

[Taichi]
"Youko..."

My body felt like it was about to burst.
She gave me water first.
She dealt with other things.
She wiped my body with a steaming hot towel.
And...

[Youko]
"You're cute, Taichi. I really like you."

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

She left.
A toy.
I'm a toy.
No... A tool.

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

I was her puppet.
And then as usual.
Morning came again.
No birds or cicadas song to be heard.
The morning felt like nothing.
The border between fiction and reality.
I could no longer tell if this was a dream or not.
I always thought dreams had an end...
Night.
It was dark, so it must be night.
But it was also dark when my eyes were closed.
It might not be night.
If I open my eyes it would be daytime.
The world was created and destroyed with every
blink of an eye.
I sighed.
This was the result of accumulated stress.

[Youko]
"..."

Youko was suddenly there.
Was it an illusion?
It...smelled...like a girl.
I guess it's real.

[Youko]
"How do you feel?"

Feel?
I didn't know.
I couldn't think.
I had no feelings.
All I wanted was to disappear.
I couldn't stop thinking.
In the darkness, I was wrapped in something warm.
...
...
...
Yes... Today was Sunday.
My head felt refreshed.
Oh yeah. Yesterday...
If my desires were fulfilled, my sanity would return.
You could say it was an oversight on Youko's part.

[Taichi]
"Can I break it...?"

The weakest part of the chains was the grounding
portion.
I continuously applied pressure to it but couldn't
get it to break.
I guess...I had to play my trump card.
I sunk into depression.
For a certain time, she was my other half.
I wondered if this was betrayal.
But...I didn't want to disappear...
Losing to myself and starting from square one would
be horrible.
One must overcome themselves, and I knew that was a
difficult thing to do.
I truly hated myself.
And I didn't want to lose to someone I hate.
But I didn't hate Youko.
But I had to hurt her.
She had her own weaknesses.
A simple prick could become the fatal wound
that brought her to her knees.
I closed my eyes. Contemplated.
I thought about everything from the first time we
met, up until now.
I opened my eyes. I knew what had to be done.
Sorry, Youko.
I was going to resort to something cowardly.
...
And...

[Youko]
"Morning."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"I'm going to wipe you down..."
"You at least want to be clean on the last day,
right?"

[Taichi]
"..."

When she was done, she spoke.

[Youko]
"This is farewell."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"There is no need for us to be sentimental, but..."
"Taichi. I'm so sorry..."
"There's no way to keep you the way you are now."
"So...one last thing..."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Come with me."

She pleaded for me to follow.
I was kind of surprised to see her like that.

[Youko]
"Before the reset...we can spend the same time
together..."
"Unfortunately, it's not forever."
"But I think it'll be good for us."
"Taichi...?"

I appreciated the offer, but...
I...

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"I see..."

She took the silence as refusal and sighed a little.

[Youko]
"Okay, Taichi. See you next week."
"Though, you won't remember anything."

She started to leave.
I opened my mouth.

[Taichi]
"Coward..."

She stopped in her tracks.

[Youko]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"I called you a coward."
"And you're a traitor."

The look on the face when she turned around had 
no emotion.

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

I smiled.
To show some malice.

[Taichi]
"You really thought I'd forget?"
"That the shock would blow it all away?"
"I remember. I remember everything..."
"Or did you think I wouldn't talk about it?"
"Did you really think I wouldn't?"

I said it all with a cold intimacy.

[Taichi]
"I liked you... I really liked you."

My memories, went back to childhood.

[Taichi]
"The you in the library, who I never spoke to."
"The you who sat up straight, never had any
connections with others, and only focused on
yourself..."
"That's the you I liked."
"I had no intentions in becoming friends with you."
"There was no need to make any connections."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"But you were driven into a corner and almost
destroyed."
"Of course I felt a little sympathy for you. I knew
what you went through and back then I was able to
think more normal."
"That's why I broke our unspoken agreement."

[Youko]
"Stop it..."

Her voice was frail and quivering.

[Taichi]
"I called out to you."

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"At that mansion, I was the only one on your side,
right?"
"That's why I became more aware of you."

[Youko]
"How it happened doesn't matter..."
"I just simply chose you, Taichi."

As frightened as she was, she still kept her
composure and kept speaking.
Surprisingly, she spoke with her usual tone.

[Youko]
"There is no need to explain in detail what and how
my feeling changed."
"I like you. I love you."
"We're soulmates. We're inseparable."
"That's enough."

[Taichi]
"I don't feel that way."
"For you...anyone will do."
"As long as they fit the part."
"You chose me? No. It was automatic. I was the only
one available."
"And how did that work out for us?"
"You no longer became independent, and I was made
into a monster."
"And then..."

[Youko]
"Stop it...!"

That was a first...
She showed intense emotion.
You're bordering on sheer terror, Youko...

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."
"I never forgot about it. Since, that was what made
me who I am now."
"Soulmates. Sure, that was the promise."
"But that requires us both to have the same feeling
towards what we do."

Youko backed off.

[Taichi]
"That day."
"The day we held hands."
"The day we carefully planned and prepared to kill
all of Shinkawa."
"The day of our revenge!"
"You said it yourself, didn't you?"
"Isn't that what you wanted to do?"
"The old Youko could have pulled it off on her own!"
"But you relied on me instead!"
"And not only that..."

[Youko]
"Stop! Stop! Stop...!"
"It wasn't like that..."

[Taichi]
"It was."

I chose my words to have impact.
The fatal bullet to bring down the beast.
It was all for me. Me, myself, and I. For tomorrow.
For the next week.
So that on Monday I could only regret what I'd done.
And on Saturday I could feel nostalgic over
memories.
And so that what I liked would continue to be what
I liked.
This would be the final crossing of our paths...
I pulled the trigger...

[Taichi]
"Remember that you didn't kill a single person that
day?"

My words...broke Youko Hasekura into pieces.

[Taichi]
"I killed them all..."
"With traps, with fire, with blades..."
"I did it alone! I killed them all!"
"You didn't do a damn thing!"

[Youko]
"No...!"

She screamed.
She was still able to scream.
I was the only one who killed back then...
I did it entirely for her.

[Taichi]
"You just cowered in fear..."
"It'd be fine if that was all."
"I would have been satisfied if you were freed and
went back to what you used to be.
"When it was all over...the way you looked at me..."
"You were completely frightened of me."

It felt awful.
My formative experience as a child.
It was traumatic.

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Soulmates?"
"Me being your everything?"
"You're a traitor. Mimi's betrayal was nothing."
"After I killed dozens, after I reached the point of
no return, after I was broken... My only ally... My
other half rejected me!"

[Youko]
"No...I..."

[Taichi]
"That's the moment I lost my sense of value."
"I couldn't understand anything anymore."
"My heart was far from human."
"After that... I do appreciate you for taking care
of me..."
"Thanks to that, I was able to act like a human."
"Feelings of love and all that. Maybe it was real..."
"But why did you even bother taking care of me?"
"That's the real question."

Her eyes welled up with doubt.

[Taichi]
"I had served my purpose, hadn't I?"

[Youko]
"It was...because...I liked you..."

[Taichi]
"I don't need the degenerated love from a perfect
human being like you"

[Youko]
"...?!"

[Taichi]
"If you didn't take care of me, you would have had a
brighter future. What a waste."
"Instead, you dedicated so much time...on what?
Trying to preserve me?"
"What did you want me to be?"
"We're not the soulmates you say we are."
"I have absolutely no need for you. And you-"

[Youko]
"Stop...!"

[Taichi]
"I'm pretty sure you don't need me either."
"The only thing keeping us together is that
incident."
"You know that, and yet you pretend not to."
"Are you okay with that? Are you really okay with
that?"
"Is Youko Hasekura willing to accept that?"
"I'd say the place you're at right now is pretty low
for someone of your caliber."
"The Youko I knew would never accept that..."

[Youko]
"Stop, Taichi... I'm begging you..."

[Taichi]
"You tried to use me but you failed."
"The me you wanted was someone who would be your
ally till your heart healed."
"The me who was a pawn moving precisely."
"And my eyes..."
"In that environment you only had one choice."
"Adults were no good. Too easy to trace."
"But if it was a child..."
"Nobody would ever think a child would be able to
kill dozens of people..."
"Choosing me. This was the only choice, right?"
"Soulmates. The contract between us."
"Almost like hypnosis."
"Obsession and pleasure."
"But you out of all people..."
"You of all people... As soon as you saw me covered
in brain, blood and entrails..."
"You couldn't make a single move."
"And once you stopped, you stayed that way."

[Youko]
"Stop...it..."

[Taichi]
"I kept going on. Unlike you."
"Because I adored you..."
"I tried. Even though it made me nuts."
"I also came to another conclusion."
"You don't actually like me."
"You're terrified of me."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And if you're terrified, that leaves you only two
options."
"To disappear or adapt."
"That's how the mind works."
"This is different from how you feel, it's a system
to conserve who you are."
"You corrupted who you were, damaged me and hoped
to be one with me."
"Why don't you...just go home?"

I said it gently.

[Youko]
"No... No..."
"I don't want to go. I want to be with you."

[Taichi]
"See, your superior mental state makes it difficult
for you to change the goal you have set."
"You're just going on autopilot."
"What's the point if you get crushed by your own
burden?"
"That's like a beast which has been scientifically
analyzed."
"Undo the chains."

Youko didn't move.

[Taichi]
"Did you hear what I said?"

Her shoulders shuddered.
She left the room and returned with the key.
Her shaking hands unlocked the chains.
She released me.

[Taichi]
"I will live. Just as I am now."
"Are you going to try to stop me? You probably won't
be able to."

[Youko]
"I don't want...to resist you."

[Taichi]
"So do you want to be forced out of here? Or do you
want to end it yourself?"

[Youko]
"But...even if I return to a world without you..."

[Taichi]
"Choose the former, and I will force you out."
"Then, by heart, we will have no longer have a
bond."

[Youko]
"No..."

[Taichi]
"Choose the latter, and that won't happen."

[Youko]
"I...don't want...either..."
"Even still Taichi, I..."

[Taichi]
"Stop using me as an excuse!"

My shout surprised her.
I placed my hand on her shoulder.

[Taichi]
"Till you die, you're alone."

I said it gently.

[Taichi]
"Every last one of us."

[Youko]
"..."

She fell to the floor.
She covered her face and took a deep breath.
She didn't make a peep. It was totally quiet.
Her fingers covered her eyes.
I couldn't tell if she was crying or not.
Youko Hasekura stayed perfectly still, with her face
covered.
That was how she screamed.
And then...
As if she had lost her soul, she followed me to
the shrine.

[Taichi]
"I'll leave you with this."
"I really liked you."

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"That's why I've watched you for so long."

[Youko]
"Can I say something?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Youko]
"Everyone, to some degree, automatically likes
somebody..."
"So what's the right way to love someone?"

[Taichi]
"Don't ask anything in return. That's it."

[Youko]
"...!"

[Taichi]
"The second you ask for something in return,
it becomes a deal."
"An exchange, a trade..."
"They become something that provides you goods."
"In other words, it's an external trade that only
satisfies yourself."
"Oh, I'm not denying it, by the way."
"But, to become a couple like that...I wouldn't be
able to handle it."

I smiled bitterly.

[Taichi]
"Not asking for anything in return...this isn't
limited to friendship."
"The answer has always been right there."

[Youko]
"Couldn't something have been done?"
"Since, I am the one who broke you..."

[Taichi]
"Even if we didn't become soulmates...I still would
have helped you."
"And it would have ended the exact same way."

[Youko]
"Oh..."

She had a smile but sounded a bit tired.

[Youko]
"So...it'd be better...if I stayed as a princess..."

[Taichi]
"That's true."
"You needed something pure, in order to get out of
the situation you were in."
"I was almost too convenient not to use."
"You should have cut me off when you had the
chance."
"Still, I would have continued to like you."

[Youko]
"But doesn't it make you feel lonely?"
"Not get anything from who you like...doesn't that
make you feel lonely?"

[Taichi]
"I like looking at beautiful things..."
"There's that. It's always been that way."
"That was the first feeling I ever felt."
"So it's okay."

[Youko]
"If... If you ever return to the other side..."
"I'll try again."

[Taichi]
"Okay."
"I hope you're the king of Japan by then, Youko."

[Youko]
"That seems...pretty unlikely."
"The system would have to be a monarchy first."

[Taichi]
"Definitely."

I laughed.
She continued to hang her head.

[Taichi]
"Farewell, Youko Hasekura."
"The Isolated Princess..."

I respectfully bowed my head.

[Youko]
"Good...bye..."

I saw her crying face.
I found it frightfully satisfying.
I closed my eyes.

[Youko]
"..."
"..."
"..."
"Ah..."
"My chest hurts... My heart...is broken..."
"I had no idea it felt like this..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I stood there for a while.
I felt accomplished.
I felt loss.
I couldn't process them together.
Before long...

[Taichi]
"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"

I shouted at the heavens.
There was no reason for it whatsoever.
I just needed to get it out of me.

[Taichi]
"It's over."

Everything.
I was the only person left in the world.
I was where I should be.
It became my sanctuary.

[Nanaca]
"You did your best..."

[Taichi]
"You..."

She hadn't appeared lately.

[Nanaca]
"Want me to hold you?"

[Taichi]
"I'd love that...but no."
"This week belongs to Youko."

[Nanaca]
"I see..."

My eyes, probably this was the last time I would 
use it.
Maybe my tapetum was starting to weaken.
The gate looked fuzzier than before.
If my eyes went back to normal, I probably wouldn't
be able to see it anymore.
Unless, I were to reset myself that is...
But I had no intention of doing that.

[Nanaca]
"It's time."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you're right."

[Nanaca]
"Congrats."

[Taichi]
"Thanks, Mom..."

[Nanaca]
"Hahahah."
"See you next week."

She disappeared, literally.
It hit me.

[Taichi]
"Did I just call her mom...?"

And then the world faded to black...
