Mmm... (In the midst)

[Taichi]
"Phew."

[Youko]
"...without any discussion."

[Taichi]
"?!"

She scared the hell out of me.

[Taichi]
"Y-Youko."

[Youko]
"Are you acting like you're in love?"

She asked without any emotion.

[Taichi]
"Could you stop sneaking behind me?"

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"What if I have a heart attack?"

[Youko]
"I don't think...it's that easy to stop YOUR heart,
Taichi."

[Taichi]
"How rude!"

[Youko]
"You didn't tell me about moving in together."

[Taichi]
"Why do I need permission from you, anyway?"

Her eyes teared up slightly.
Ever so slightly.

[Taichi]
"Even you said so. 'Acting.'"
"If that's how you see it, there should be no
problem. So, there should be no reason for you to be
mad if this is just 'acting', right?"

She hesitated a bit.

[Youko]
"Because...you did this before...and messed up."

[Taichi]
"That's because the situation was different then."
"And I have responsibility for Touko."
"Maybe things will calm down and Touko will be more
independent. Then she can start over again."

[Youko]
"There's little chance."

[Taichi]
"That's why I said maybe."

[Youko]
"..."

She may or may not have convinced.
I couldn't tell from her emotionless face.
She always had an unchanging poker face.
All the time.

[Youko]
"Okay..."

She suddenly disappeared.
She vanished out of sight, along with her unique
presence.
I felt nobody around me.
She could do things like that.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

I was tired.
