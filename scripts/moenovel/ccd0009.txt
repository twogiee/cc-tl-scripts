I stopped to take a rest.
I began eating my sandwich in the cafeteria.
And while I ate, I contemplated.
Thoughts on this week-long world:
Surprisingly, I was able to accept it.
To me, this week-long world is much easier to live
in than a world that has a future.
An endless loop of the same week.
And then something suddenly occurred to me.
A terrible thought.
For all the times this week had repeated, and would
repeat, was there no possibility for all of us to
reconcile?
The bonds between us eight broadcast club members
were frayed.
Coming to an understanding, with even just one other
member, was not a simple thing.
This was something that I noticed from reading the
journals.
If there is a way to reconcile the members...
I would really like to know.

[Youko]
"Here you are, enjoy the tea."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."
*glug glug glug*
"Aaah! It's so cool and delicious,
one more!"

I held out my empty plastic cup.
Youko Hasekura was there... She filled my cup
without a word.

[Taichi]
"Don't sneak up on me like that..."

[Youko]
"Why shouldn't I?"

[Taichi]
"It frightens people when you appear
next to them so suddenly."

[Youko]
"I wasn't sneaking. This is how I am all the time."

[Taichi]
"If you greet someone like that, their heart
would stop."

[Youko]
"You should be prepared for everything."

[Taichi]
"Nah, I prefer to be unprepared."

[Youko]
"So you're just lazy?"

[Taichi]
"I'd just rather live my life more leisurely."

[Youko]
"Sounds like a waste of time..."

[Taichi]
"It'll wear you out, being on guard at all times."

[Youko]
"You should probably make it an everyday routine."
"You're just being lazy, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"I don't need a friend like this."

[Youko]
"I'll withdraw..."

There'd be no more arguing.
There'd be no more bargaining.
There'd be no more trouble.
But only taking meant never giving.
Interpersonal relationships wouldn't be possible
this way.

[Taichi]
"It must feel like you're taking care of a part of
yourself."

[Youko]
"No..."

She was quick to understand.
However, she refused to understand me.

[Youko]
"I just love you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Well, feel free to keep doing that."

I didn't feel the need to continue the conversation.
Since she wouldn't reply even if I did say anything.
If only there was a single effective tactic that I
could use against Youko...
Well, there was one.
It was something pretty minor.
And at the same time, it was enough to destroy her.
Youko knew about it, as well.
That's why she was on her guard.
We had kept it in check as we continued our lives.

[Taichi]
"Jeez..."

I opened my mouth and took a big bite of my
sandwich.
*gulp*

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Why don't you sit down?"

[Youko]
"...Really?"

[Taichi]
"Make yourself comfy."

She sat close to me.
I handed her my second helping of sandwich.

[Youko]
"Thanks."

[Taichi]
"You made it yourself though."

[Youko]
"Still, thanks."

[Taichi]
"..."

...

[Youko]
"How does it taste?"

[Taichi]
"It's good, damn it."

[Youko]
"I see."
"Here, have some tea."

[Taichi]
"Thanks..."

[Youko]
"This is nice..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah...?"

[Youko]
"It really is."

[Taichi]
"I guess it's not too bad."

[Youko]
"Being like this... It's almost like a phenomenon."

[Taichi]
"A phenomenon?"

[Youko]
"I've thought so since long ago."
"As a human, if you aim high enough, eventually
you'll reach godhood."

[Taichi]
"?"

[Youko]
"Someday, humanity will reach the limit of the laws
of physics, and then they will try becoming a god."
"There is probably only one way to make this
happen."

[Taichi]
"Uhhh, I don't understand anything you just said."

[Youko]
"As long as the laws of physics don't change, humans
are only doing what is possible within reality.
Which means they are not creating reality."
"...They are only finding new laws of reality."
"And that is the limiting factor of humanity."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Therefore, we have no clear path for reaching
godhood."
"And to reach godhood, humanity would need to
undergo a phenomenon where they can change reality."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."
"Hmm, uhh..."

She had me completely stumped.

[Youko]
"With the two of us."

She smiled sweetly and nibbled at a piece of ham.

[Taichi]
"Mm-hm..."

[Youko]
"We need to completely understand one another to
conceive an ideal society, only then can we move on
to the next stage."
"But...all these are ineffective acts, right?"

[Taichi]
"I guess..."

[Youko]
"Even if every person on Earth was somehow
connected...god would still not be born."
"Even still, these connections may be what could
save humanity..."
"Well, as long as you are by my side, that's good
enough for me."

[Taichi]
"I'm honored..."

The conversation was pretty difficult to fully
understand...
What the hell was she really saying?
Would I really be able to communicate with her like
this?

[Taichi]
"Well, just go with the flow, I guess."
