I am Taichi, and Taichi is me.
I am Taichi, and Taichi is me.
I myself is Taichi, and Taichi himself is me.
The sole truth. No matter how much the world changed,
that one thing never will.
September 7th, Monday, early dawn.
I gave up on the idea of investigating the power
plant.
An unknown impediment blocked the investigative
process.
The further I got, the longer the process took. I
found myself eternally unable to achieve my goal.
That's how it felt.
Perhaps it was some sort of abnormality that
affected my perception and reflexes, or a spatial
rift of some kind.
My information were insufficient.
Taichi's safety was of the utmost importance...
...I should protect him.
Same day, early morning.
I obtained information at the shrine.
A truly surprising records.
These were the journals of Taichi I had never seen
before!
I knew all of the journals by heart.
But these records...it's my first time seeing them.
I investigated the contents.
I came up with a hypothesis.
I examined its likelihood.
...But the information were insufficient.
I discovered that an important part of the records
were missing.
A fatal, soul-crushing discrepancy...
...His happy ending with me was missing.
I couldn't accept this sort of pattern.

[Youko]
"I refuse to accept it..."

I needed to understand Taichi...much more.
The sun began to rise.
Monday morning had come.
There was no time to lose.
September 7th, Monday, 6:00 am.

[Youko]
"I made it..."

I secured the food I needed and preserved the rest.
And I completed the most important thing.
I think I've managed to recreate Mutsumi's cooking.
I wanted to eat this Sandwich with Taichi...
September 7th, Monday, 6:10 am.
Taichi's room.
It smelled like him.
Paradise...
September 7th, Monday, 6:20 am.
Taichi was asleep.
His sleeping face.
Adorable...
September 7th, Monday, 6:30 am.
Taichi's mouth opened slightly.
I wanted to kiss it...
He drooled a little.
I wanted to lick it...or wipe it off.
Self-restraint...
Patience...
Perseverance...
September 7th, Monday, 6:40 am.
Taichi yelled a girl's name in his sleep.

[Taichi]
"Mmm... Mimimi... They're so soft..."

It wasn't my name...

[Taichi]
"C'mon, Touko... Live a little..."

Wrong again.

[Taichi]
"Miki... Kiri... Wait your turn."

When will it be my turn?

[Taichi]
"Yusa..."

Any time now...

[Taichi]
"Mutsumi... Ms. Machiko... Miyuki..."

He still didn't say my name...

[Taichi]
"Stop it, Rubber!"
"Tomoki... You're so annoying..."

Taichi was as cruel in his sleep as he was when he's
awake.
September 7th, Monday, 6:50 am.
It was almost time to wake him.
But I let him sleep in a little longer.
I continued watching over him.
September 7th, Monday, 7:30 am.
Taichi pinched my cheek.
It was really painful...
Taichi ate his sandwich by himself.
He won't live with me.
I wish he'd be nicer to me...
September 7th, Monday, 7:35 am.
He almost lifted up my skirt.
I didn't mind if that was what he wanted.
I was ready to devote my everything to him.
He made me drink a chili juice with habanero sauce
mixed in.
Heartbreakingly hot...
Taichi was so mean to me.
September 7th, Monday, 8:00 am.
I left to reinvestigate.
If the information I've gathered at the shrine was
correct, the possibility that this world was stuck
in a one-week time loop was high.
But I wasn't one-hundred percent certain.
I had to be ready for anything.
To protect Taichi.
I reinvestigated the power plant.
And searched for an escape route out of town.
I got the things that I needed to survive.
I secured moving vehicles.
I decided priority, concocted a plan, and executed
it.
September 7th, Monday, 8:30 am.
I headed to the shrine.
The journal that indicated the possibility of a time
loop.
I prioritized that above all else.
I'll never be able to unlock this world's mysteries
without a bit of background info.
I knew what had to be done...

[Youko]
"Heheheh."

September 7th, Monday, 5:00 pm.
Gunjo Gakuin rooftop.
Taichi was staring at Misato's sleeping face.
I wish he'd stare at mine...
Miyasumi woke up.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"K-Kurosu?"

[Taichi]
"That'd be Pekke."

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

Pekke... Miyasumi's special nickname for Taichi...
Mimi... Taichi's special nickname for Miyasumi...
Special nicknames.
I...didn't have one.
Youko was fine and all, but I'd rather have one.
It's Taichi, he would have called me as...

[Taichi (Delusional)]
"Super Ninja."

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi (Delusional)]
"Super Ninja."

[Youko]
"He said it twice..."

[Taichi (Delusional)]
"Then, resourceful ninja girl."

[Youko]
"..."

Not enough love...
Ninja or little ninja girl would be fine if he said
it lovingly.
Taichi buried his face in the chest of a girl with
glasses.
Completely buried.
My chest was available too...
I hoped he'd do the same to me someday...
September 7th, Monday, 6:30 pm.
I left a note on top of the table.
"There might be supper for you."
I made food for Taichi.
He'd come, right?
This was the only way I had to get close to Taichi.
I was afraid...
I was afraid of Taichi.
I was afraid...he'd cut ties with me.
September 7th, Monday, 7:30 pm.
Candlelight flickered from Taichi's room.
He was up to no good.
September 7th, Monday, 8:00 pm.
He was about to use the notebook I gave him.
He opened the safe...without writing anything.
Taichi loved his Ultimate Body Pillow
more than he loved me.
I wept...
September 7th, Monday, 8:45 pm.
Taichi put an obstacle in the safe.
He took up his pen and wrote in his journal.
September 7th, Monday, 8:50 pm.
He opened the safe again.
I wanted to be a body pillow...
September 7th, Monday, 9:32 pm.
The candle went out.
Taichi was unaware and occupied.
September 7th, Monday, 10:17 pm.
The candlelight returned.
He started writing in his journal.
September 8th, Tuesday, 12:00 am.
I checked Taichi's journal.
I compared it with what I have read from the shrine
journals.
I saw a lot of similarity.
Taichi's handwriting was a perfect match from those
of the notes.
The events of September 7th were expressed
in the same way at a very high frequency.
It was very likely that the shrine records
were written by Taichi.
Taichi's records from the same week...but with
different contents.
The intersection of nearby space...
Repetition of the same time axis...
Clever imitations... All sorts of possibilities.
In any situation. Any world. Any space. I will be
with Taichi.
That will never change.
September 8th, Tuesday, late night.
Taichi's sleeping face...
Taichi's sleeping breath...
Adorable...
I was with Taichi.
Same day, early morning.
I found Taichi's footprints.
The size and sole both matched.
The footprints headed toward the woodland shrine.
There were old prints with the new...
He had made this round-trip several times.
As far as I knew, the old Taichi never did anything
like this.

[Youko]
"It's a mystery..."

Same day, early morning.
I discovered a cleverly camouflaged camp
in the wooded area around the shrine.
It failed to escape my notice...
I remembered seeing the same tent
and camp equipment before.
Taichi used it during the broadcast club's
camping trip last week.

[Miki]
"Oh wow, you found me!"

[Youko]
"..."

[Miki]
"Hi, I'm Miki Yamanobe. I'm a member of the Gunjo
Gakuin's Broadcasting Club."

[Youko]
"I know..."

I became more vigilant.

[Youko]
"What are you doing here...?"

[Miki]
"I'll say this as bluntly as possible. I'm looking
to strike a deal with you."
"I'll give you the intel of this world! The juiciest
secrets out there!"

[Youko]
"..."

[Miki]
"I know you don't trust me, but at least hear me
out."

[Youko]
"..."

[Miki]
"In exchange for secrets, there is something I want
you to give me if you're happy with what I give
you."

[Youko]
"I've got nothing to give..."

[Miki]
"You do... My personal protection."

[Youko]
"It's not unconditional..."

[Miki]
"You want me to keep my hands off of Taichi, right?
I get it."

The information was highly accurate.
It matched what was described in the shrine journal.
Yamanobe might be for real after all.
Circumstantial evidence can be trusted
to a certain extent.
September 8th, Tuesday, 8:00 am.
I prepared Taichi's food for him.
Sandwiches and vegetable juice.
I divided them into breakfast and lunch.
Breakfast was just for Taichi.
Lunch...was for Taichi and me.
He should know just by looking at it.
"Eat it all before you leave."
A loving message...
September 8th, Tuesday, 8:30 am.
Taichi went to school again.
He continued to play his usual role.
He continued to dress normally.
September 8th, Tuesday, 8:35 am.

[Taichi]
"Will you buy my underwear?"

Taichi was trying to sell his underwear to Kirihara.
I'd buy them...
I'd buy them immediately...
I can get them from his room whenever I wanted.
But he'd hate me if I did that.
I'd buy them if he tried to sell them to me though.
September 8th, Tuesday, 8:40 am.
Taichi gave the sandwich to Kirihara.
How could he...?
It wasn't a sweet bun.
Kirihara ate all of it herself.
My efforts were all for naught.
September 8th, Tuesday, 8:50 am.
Taichi was chatting with Yamanobe and Sakura.
He said the three of them were like soul mates.
No... Taichi's only soul mate is me.
He invited Sakura to go see a movie.
Invited her out on a date...
Invited her out on a date.
I've never gone on a date with him before...
I've never even gone to see a movie...
I wish he'd invite me out to one.
September 8th, Tuesday, 9:00 am.
Taichi was on the rooftop for club.
He was taking care of an intoxicated Miyasumi.
I want to be taken care of like that...
But non-alcoholic beer didn't make me drunk.
That required a special genetic make-up.
Taichi tried to carry Miyasumi on his back.
A piggyback ride...
I'd love to be up against his back like that...
Miyasumi's bra fell off.
Taichi picked it up.
And he resumed carrying her.
A braless, big-breasted piggyback ride...
I hope he'd do the same with me someday.
September 8th, Tuesday, 9:20 am.
Taichi took the braless, big-breasted four-eyes to
the school nurse's office.
He stared at her sleeping face the whole time.
Taichi likes watching people sleep...
Same as me.
Taichi likes girls' underwear.
So I'm gonna like Taichi's underwear...
September 8th, Tuesday, 9:25 am.
Taichi kissed braless, big-breasted four-eyes on the
cheek.
A kiss on the cheek...
I've kissed him on the cheek
while he was asleep before.
Countless times...
But...he's never done it to me.
September 8th, Tuesday, 10:10 am.
Taichi set the alarm clock on the rooftop.
Club activities concluded for the day.
Same day, 10:15 am.
A scream from the rooftop.
There were still times when I couldn't understand
Taichi's behavior.
September 8th, Tuesday, 10:20 am.
He tried to wake Kirihara, asleep in the classroom.
He's never once tried to wake me up...
I added it to the list of things I wanted him to do
to me.
Taichi gave up and poured her some candy.
My homemade candy...will nourish her instead.
September 8th, Tuesday, 11:00 am.
Taichi joined Yamanobe and Sakura for lunch.
My candy and gummies used as bargaining chips...
My crystal treasures traded for store-bought
meatballs...
*sniff*
They chatted while they ate.
They're discussing my relationship with Taichi.
Taichi had said no to "lover," "cohabiting," and
"suspicious relationship."
He's right... Our connection was far deeper.
...
*sniff*
September 8th, Tuesday, mid-day.
Taichi took a package from the hallway
and muttered to himself.

[Taichi]
"Oh well. Guess I'll eat alone..."

Eat with me! Eat with me! Eat with me!
Eat with me! Eat with me! Eat with me!
Eat with me! Eat with me! Eat with me!

[Taichi]
"Y-Youko..."

He sensed me.

[Youko]
"..."

He ate the sandwiches for two on his own.
I wanted to eat with him so bad.
But he wouldn't eat with me.
Taichi was so mean to me.
September 8th, Tuesday, 6:30 pm.
Dinner with Taichi.
I couldn't be happier...
But he'd be mean to me if he saw me happy.
He might stop coming.
I devised a plan.
And with that...
"Can't say there's no supper."
September 8th, Tuesday, 7:30 pm.
Taichi was busy writing a script for the
broadcasting club.
He kept rewriting it.
Taichi was so concerned about appearances
that he neglected his true self in some ways.
I even liked that about him...
September 8th, Tuesday, 8:30 pm.
Taichi tossed the script aside.
He got to work on his journal.
September 8th, Tuesday, 9:00 pm.
He finished writing in his journal and returned to
the script.
September 9th, Wednesday, 12:00 am.
I checked Taichi's journal.
His writing style, manner of expression,
and daily activities.
Their resemblance to the shrine records was uncanny.
And there was the intel from Yamanobe.
The week-long loop.
The shrine escaped its influence.
I acted on a hypothesis I couldn't prove.
My goal was...
Same day, early morning.
I followed Taichi's footprints.
The numerous footprints lead to the path.
I walked carefully as to not lose sight of them.
I suddenly heard a faint, hurtling sound...
...The next thing I knew, I had an arrow on my
chest.

[Youko]
"Unnh...!"

The arrow came from the thicket.
A trap...?!
Unfortunately for me, the arrow hit me in my heart.
The wound...was fatal.
My vision got hazy.
The world slowly faded to black.
It got harder and harder to hear.
Inside the silence, only the sound of my heart
beating and the flow of blood reverberated through
my body.
This trap... Only I...or Taichi...could have...
Taichi betrayed me? Betrayed me like this?
No, it's not possible.
We're soul mates... I am Taichi, Taichi is me...
I was losing consciousness... Oh no... Taichi...
September 9th, Wednesday, 8:00 am.
Taichi was on the rooftop.
He led four-eyes by the hand and wrapped a towel
around her chest.
I had no idea he was into that...
A sports towel was his bra of choice.
This was important info on Taichi.
And knowledge is power.
September 9th, Wednesday, 8:20 am.
Another daily visit to the school nurse's office.
He held her in his arms this time.
Taichi rolled up Miyasumi's skirt and stared at her
butt.
He decided to stop staring...
It was a very Taichi-like decision.
September 9th, Wednesday, 10:00 am.
Taichi watched the pool from the window.
Yamanobe and Sakura were playing there.
He didn't take his eyes off them.
September 9th, Wednesday, 10:10 am.
Taichi was still watching the pool.
He was looking at swimsuits.
September 9th, Wednesday, 10:20 am.
Taichi had yet to lose interest in watching
the two girls play.
Was Taichi...a stalker?
September 9th, Wednesday, 11:00 am.

[Taichi]
"Put on some glasses and a white gown."

I responded to Taichi's request.
He took this opportunity to nurse Miyasumi back to
health.
Taichi slowly extended his hand towards Miyasumi's
chest.
Braless, big breasts tactic carried out.
Taichi, out of confusion, attacked me instead.

[Taichi]
"This texture...could it be?"

[Youko]
"Yep... No bra."

Taichi's face was a flutter.
Mission accomplished.
September 9th, Wednesday, 8:40 pm.
Taichi put a paper in front of him and hummed for
about an hour.
He didn't write a thing.
Suddenly, he stood up and changed into his casual
clothes.

[Taichi]
"For literary inspiration."

Seemed like he tried to get into the mood.
He pretended to be a literary master.
September 9th, Wednesday, 9:00 pm.
I examined Kirihara at Taichi's request.
She was malnourished and anemic.
She needed water and nutrients.
I asked Sakuraba and Shima to get sports drinks,
supplements and baby foods for her.
September 10th, Thursday, 7:50 am.
Taichi caught Miyasumi red-handed.
He put her in handcuffs.
They're playing...
Sure, Taichi's interest was extensive.
But this...
Was too cute.
Taichi possessed so much power that he would rule
me, absorb me.
He would surveil me, bound me, and never let me get
away.
The sweetest of ideals...
September 10th, Thursday, 8:30 am.
Taichi was headed for the station.
He searched the police box for the handcuff keys.
What a waste...

[Taichi]
"How long do you intend to follow me?"

He caught me.
Because I was daydreaming.

[Taichi]
"Don't you have something else to do?"

One question that he could have avoided...
I was...losing him.

[Taichi]
"You're weird."

Yeah, I was losing my mind.
September 10th, Thursday, 8:30 pm.
Miyasumi showed up at Taichi's house.

[Misato]
"Pekke..."

[Taichi]
"Mimi?"

Their special nicknames again.
An evening rendezvous...
Was his relationship with her progressing?
But there was no point in that.
Nobody understood Taichi.
Nobody but me...
September 10th, Thursday, 9:00 pm.
Miyasumi fed Taichi food from her lunch box.

[Taichi]
"Can you make miso soup only for me from now on?"

A proposal...
A miso soup proposal.
From lunch box feeding to a miso soup proposal.

[Taichi]
"A foreigner's type of greeting."

A kiss...
A foreign greeting kiss.
I wish he'd greet me like that.
If I asked him, I'm sure he'd...
Tease me and call it some mysterious country's
greeting.
September 10th, Thursday, 10:00 pm.
Taichi invited Miyasumi to the beach.
I also wanted to go to the beach...
With just the two of us.
I've never gone to the sea with him before.
Miyasumi hesitated, and Taichi asked again.

[Taichi]
"Please marry me!"

Didn't make any sense.

[Misato]
"I will never marry you."

Taichi was broken-hearted.
September 10th, Thursday, 10:10 pm.
Taichi was picking out a swimsuit for Miyasumi.
They're color-coordinating.
Taichi wouldn't pick out a swimsuit for me.
A standard string bikini.
Left little to the imagination...
A shameless ocean paradise of strings and shells.
Shameless but whatever.
An enchanting pearl white bikini.
It could be transparent...and it'd be okay.
A rope-less, one-piece swimsuit.
Not a problem as long as Taichi liked it.
A loincloth for girls.
I wouldn't mind being completely naked.
Taichi just had to ask...
September 11th, Friday, 5:00 pm.
Taichi was at the main gate looking dejected.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

He sighed.
Understandable...
He'd been struggling every day since he found the
shrine records.
A hopeless effort with no reward to be had.
I came out of hiding and stood before Taichi.

[Youko]
"Is there anything I can help you with...?"

I told Taichi the truth.
The hopeless limits to this world.
The phenomenon of intersecting worlds.
I thought he might understand me.
Like I understood him.
September 13th, Sunday.
Even on the final day, Taichi went to school.
Rooftop broadcasting.
Meaningless club activities.
There, we misunderstood each other, played together,
worked on equipment, and broadcasted signals to
nowhere.
But... Gunjo Gakuin's Broadcast
CROSSCHANNEL was Taichi's time to shine.
Taichi looked at me.
And gave me a thumbs-up.
My last reward for watching over him all the time.
Until the very last moment, I watched and listened
to Taichi's voice.
September 13th, Sunday.
The antenna was destroyed.
The shocked club members gathered and looked around
suspiciously.
Sakuraba struck Shima...and a conflict ensued.
Armed Sakura and Yamanobe intervened.
Kirihara was struck dead by an arrow from Sakura's
crossbow.
She aimed at Taichi next...
I rushed to the rescue.
Oh no... I wasn't gonna make it...
Taichi was struck.
He fell to the ground, covered in blood.
My world...was gone.
I am Taichi, and Taichi is me.
We were soul mates. One mind, one flesh.
A world without Taichi was pointless.
Everything ended.
The world ended, and so was my everything.
Taichi was gone, and so I didn't need anyone else.
Taichi was gone, and so I didn't need myself.
The rooftop was covered in blood.
Just like back then.
What I accomplished here was the massacre I couldn't
accomplish on that day, at that time.
This time, I killed them for you.
Would Taichi be scared of me now...?
At last, we became one.
I became Taichi, and Taichi became...me.
All that was left was to disappear
and end this world.
We will become a phenomena...
September 13th, Sunday.
Taichi took me to the shrine.
Me, who was weak.
Me, who was a coward.
Me, who was afraid to kill.
Me, who was afraid of Taichi.
And that was why...we cut ties.
Our contract...broken.
I failed... I failed him.
We're not soul mates.
Taichi is Taichi, and I am me.
And that's why...we should separate.
Taichi's last words for me.

[Taichi]
"I really liked you."

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"I've watched you for so long, you know."

Me too... I've been watching you, too.
And then... It was time to say farewell.

[Taichi]
"Farewell, Youko Hasekura."
"The Isolated Princess..."

[Youko]
"Good...bye..."

It was hard to talk through my tears.
I couldn't even do right in the end.
I am me.
Alone until the day I die.
Will be thinking about Taichi until that day comes.
