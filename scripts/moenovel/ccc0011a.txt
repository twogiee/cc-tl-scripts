There was no one in the clubroom.
It was a pretty cramped room when everyone was
hanging out there, so the lack of people made it
look quite dull.
There was a camouflage sheet stuck to the window
which had begun peeling off.
The sheet was a landscape print of the empty
interior of the clubroom.
If viewed from the other side of the window pane,
it would be difficult to tell it was fake.

[Taichi]
"..."

We always gathered here.
Tomoki often just sat and read comics.
Sakuraba too.
And Misato.
Here used to be Miki and Kiri's spot.
Then Miyuki...moved to Group X soon after, I think.
Her condition was getting worse.
Group X was different from the other classes.
It was Gunjo's last stop.
But it was known to be the happiest of the classes.

[Taichi]
"..."

Everything was unpredictable.
We were delivering a normal life, then all of a
sudden...
Some said that it was the boundary for humankind.
But I didn't believe that.
I thought it was a disease.
People lost connection with others and turned to
media for an escape.
It was like people who had access to healthier food,
but chose to take unbalanced meals and harmful
substances.
It crooked everything...
And this place is the result.
Gunjo Gakuin, the major nonconformist isolation
institution.
An inescapable home for happy students, guards,
therapists... A special institution introduced to
utilize the nuclear industry's massive profits.
A place surrounded by nature to heal one's heart.
Or so it read on the slogan.
But everyone knew better.
There was only one way to help those who scored
higher than the control value on their adaptation
test.
It was to make beneficial contacts.
In other words...
Making connections with people.
But how could we ever become close to such 
frightful teachers and guards?
It wasn't possible.
All we could do as wounded boys and girls
was to share our pain with each other.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi?"

Tomoki had arrived.

[Taichi]
"Hey, sis-kisser."

He seemed offended by my words.

[Tomoki]
"I'm over that now."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"

Nonconformists easily harbor hostility and
fear towards others.
To the former, they could become very dangerous. 
To the latter, quite pathetic.

[Tomoki]
"You decided to come as well, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Well, yeah. I wanted to see how it's holding up."
"How 'bout you?"

[Tomoki]
"Same as always."
"No lessons so I easily run out of things to do."

[Taichi]
"What about that new club you're in? Meal 
Provision Club, or something?"

[Tomoki]
"Life Maintenance Club."

[Taichi]
"Strange name for a club."

[Tomoki]
"The name isn't important."

It was a Sunday night, and after we had checked on
the clubroom, we ended up thinking about what to
have for dinner.
Starving, Tomoki suggested we collect some
leftovers from the city and split them.
I suggested that I'd go with him, but he rejected
it straight away.
Tomoki strictly opposed because he believed that
snitching food is a taboo.

[Tomoki]
"This isn't the sort of job you can ask to someone
who eats double or more of what a regular person
would."

[Taichi]
"But I told you I didn't ate it."

It was Yusa's mom who did it by herself...

[Tomoki]
"Out of the topic, but sitting here really makes me
calm down."

He sat up on his usual place in the clubroom and
took a look at the map.
The map showed the layout of the neighborhood.
He began marking spots with a red pen.

[Tomoki]
"This place has dried foods we can stock up on...
This place has raw food..."

He mumbled on and continued pouring over the map.
For a moment, he looked just like the old Tomoki,
going through his comics.

[Taichi]
"Haha..."

[Tomoki]
"Hm? What's so funny?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing."
"Just a memory."

[Tomoki]
"Hn?"

I grabbed some tape and reattached the camouflage
sheet to the window, just like how it used to be.
It was a pointless action.
But Tomoki didn't say anything about it.
