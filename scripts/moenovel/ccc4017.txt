It was early morning.
As usual I went up to the roof.
We were still working on getting the broadcasting
station ready.
Tomoki was there.

[Taichi]
"Morning."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"What's up?"

[Tomoki]
"We've made a lot of progress..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, Misato has done a lot of work on this."
"We worked hard to bring all the necessary
components up here too."

[Tomoki]
"When will it be ready I wonder...?"

[Taichi]
"The plan was to be ready by Sunday."
"You gonna help out?"

[Tomoki]
"Nah, I got something else to do..."

[Taichi]
"So, Sakuraba went on a trip..."

[Tomoki]
"So it seems."

[Taichi]
"He invited me."

[Tomoki]
"Same here."

[Taichi]
"Also, now I'm rich..."

[Tomoki]
"Really?"

He didn't care.
He was preoccupied.

[Taichi]
"Touko is dead."

[Tomoki]
"What are you talking about...?"

His face twitched.

[Taichi]
"Just kidding!"

[Tomoki]
"Why you!"

[Taichi]
"Bring it on?!"

[Tomoki]
"Forget it. I don't feel like it..."

Tomoki started to leave.

[Taichi]
"You're not going to help?"

[Tomoki]
"I'm fighting with Misato, you know...?"

[Taichi]
"Misato comes late, so how about just help me for
the morning?"

[Tomoki]
"Hm... Is there something you don't understand?"

[Taichi]
"I don't get the component wiring..."

[Tomoki]
"I guess I'll help then."

Tomoki helped me all morning.
