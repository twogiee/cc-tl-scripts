[Taichi]
"Hmm."

I figured I might as well keep her company.

[Taichi]
"I'm the kind type."

A man is about kindness.
Even when they lie they must be kind.

[Kiri]
"...?"

Kiri was there.

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Kiri]
"!"

Her face grew sullen.
Kiri was such a prickly virgin.
Perhaps a little too innocent.

[Taichi]
"Where are you going?"

[Kiri]
"It's none of your business."

She left in a hurry.
So I hurriedly followed her.
I was easily able to match Kiri's pace.
It took little effort to catch up to her.

[Taichi]
"Going to meet up with Miki?"

[Kiri]
"Please don't follow me."

[Taichi]
"I've got something to do this way too."

[Kiri]
"..."

She walked faster.

[Taichi]
*whistle whistle*

I matched her pace and whistled casually.

[Kiri]
"Grrr..."

She picked up her pace even more.
So I followed suit.

[Kiri]
"C'mon...!"

She broke out into a full sprint.
I acted off of reflex.
It was becoming a game of tag.
We passed through the shopping street.
There was a big hill up ahead!

[Kiri]
"Stop following me!"

[Taichi]
"I wanna know why you're running away!"

[Kiri]
"Because you're chasing me!"

[Taichi]
"Because you're running away!"

[Kiri]
"Stop coming after me!"

I was here!!

[Taichi]
"I *huf* was *huf* trained *huf* by this *huf* hill,
how *huf* about you?!"

[Kiri]
*huff huff huff*

Heh heh heh.
All outta steam already, huh?
With my stamina, my stark white hair, which turned
that way one frightful night, made me resistant to
the midday sun.
One could say it was super-advantageous.
We made it over the hill.
1...

[Kiri]
*huff huff huff*

2...

[Taichi]
*huff huff huff*

3...
Kiri steadily began to slow down.
Now was my chance!

[Taichi]
"Hey hey!"

[Kiri]
"Get away!"

Crap, she caught a second wind.
It was looking to be a drawn-out battle.

[Taichi]
"This is my home!"

[Kiri]
"Shut up!"

I bolted through.
She then turned down a side path that led back
towards school.

[Taichi]
"Graaagh!"

My chastity belt began to chafe.
It hurt like hell!
I was in no condition to sexually harass someone!
And yet I must!

[Taichi]
"So you think you're a match for me?!"

I could feel my fighting spirit welling up.

[Taichi]
*huff huff*
*huff huff*
*huff huff*

We burst into the school!

[Taichi]
*huff huff*

Without even taking our shoes off!
We made our way to the second-year classroom in this
manner.
*BAM*
I threw open the door that Kiri had shut and dove
into the room.
I just barely saw her exiting the rear door.

[Taichi]
"Grrr!"

I bolted through the room.

[Touko]
"Huh?!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, she's gone!"

I wasn't sure if she'd gone left or right!

[Taichi]
*sniff sniff*
"This way!"

I caught a floral scent from the right.
I flew down the stairs.
Down the first floor hallway.
I caught sight of Kiri's back.

[Taichi]
"Wah-hah-hah, your floral mint perfume is your
doom!"

[Kiri]
"Grrr!"

Kiri fled outside once more.
We ran for roughly an hour.
This was summer!

[Taichi]
*huff huff*

[Miki]
"Ah, Taichi..."

I completely passed Miki, like a midnight express
train passing by a station.

[Miki]
"Hiyaaah!"

I heard her voice from behind me.

[Taichi]
"!!"

I then felt some sort of impact.
*skid*
I slid forward...face first.

[Miki]
"I swept you off your feet!"
"Ahahahahah!"

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahah!"
"Mwah...!"

I stole a kiss from her, like a thief in the night.

[Miki]
"Mmm?!"

I gave her the drill technique.

[Miki]
"Hm?!"

Then the vibrator.

[Miki]
"Nnnnn?!"

Then the vacuum.

[Miki]
"!!!"

And to finish her off, the mixer (a Miki special).

[Miki]
"Mm! Mmm!!"

She lost all strength and shrunk to her knees.

[Miki]
"Phew... Hahhh, hahhh..."

[Taichi]
"I swept you off your feet."

I said to her proudly.
Now back to the chase.
But, that Miki...
To take the knees out from a runner...
The recent days have been nothing but radical
growth.

[Miki]
"Haah, haah, my first kiss..."

I heard Miki's voice behind me.
She got what she deserved.

[Taichi]
"Huh, huh."

With my new found energy, I took off full force.
Kiri had gained a lot of distance...
But here we were at the hill again.
I dashed up it!
However, with the chastity belt equipped, my gait
had adopted a certain bowlegged-ness.

[Taichi]
"Do you think it's over so soon, Kiri?!"

[Kiri]
"Uh!"

I caught her by surprise, and that made her fall
forward.

[Kiri]
*sniffle*

Tears began to streak down her face.

[Kiri]
"No, just stop..."

She was quite worn out.
Her legs were dragging as she ran.
It shouldn't take more than...10 seconds to
catch her.
What should I do then?
I hadn't thought about it yet.
I was only thinking to repair my wounded pride.
Stealing a second first kiss, and pillage my own
garden of Flowers...
Such an evil idea.
All right. I had settled on it.
The Flowers...would be mine...

[Taichi]
"Geh heh heh!"

I reached my hand out to Kiri, who was practically
walking at this point.
And all of a sudden...
From the corner of my eye, I caught a shadow.
In my moment of focus, time slowed to a crawl.
What was this?
A bike.
A...bike?

[Nanaca]
"Hiyah!"

[Taichi]
"No?!"

I got knocked to the ground, hard.
I could feel my consciousness wane.
The haze, and Kiri, receded.

[Nanaca]
"Really...? This brat...didn't even go to the shrine,
and just spent all day screwing around..."

She murmured something incoherent.
...
When I woke up, I was back in my room.

[Taichi]
"Ooh, oooh..."

[Miki]
"Good morning."

[Taichi]
"Ah, Miki."

[Miki]
"Yep, it's Miki. Sorry to bother you."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Something was missing from my nethers.
I brushed my hand over the area, and I couldn't feel
my reliably somewhat painful chastity belt.
It felt a little lonely.
We had endured hardship and pleasure, and covered
much ground together.

[Taichi]
"Miki... It might be a little sudden,
but that thing I was wearing..."

[Miki]
"It was pretty impressive."

[Taichi]
"Th-they're high-tech briefs."

I lied.

[Miki]
"Wooow..."

[Taichi]
"They're so high-tech, it has a sensor that makes
them automatically light up in dark areas."
"That's why it was glowing in my pants. Saturday
Night Fever anytime, anywhere."

I gave a wry smile at the thought of the naughtiness
such high-tech briefs could cause.
My expression was like that of a dog breeder, taking
pride in his most beloved, top-value pup.

[Taichi]
"They're popular with the missus too. She says, it's
easier to find the milkman in the sheets! (lol)"

*Lol: An American-style laugh, often given loudly
and proudly at one's own joke.

[Miki]
"Oh, so adult!"

[Taichi]
"Um, am I wearing another pair of underwear?"

I looked at Miki.
Her face turned red and she quickly averted her gaze.

[Taichi]
"Y-you... Did you...?"

[Miki]
"Y-yeah... You were passed out on the road... When I
picked you up, a piece of your chastity belt fell
out of your pants with a 'clang'..."

She knew it was a chastity belt!!
My head fell into my arms.

[Miki]
"And then I dragged you home..."

So that was where all those cuts and bruises were
from!

[Miki]
"When I removed your pants...it just sprung out."

Why did she feel the need to remove my pants?!

[Miki]
"I don't remember the 30 minutes or so after that...
But last I recall, I ended up on the rooftop of the
school..."

[Taichi]
"..."

That kind of memory loss was so ominous
that it made me want to run away.

[Miki]
"So I came back here, and I prepared myself... I
chose a good pair for you!"

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

I took a look inside my pants.
There was a pair of elephant underpants.

[Taichi]
"A good pair? These are what you call a good pair?"

There was a pouch on the front, fashioned like an
elephant's trunk.
It was more of a cover than a pair of underwear.
Miki was immediately bashful.

[Miki]
"Th-those are...something I wanted to see on a man!
I'm satisfied now!"

I had satisfied Miki without even knowing it.

[Miki]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"I'm amazed, that's all..."

Miki's expression was one that bore a question.

[Taichi]
"Nah, never mind that. Thanks for helping me. I
would have been sick if I'd stayed under the summer
sun."

[Miki]
"It's nothing, really."

[Taichi]
"I must repay you somehow."

[Miki]
"If you can continue living your carefree life,
that's good enough for me."

[Taichi]
"Miki...you're too good to me."

*squish*
I used the opportunity to grab her ass.

[Miki]
"Get your filthy hands off me, you baby elephant."

[Taichi]
"Whaaah?!"

My manhood took quite a blow.

[Taichi]
"Oh hey, I still have sandwiches. Let's eat them."

[Miki]
"You're so cool when you stay optimistic, Taichi!"

The drinks were no longer cool, but I prepared those
as well.

[Taichi]
"Just in time for lunch."

[Miki]
"Yay, let's eat!"

She attacked the sandwich.
*nom nom nom*
She ate like there was no tomorrow.

[Miki]
"Mmm, it's packed with...*nom* fresh veggies."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Miki]
"I always eat what I have so..."

[Taichi]
"You should eat more vegetables."

[Miki]
"That's true."

Speaking of which, Youko said she'd be back around
noon.
Maybe she was already back.
It was possible.
Behind me!
Nope, she wasn't there.

[Taichi]
"I wonder...what's going on with this world?"

[Miki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"People are disappearing, but no dead bodies are
turning up."
"All the animals are gone too."
"Since we are still alive, it seems like the
microbes inside our body haven't died out though...
How convenient."

[Miki]
"..."

She didn't respond.

[Taichi]
"Miki? Are you listening?"

[Miki]
"Um, yes... I lost myself in the wonderful
aftertaste of the sandwich..."

[Taichi]
"What are ya, Princess Peckish?"

[Miki]
"Hey, can I have that veggie thing?"

[Taichi]
"Sure, sure."

[Miki]
"Eating veggies keeps us from getting constipated!"

[Taichi]
"Have a little shame at least, Princess..."

It was good to know that we were in good spirits.

[Miki]
"So, what was it you were saying?"

[Taichi]
"It was good to know that we were in good spirits."

[Miki]
"It's too late for us."

[Taichi]
"I don't think that's true..."

[Miki]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"Don't you think it's possible that humans are in
the middle of being abducted?"

[Miki]
"You're so smart, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, don't praise me so!"
"You don't feel defeated with our situation, Miki?"

[Miki]
"Ahahah, I'm an optimist!"

[Taichi]
"Can I ask what your adaptation score was?"

[Miki]
"About 40."

[Taichi]
"Not too bad."

[Miki]
"It doesn't have an effect on my social life."

[Taichi]
"Have you always been around that same score?"

[Miki]
"Yep. Ever since I was a child."

[Taichi]
"I see. That's why they sent you to Gunjo."

[Miki]
"...I hurt people back then. This was during the
Lolita days."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, Lolita. Sweet, sweet Lolita. I wish I had
been around for that time."

[Miki]
"I have pictures, you know."

[Taichi]
"How much do you want?"

[Miki]
"Y-you look serious..."

[Taichi]
"I seriously do want some. How much?"

[Miki]
"L-let me think about it."

She was frightened.
Only for a second though.

[Miki]
"Oh yeah...my kiss... You stole it?"

Her voice lowered as she asked.

[Taichi]
"Uh... Ahhh, that. Well, it was such really bad
timing, when you kicked me, so I was a little
heated."

[Miki]
"That was my first kiss..."

[Taichi]
"I kinda guessed that..."
"But it was your attack that got my blood boiling in
the first place, Miki."

[Miki]
"Mmm..."

Miki hemmed and hawed like that for a moment.

[Miki]
"...I should just give up and think I was bit by a
dog..."

[Taichi]
"Y-you should..."

Her face suddenly lit up.

[Miki]
"Why don't we take a look at these photos
and forget our troubles?"

[Taichi]
"I-is that a disposable camera?!"

[Miki]
"That's what you're surprised about..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, you're right. My mistake."
"What kind of photos did you take?"

[Miki]
"Pictures of your baby elephant. All 24 shots."

[Taichi]
"Say whaaat?!"

[Miki]
"Maybe I should post them on the bulletin board.
Ooh, or maybe make copies for everyone!"

[Taichi]
"C-cut it out, you wouldn't do such a thing!"

[Miki]
"Hmmm, well you DID steal my first kiss... It'd
serve you right..."

[Taichi]
"Have mercy!"

[Miki]
"So will you listen to what I say?"

[Taichi]
"I'll listen, I'll listen!"

I begged eagerly.

[Miki]
"All right then, I'll return a photo for each
request you answer."

[Taichi]
"There's no need for such measures your highness,
this lowly servant will humbly obey."

[Miki]
"Heh heh heh."
"First off, you'll no longer torment Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Yep, yep."

[Miki]
"Not even to lovingly harass her."

[Taichi]
"Yep, yep, yep."

I lowered my head.
Our roles had reversed.
And so, we headed to school.
Miki had me carry her bags for her, like a servant.

[Taichi]
"Well, it's good that we're here, but what are-"

[Miki]
"Ah, I'm meeting up with Kiri here."

[Taichi]
"Yes, ma'am."

I handed over her bag.

[Miki]
"Oh, when you have the opportunity, get these
developed as well."

She took out her camera and gave a bold smile.

[Taichi]
"Hmm, I am your loving servant..."

[Miki]
"Okay then!"

She leisurely skipped off.
Well then...
In the end, there was nothing to do at school.
Perhaps I should just go home.
But... Was it okay to be this easygoing?
The world...had faced an end.

[Taichi]
"..."

What was I supposed to do?
What could I have done?
Unsolved mysteries were fine, but only when they had
a solution.

[Taichi]
"...Hold on."

Perhaps I did have something to do.
The shrine...
Nanaca and Youko had both mentioned it.
The shrine...huh...
Perhaps, my free time should be spent checking it out.

[Miki]
"Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, Miki?"

Kiri was with her.
I could see the hostility plainly on her face.

[Taichi]
"You look a bit tired, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"I wonder...whose fault that is..."

She seemed like she was ready to collapse.

[Miki]
"Since you two have kicked off the first day of the
semester on bad terms, I've come up with a plan!"

[Taichi]
"I don't think we did."

[Kiri]
"Nah, we did."

How honest of her.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm... If she says so, I guess it's true. What
should we do?"

[Miki]
"Let's do club."

[Taichi]
"Club? The one that Tomoki's doing?"

[Miki]
"Nope, the one Misato's doing."

[Taichi]
"Ohh, that one..."

That Sunday night.
With all traces of humanity disappeared, we had
settled on a plan.
To wait and see...
Even though we all didn't get along perfectly.
There was no other choice.
In that time, Tomoki would maintain and distribute
rations, and Mimi would send out an SOS via the
antenna.
Camping together got us into all sorts of disputes,
and it made everyone exhausted.
There was no one that would agree with what the two
had planned.
To be honest, Misato has been neurotic lately.
My asking the impossible by having us camp together
was the finishing blow.
I felt the need to apologize...
And my reluctance to speak was in the way.

[Miki]
"Enjoy doing club together. That's an order."

[Taichi]
"Roger..."

Well, whatever. I had no objections.

[Miki]
"You too, Kiri!"

Miki gave Kiri's back a firm pat.

[Kiri]
"I already told you I got it..."

Does Miki know Kiri's weakness or something?

[Miki]
"If you don't obey me...I'll put those photos up,
remember?"

[Kiri]
"Please not that..."

I knew it.

[Taichi]
"Um, maybe we should go to the rooftop and help
out?"

[Miki]
"For sure. Calmly, and collectively."

[Taichi]
"I'll do my best."

[Kiri]
"I need to go to the bathroom..."

[Miki]
"Hey, wait!"

Kiri made straight for the women's room.
Miki followed her in.
I went along as well.

[Miki]
"Don't just let yourself into the women's room!"

She shoved me out.
The boundary between the bathroom
and the hallway divided me and Miki.

[Miki]
"Bad habits are popping up."
"Whenever Kiri runs into something she doesn't like,
she confines herself."

[Taichi]
"Of course, she's in her sensitive teen years."

[Miki]
"Right, so please go ahead without us. We'll catch
up."

[Taichi]
"Got it."
"I'll leave this with you then, Miki."

I took something out of my pocket.

[Miki]
"What's this?"

[Taichi]
"It'll be handy if you ever lose your house key or
something."

It was a fountain pen, cut roughly in half to be
used as a tool.

[Miki]
"But why would you give me something like this?"

[Taichi]
"Just in case. Once you get used to it, it shouldn't
take you more than 30 seconds to use."

[Miki]
"I see...with something like this...there was no
use of hiding..."

Her voice fell to a low whisper.

[Taichi]
"Uh, what?"

[Miki]
"Nothing. I'll borrow it for now. But I doubt I'll
need it..."
"By the way, were you good at this?"

[Taichi]
"Could do it in my sleep."

[Miki]
"Unbelievable... This guy..."

[Taichi]
"All right, see you two later."

I left for the rooftop.
