I stayed inside for a short while, but my square
self soon found it pointless.
While I was within the shrine, I felt none of the
weirdness that I'd felt before.
Even so, the passage of time was a bit strange.
Or would it be more correct to say that time within
the shrine felt right, and it was time back in the
city that felt strange?
Whatever the case, I left the shrine.
I put the notebooks back where I found them.
Having that information was important.
The more information stored here, the better.
Even if everyone's memories were reset, Youko would
most likely find out about the shrine each time.
And every time I saw the notebooks, I would be able
to come to the same conclusion.

"Oh yeah, the uniform..."

Nanaca's uniform.
It was a design I'd never seen before.
It was definitely a clue.
I wouldn't necessarily meet her after every reset.
There was the option of going to seek out Nanaca.
There was no record of Nanaca's uniform
in my personal uniform encyclopedia.
Hmmm, if it wasn't in my personal records, that
meant...

[Taichi]
"Beats me."

I decided to put the thought aside.
If I happened to run into Nanaca again, I'd have to
ask her about it.
All right then.
Off to school.
In any event, the only thing to do was to continue
logging each day in my journal.
It was the only thing I could think to do.
