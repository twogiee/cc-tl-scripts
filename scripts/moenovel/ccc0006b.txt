[Taichi]
*sigh*

I started the journey to school like a robot.
I felt discomfort in my crotch.
It hurt when I walked.
I had to walk bow legged.

[Taichi]
"At least this pose suits nice fellows... I guess
I'll go with the scruffy look."

The only thing I could was to act normal.
I walked up the slope.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

It was the sound of tires screeching against the
road.
Red flag.

[Taichi]
"Too easy...!"

I was harassed from early morning.
My whole body was sensitive due to the sexual
excitement!
In other words, it meant that my ability to detect
danger had become sharper.

[Taichi]
"Haa!"

I could evade any sort of attack as long as I knew
it was coming.
*kaboom*

[Taichi]
"Whaaa?!"

If it weren't for this chastity belt getting in the
way of my walking!!

[Nanaca]
"Sorry about that!"

I was hit hard and flew into a bunch of bushes.

[Nanaca]
"Are you okay?"

[Taichi]
"...The chastity belt protected me."

[Nanaca]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Never mind. It's a personal joke."

I got out of the bushes and brushed off the dirt.
Of course, with bowed legs.

[Nanaca]
"Bowed leg."

[Taichi]
"Don't call it bowed legs."

I spoke defensively.

[Nanaca]
"You look good again this week."

[Taichi]
"I don't understand."
"Let's at least try to reason with each other
properly, Tomie!"

[Nanaca]
"It's Nanaca, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Anyway, how is it that you know my name when I have
no clue who you are?"

[Nanaca]
"Don't worry about it."

[Taichi]
"I will worry about it."

She looked quite athletic.
I was walking at a fairly slow pace, but she
followed along well without even staggering.
At first sight, she looked like a bubbly, beautiful
young girl who could be a childhood friend.
A good childhood friend who would come to wake me 
up every morning.

[Taichi]
"So, what do you want? You person without a
presence."

[Nanaca]
"No presence?"

[Taichi]
"Nope. None. Nothing."

[Nanaca]
"I don't get it... Is it some sort of sign?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. To put it bluntly, my brain's deliberation
committee is telling me that you're not a human."

[Nanaca]
"Ha... Taichi you really are sharp."

[Taichi]
"Hmph."

The unexpected effects of the morning blow-job.

[Taichi]
"With my perception capabilities and meta-reasoning,
I can pin down your true colors."

[Nanaca]
"Wow, really?"

[Taichi]
"You're a Scorpio girl... In other words, you're an
intelligent life form from planet Scorpio V861."

[Nanaca]
"That's the black hole, you know."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaca]
"You're pretty careless."

[Taichi]
"Well, that's my job."

[Nanaca]
"You're a pain every time we meet."

[Taichi]
"What do you mean every time? I don't know what
you're talking about. It's our first time meeting
right?"

[Nanaca]
"We've bumped into each other a lot you know?"

[Taichi]
"No way, not possible"

I had no memory of it.
It's not like I had amnesia.

[Nanaca]
"Anyways..."
"But it would be interesting if love blossomed at
least once."

She said something unbelievable.

[Taichi]
"Uh... Are you trying to say you're interested in
me? Me, with a hooked nose?"

[Nanaca]
"What hooked nose? It looks normal."

[Taichi]
"It's crooked here. You can tell straight away."

[Nanaca]
"Not at all."

[Taichi]
"That's odd..."

[Nanaca]
"It might be a little crooked... But it's not
something to worry about."

*stab*

[Taichi]
"I guess...it really is crooked..."

That twist in my nose started to bother me, since a
particular time of my life.
A time when I was starting to mature. A time of
fragile egos and self-hate.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

[Nanaca]
"What's wrong?"

"Was that what I had been like?"
Drawing spite and malice from my surroundings?
Did I seek justification through appearance, despite
being conscious of such things?
I've read something like that before, some sort of
theory.

[Taichi]
"Who cares about appearance. Even if the main
character is portrayed in a mediocre way in text,
they're always good-looking in illustrations."

[Nanaca]
"All right, I've had enough."

Nanaca looked like a secretary who had laid down
some sort of political judgment.

[Taichi]
"So what have you got to do with this human race
apocalypse syndrome?"

[Nanaca]
"Nothing."

[Taichi]
"No way... You're definitely lying."

[Nanaca]
"I'm telling the truth. The human race
just vanished on its own. I don't know why."

I stared back at her, frozen.

[Taichi]
"...You know about it?"

[Nanaca]
"I saw it."

[Taichi]
"You saw it?!"

[Nanaca]
"Yep. I saw it."
"The world slowly went into ruins."

[Taichi]
"Slowly?"
"How slowly?"

[Nanaca]
"Hmm, I'm not sure. I lost all sense of time."

[Taichi]
"It's strange. Everything was fine before we all
went to camp, right?"
"The camp went for three days and two nights...
So it took just three days?"

[Nanaca]
"No..."

Nanaca shook her head.

[Nanaca]
"It was more than that..."

[Taichi]
"That's weird. Logically, it doesn't match up."

[Nanaca]
"It's a matter of perception."

[Taichi]
"Whaa?"

I didn't get it.

[Nanaca]
"It doesn't help to dwell on what's already
happened."

[Taichi]
"That's true but...I didn't know humans could vanish
so easily."

[Nanaca]
"I think something happened, somewhere."
"Somehow, I just feel something wrong."

[Taichi]
"Somewhere?"

[Nanaca]
"It's really hard to explain with words, but..."
"Somewhere, I think there was a huge wave, and that
spread vastly."
"With my limited perceptive ability, that's all I
can say."

[Taichi]
"Are you some sort of...god?"

She let out a strained laugh.

[Nanaca]
"No, no, I'm not that amazing. I can't do anything."
"...I don't really know anything anyway."

[Taichi]
"Then, why are you here?"

[Nanaca]
"Hm, well I can't really say. I don't have the
capacity to say. Sorry."

[Taichi]
"Capacity, huh?"

I totally understood that feeling.
It was the same as me not having the capacity to
hang out with friends and live a normal life.
That's why I was sent to Gunjo.
Because I hurt people.
I'm dangerous, and I didn't have the capacity
to make friends.
It was true. Overwhelmingly true.

[Taichi]
"Then I won't keep forcing you."

[Nanaca]
"...Sorry."

[Taichi]
"No problem."
"But, still I don't know anything."

[Nanaca]
"If that girl tries hard enough, she should be able
to solve the puzzle."

[Taichi]
"That girl? Are you talking about Youko?"

[Nanaca]
"I can't seem to like her though..."

She pursed her lips.

[Taichi]
"You hate her."

[Nanaca]
"I wouldn't say hate... But I just don't like her."

[Taichi]
"Hmm..."

[Nanaca]
"After she cleans, I will swipe the window frame
with my finger and point out her inadequacies."

[Taichi]
"You think like a mother-in-law."

[Nanaca]
"Mother-in-law... That doesn't sound too bad."

[Taichi]
"Are you serious."

[Nanaca]
"Taichi."

Her voice sounded quite distant.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

An impossible distance.
Nanaca was riding side-by-side with me just a few
seconds ago.
20 meters. A distance that was impossible to travel
in a second.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaca]
"This seems to be the most convincing."

[Taichi]
"Hey..."

As I expected.
She wasn't human.

[Nanaca]
"You know about the shrine don't you?"

[Taichi]
"The shrine?"

"With that, and the information of the shrine, I
made sense of it all."
There was a connection.

[Nanaca]
"If you want to know, go over there!"

She pointed straight at me.
No, it was behind me.
The school.
No... The mountain?
It was the mountain trail we took to go to camp.
It was mostly animal trails, but we were still far
from the summit.
Beyond that.
There was a shrine.
I couldn't make out what was enshrined.
It was an old, run-down, small shrine.
Back then, it might have been the place where they
enshrined a disobedient god.
Now it was completely abandoned.
I wondered what was there.
With trivial thoughts running through my mind, I
turned back to Nanaca.
But she was gone.
Along with her bike.

[Taichi]
"..."

The new school term was quiet, with not even a
cicada singing.
