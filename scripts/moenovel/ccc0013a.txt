I gave a faint smile.
My cruel intentions got the better of me.
I snuck up from behind.
I was as silent as death.
And I crept ever-so-carefully.
How would I make myself known?
Maybe a loud noise?
One step. Then another.
Kiri seemed to suspect nothing.
If I hugged her by surprise...it'd seal my victory.
I could shut down any resistance before it started.
It would take no more than a minute to wear her out.
And then...

[Taichi]
"..."

All of a sudden...
A deep, animalistic intent welled up within me.
Not now, not now!
Kiri could get hurt.

[Taichi]
"..."

I took a step back.
Still made no sound.
Another step, and another, back to where I started.
And then, Kiri turned around.
She recognized my figure near the doorway
and was startled.

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

[Kiri]
"It's you... Kurosu..."

There was an air of rivalry hanging about us.

[Taichi]
"Yep yep. Your senior, Kurosu."

[Kiri]
"What do you want?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing."

She sharply pointed a finger to the door.

[Kiri]
"Then please leave. I don't have any business with
you."
