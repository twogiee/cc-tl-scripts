"Well then..."

I brushed my hair to the side.

[Taichi]
"Sorry to bother you."

[Miki]
"Thanks for your continuing business!"

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, Miki."

I stopped.
I had forgotten to tell her something important.

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"We're gonna resume our club activities soon."

[Miki]
"The club is?"

[Taichi]
"Pop your face in if you start feeling rough."
"That's what the club is there for, okay?"

Slowly, Miki's face showed signs of comprehension.

[Miki]
"Yes."

Other than delight, I sensed something else within
her.
