Touko was in the classroom.
I stayed loyal to the journal.
I knew she didn't have anywhere else to go.
She also wasn't strong enough to be able to stay
at home by herself.

[Taichi]
"Touko, are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"..."

She glanced my way, then averted her gaze.
There were countless hidden messages in that
single glance.
I couldn't sense her mood when she side-eyed me.
It simply looked like she was sulking.

[Taichi]
"Don't ignore me."

I pinched her cheek.

[Touko]
"Stop it!"

She slapped my hand aside.

[Taichi]
"But you were ignoring me."

[Touko]
"You should know why!"

She got angry.
I knew that was the first step to being with Touko.

[Taichi]
*pinch*

[Touko]
"Knock it off!"

[Taichi]
"You're early. We don't have classes today, only the
opening semester ceremony."

[Touko]
"There wasn't even an opening ceremony!"

[Taichi]
"And you're still in your regular clothes."

[Touko]
"I don't want to wear this school's crappy uniform."

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Touko]
"Because I don't wanna look stupid, all right?!"

[Taichi]
"Those are some pretty hurtful words."

It was obviously a misunderstanding.

[Taichi]
"It's just that everyone has their own way of
thinking."

[Touko]
"That's what society makes fun of!"

[Taichi]
"And so, that's also why we fight."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"How can we protect ourselves from their attacks if
we don't fight?"
"We have to act, behave the same way as they do, and
blend in."
"We have to possess those skills, right?"

[Touko]
"Why are you talking so serious now? It's too early
in the morning for that."
"And besides, there's no one left in this world that
you have to blend in with. There's no point in doing
anything."

[Taichi]
"So you just do nothing every week?"

[Touko]
"Every week?"

I spoke without thinking.
I had to come up with some misdirection.

[Taichi]
"That's right, wannabe-biddy."

[Touko]
"Whaaaat did you just say?!"

[Taichi]
"See? That right there!"

I used the tricks noted in the notebooks
and ignited Touko's flameless heart.

[Taichi]
"You'll reach the ultimate level of being an old
lady in no time if you keep on blabbering like that.
Well, you're already at the peak of turning so..."

[Touko]
"..."

Meltdown starts at 3, 2, 1...

[Touko]
"~~II"

She was pretty steamed up.
Touko's combustibility would fuel her survivability...
Or not. But for now, it was enough. Hang in there,
Touko.
I had sent out a battle cry to her inner feelings.

[Touko]
"Say something!!"

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

I dodged her attack.
The timing was now or never.

[Taichi]
"See ya!"

[Touko]
"Agh, d-don't you run from me!"
