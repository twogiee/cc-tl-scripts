The cicadas were so noisy.
Even though it was so hot.
They always tried so hard.

[Taichi]
"Well now..."

What to do from here...
Since the rooftop was under the blazing sun, there
weren't many places to cool off.
Of course, the nearby classrooms that I peeked into 
were in the middle of class.
Ms. Machiko was teaching a class in 1-E.

[Taichi]
"..."

I've really only had shallow interactions with her.
I always thought she was too ordinary.
But she's changed.
Anyway, someone was gonna find me if I kept roaming
around the hallway.
I bought a meal ticket at the unpopular cafeteria.
I went to the club room.
Tomoki was reading a manga magazine.
I struck up some light conversation.
At one point, Mammoth passed through
and caused a commotion.
He disappeared after that.

[Tomoki]
"Well that was close."

[Miyuki]
"We need a curtain on the hallway windows."

[Tomoki]
"It's not allowed, the school knows too well."

[Taichi]
"I got a plan."

[Miyuki]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I know how you two think of me. But it's not a joke,
I really do have a good plan."

[Miyuki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, get the machine up and ready. And get a
camera."

[Tomoki]
"Huh?"

...
...
...

[Taichi]
"How's this?"

[Tomoki]
"Camouflage, huh."

I had printed out a full-color picture of the room
with nobody inside. I had fixed it to the inside of
the windows.
It definitely looked askew, but it might fool people
if they only glanced at it.

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, this might just do the trick."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

I felt proud.
Miyuki returned from the toilet.

[Taichi]
"How was the toilet?"

[Miyuki]
"Wahhh!"

She cried.

[Miyuki]
"I didn't say anything about going to the toilet!"

[Taichi]
"Anyone could tell by the way you were fumbling
with your handkerchief!"

[Tomoki]
"Dead giveaway."

[Miyuki]
"Just because you noticed doesn't mean you have to
point it out."

[Taichi]
"This won't work! Too careless!"
"Too careless, or not careless enough, both are
just as bad!"

[Tomoki]
"What's your basis for that?"

[Taichi]
"It's in the guidelines on how to be a proper lady."

[Miyuki]
"I don't want to be a lady."

I was astonished.

[Taichi]
"Wh-what a thing to say..."
"You need a scolding! Bad girl! Bad girl! Bad girl!"

I circled Miyuki as I caused a commotion.

[Miyuki]
"Wahhh."

Miyuki was frightened.
Ugh. She was so plain.
I stirred her up a bit.

[Taichi]
"Bad girl! Bad girl! Bad girl!"

I slowly lifted her skirt.

[Tomoki]
"H-hey! Hey!"

[Taichi]
"I'll forgive your transgressions if you're wearing
wool panties."
"Buuut if you're wearing thin shorts or anything
like that..."

[Miyuki]
"Uhhhhhhh..."

[Attacker]
"Hiyahh!"

Who was that?

[Taichi]
"Gahh?!"

[Kiri]
"A female enemy!!"

An axe kick from behind, huh?
Just as I felt myself getting knocked unconscious,
something brought me back.
Something was different.
If I had fainted, I could've avoided the pain of
hitting the floor.

[Taichi]
"Ngh...that hurt."

She glared at me.

[Kiri]
"That's because it's obvious which of us is in the
wrong."

[Miyuki]
"Wh-who are you?"

[Kiri]
"A passerby transfer student."

[Taichi]
"Wow, Tomoki. This would make for one hell of a
picture, huh."

[Tomoki]
"I'm begging you. Don't say anything that suggests
I'm your friend."

Tomoki was cold and pretended to have nothing to do
with me.

[Taichi]
"Ack, ungrateful hypocrite."

Well, okay.

[Taichi]
"Hey, how 'bout telling me your name before I sing
you a final lullaby?"

[Kiri]
"Pervert!"

[Taichi]
"No, that's my name!"

[Tomoki]
"Man, are you dumb."

[Kiri]
"I'm telling the teacher on you."

[Taichi]
"Oh? And which teacher will that be, my darling?"

[Kiri]
"It doesn't matter."
"This is sexual harassment after all!"

[Tomoki]
"But you just met him."
"It's good to hear that the reporting of sexual
harassment is on the rise. Thanks for your support!"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry, my friend. This is me at my most
virtuous."

[Kiri]
"That you would try to lift up her skirt like that...
Despicable!"

[Taichi]
"Huh. How admirable of you."
"That's what you plan to tell the teacher?"

[Kiri]
"You guessed it!"

[Taichi]
"I wonder if a just heroine like yourself ever stops
to consider this..."
"Why would I try to lift up a skirt in broad daylight
with witnesses around?"

[Tomoki]
"Maybe he simply wanted to see how she'd react?!"

*super side fist*

[Taichi]
"And why didn't our Moral Committee Chairman Tomoki
Shima try to put a stop to it?"

[Tomoki]
"Whaaa?!"

[Kiri]
"N-no way..."

[Taichi]
"You heard right."
"That's why I have massive political sway at this
institution of learning!!"
"Right, Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"I told you not to involve me."

[Kiri]
"You!"

[Tomoki]
"Hey! I had nothing to do with it!"

[Kiri]
"I'll never forgive you! Not in a million years!"

[Tomoki]
"You know I have nothing to do with any moral
committee, don't you?!"

*super high fist*

[Taichi]
"Heh, heh, heh."

I put my hands in my pockets, closed my eyes as if
in meditation, and tried to look villainous.

[Taichi]
"That's why I have massive political sway at this
institution of learning!!"

I opened my eyes as I ended the sentence.

[Tomoki]
"You already said that."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"You said it too early, I think."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"And I heard there was no bullying at Gunjo
Gakuin..."

[Miyuki]
"Umm, I wasn't really being bullied."

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

[Miyuki]
"They're always like that. They didn't mean any
harm."

[Tomoki]
"They...?"

Tomoki looked dejected.

[Taichi]
"They...?"

I tried to look dejected.

[Tomoki]
"What reason do you have to look dejected!"

[Taichi]
"Because I'm no hypocrite!"

[Tomoki]
"I'm not like you!"

[Taichi]
"You wanna go?!"

We scuffled.

[Tomoki]
"Insipid Machiavellist!"

[Taichi]
"Sister complex murder case!"

[Tomoki]
"Low-earning imbecile!"

[Taichi]
"Earth debris!"

[Tomoki]
"Failed shareholder!"

[Taichi]
"Don't mention the damn shares!!"

[Kiri]
"A falling out?!"

[Miyuki]
"Ahh...well..."

[Tomoki]
"You're the one who told the world I had
a sister complex!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I said it! Told lots of girls, too!
Everyone was thrilled!"

[Tomoki]
"So that's why I'm called a pro, huh!"

[Taichi]
"That might be true!"

[Tomoki]
"I'm the one telling the truth!"

[Taichi]
"Damn it!"

[Tomoki]
"What?!"

*bam-bam-bam-bam-bam*
And...
We self-destructed.

[Tomoki]
"Wahhh."

[Taichi]
"Ngh."

We were both flat on our backs.

[Miyuki]
"Do you want to go to the infirmary?"

[Taichi]
"Where is that heroine from before?"

[Kiri]
"I'm Kiri Sakura. And I'm no heroine."

She looked down on us as she spoke.

[Kiri]
"And you also now understand that evil is not
aesthetically pleasing."

Tomoki sweated profusely.

[Tomoki]
"I-I had nothing to do with it. This is all
Taichi's fault."

Tomoki rolled up like a pill bug.

[Tomoki]
"Enough already. Let's go inside."

He started sobbing.

[Miyuki]
"You're crying?"

[Kiri]
"She seems okay, so I'll overlook this disgrace
this time and leave you alone."

[Taichi]
"You're gonna regret this... Just as soon as I get my
body moving again..."

There was scorn in her laugh.

[Kiri]
"Do your worst."

And that was how I met Kiri Sakura.
