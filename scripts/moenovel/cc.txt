If a cell phone had three signal bars,
it meant the signal status was perfect.
Only one was weak.
And even two was still fairly weak.
The signal bars almost represented power.
Three bars meant full power. It gave a feeling of
connectivity.
I don't remember exactly when I had
those kind of lucid thoughts...
Peaceful, boring, quiet, and automatic. When I
didn't have the energy to think, I amplified the
impressions and produced new images in my brain.
If I have three bars, I can pass through space-time!
And I thought I'd delude myself out of boredom
with that kind of middle-schooler idea until I died.
But in reality there was no time for boredom.
I could feel something wet on the tip of my nose,
like morning dew from fresh grass.

[Taichi]
"Uh, cold..."

I woke up.

[???]
"..."

There was a small girl nearby. Her name
was Mimimi, my step-sister.
She comes to wake me up every morning.

[Mimimi]
"Hey big bro, wake up already."

"Okay, then..."

[Mimimi]
"I'm really not able to handle myself without you,
big bro."

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

I laughed bitterly.
Recently, her actions had become more
precocious than before...
But it was time to get to school.
I pulled out the bicycle.

[Taichi]
"I'll leave you behind."

[Mimimi]
"Hey, wait."

I headed for school with my step-sister sitting
behind me.

[Mimimi]
"It's been a while since you last gave me a ride."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"

It might've been.

[Taichi]
"It feels...so soft..."

[Mimimi]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Your breasts... Um..."

They're pretty big and kept hitting me. Were they
always this big?
When did she get so big?

[Mimimi]
"Pervert."

*smack*

[Taichi]
"Ow."
"All jokes aside, I wouldn't mind
giving you a ride everyday, you know?"

[Mimimi]
"I have morning practices!"

[Taichi]
"I see."

[Mimimi]
"And you're always hanging around that person..."

[Taichi]
"That person... Touko?"

[Mimimi]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, there's nothing going on between Touko
and I. Don't be so suspicious."

[Mimimi]
"I guess so?"

[Taichi]
"That's right. Besides, hysterical women
aren't my type."

[Mimimi]
"You're more popular than you think,
you know that, big bro?"

[Taichi]
"Really?!"

I never heard that ever.

[Mimimi]
"There's even a fan club in my class."

[Taichi]
"But I've never had anyone ask me out before?"

[Mimimi]
"That's because they're restraining each other!"

[Taichi]
"Several girlies are restraining themselves
over me?!"

[Mimimi]
"Did you just say...girlies?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm. It's still hard to believe."

[Mimimi]
"I don't want to believe it either..."

[Taichi]
"Huh? What did you say? I couldn't hear you."

[Mimimi]
"You idiot!"

*smack smack*

[Taichi]
"Ow! OWW!"

She hit me.
I didn't have any clue why.

[Mimimi]
"..."

Then my unrelated sis just stayed silent.
I kept pedaling, still not having a clue.
The desks lined up geometrically in a classroom
that never changed, there was a deprivation of heat
from students in the atmosphere.
I approached Touko's desk and talked to her red desk.

[Taichi]
"Yo."

[Touko]
"You should think about what you do
before you take action."

[Taichi]
"About what? I don't know what you're talking about."

[Touko]
"People will think you're a sis-lover
if you're attached to your sister all the time."

[Taichi]
"Wha? What do you mean?"
"She might be unrelated but we're siblings,
you know?"
"I was only giving my sister a ride on the back
of... Hold on, how do you know that?"

[Touko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Did you see us riding the bike somewhere
on the way to school?"
"But you were here before I was..."

[Touko]
"Shut up, I just heard it somewhere!"

[Taichi]
"From who?"

[Touko]
"From a friend!"

[Taichi]
"Friends? Didn't you say you didn't have any
friends? That you couldn't spend time with
common people?"

[Touko]
"Nyang..."

[Taichi]
"Nyang, huh. Saying phrases like a heroine of a
video game."
"Do you happen to be jealous...?"

[Touko]
"Grrrrrah!"

She got mad, as usual.
I escaped into the hallway until class started.
Lunch break.
I saw Tomoki and Sakuraba. They were eating.
I joined them.

[Taichi]
"Heyo."

[Tomoki]
"Friendship is..."

[Sakuraba]
"Not asking anything in return."

[Taichi]
"Did you watch TV yesterday?"

[Tomoki]
"Friendship is..."

[Sakuraba]
"Not asking anything in return."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, is that right."
"Oh yeah, when I was browsing
this news site yesterday..."

[Tomoki]
"Friendship is..."

[Sakuraba]
"Not asking anything in return."

[Taichi]
"And now, a major debut."

[Tomoki]
"Friendship is..."

[Sakuraba]
"Not asking anything in return."

We had an enjoyable conversation.
They're bad companions but they're both good guys.
They don't participate in this story but these kinds
of friends that bear each other without ill intent
are hard to come by.
I spotted Kiri in the hallway.
A junior that yearned for me.

[Taichi]
"Kiri!"

She rushed over with joy when I called her.

[Kiri]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Have you eaten?"

[Kiri]
"I did."

[Taichi]
"You bring your lunch, right Kiri? That's nice."

[Kiri]
"Did you eat in the cafeteria?"

[Taichi]
"I did. I'm starting to get tired of it."

[Kiri]
"Then... Would you like me to bring you lunch?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, that's too much to ask for..."

[Kiri]
"I see..."

[Taichi]
"But maybe once in a while...
I'd like to try your food."

[Kiri]
"Yay!"

Seeing her happy made me happy too.

[Kiri]
"Then I'll bring one for you next time."

[Taichi]
"Great, looking forward to it."
"In return... Let's see... I'll give you this doll
I got from the arcade."

[Kiri]
"Ohh, thank you!"
"What doll is this?"

[Taichi]
"I dunno... Not sure what it's from. Maybe an anime?"

[Kiri]
"I don't know..."
"It kinda looks like you... See."

[Taichi]
"Does it? Really? Besides, my hair isn't that white."

[Kiri]
"Maybe so."

Kiri hugged the doll and gave a big smile.

[Kiri]
"Thanks, Taichi, I'll treasure it."

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it, it's not a big deal...
I didn't think you'd like it so much."

[Kiri]
"Purr..."

Kiri rubbed her cheek on the doll.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah..."

I was spent.
I went to the rooftop after school.
Youko was there. She's kind of...like my older
sister.
She lives nearby, good grades, and good at sports.
She takes care of me a lot but I've been shy lately.
She's the club president of the broadcast club.
Considering her abilities, it was without question.
She had taken over the position as president, since
her second year.
Her easy-going seniors had wanted to retire from the
position as soon as possible.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

She found me and approached me like a puppy.

[Youko]
"You're going to be at club today?"

[Taichi]
"Hmm, just checking it out."

[Youko]
"I see."

A perplexed look came over her face.

[Youko]
"Taichi, you're a member...
You should actually be here everyday."

[Taichi]
"Uh... Don't look at me like that."

Even with her good grades and athletic skills,
she was a bit of a crybaby.

[Youko]
"But but, you said you'd help out..."

[Taichi]
"I did... Say that...
But at that point, it was still..."
"Miki was alive then too..."

Big sister Youko's expression froze.
Miki Yamanobe.
She was my girlfriend.
Such a great girlfriend. Always made lunch for me.
But...
She died in an accident.
The memories still pierced my heart.

[Youko]
"Oh, sorry..."

I made her cry.
The guilt.

[Taichi]
"Ah, it doesn't mean I don't like you, Youko."

[Youko]
"Really?"

I looked around to confirm there was no one else.

[Taichi]
"Of course. I love you."

Youko's face shined.

[Youko]
"Then... Will you give me a hug?"

It started again.

[Taichi]
"Sure, come here."

Her mental age drops when she's being sweet.
I didn't mind as long as no one was watching.
Phew, tired.
I don't have any parents home.
They're both working overseas.
That's why Mimimi acted like my caretaker.

[Taichi]
"But... I have to protect her..."

Until she finds her happiness.
Until she finds the person she loves...
*bu-dump*

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

What is this pain in my chest?
Do I...think of her that way...?

[Taichi]
"Screw it, I'm not going to think about it anymore!"
"Sleep it off!"

...
...
...
With twists and turns, we made up.
And started to assemble the antenna.
To spread out our thoughts and friendship
through radio waves.
It was such a wonderful thing.
Misato...
Touko...
Kiri...
Sakuraba...
Tomoki...
Everyone, let's do it together.
And the tower was built.
The symbol of our club... The tower.
There were sheets covering it now.
And then an alien started raiding.
We used our Karade to fight back.
We unfolded our offense and defense up and down,
left and right.
And finally were able to come to terms and friendship
with the alien.
Friendship is awesome. Was everything possible?
The alien was also Miki. It was quantum mechanically
so.
But the alien was an enemy. A very sad thing.
That's why it was killed or be killed.
...
And as more time passed, the antenna was at peace.
But I won't give up. I'll keep fighting.
Dreaming the silly club activities.
The day of a normal student.
My memories as a person.
And the battle.
Continued...
I woke up. But my body didn't move.
Might as well sleep again.
I decided to go through some reflection scenes.
...
...
...
I stood there.
Misato was in front of me.
Misato is Mimi, who is also Mimimi,
the one and the same.
The memories before this weren't clear.
It was already in a different mode.
But I could tell that I was doing things
automatically.
I mimicked with all the knowledge and experience
that I've stacked up.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"W-what is it...? Did you need something
from me...?"

She was out of breath. And she seemed so nervous.
As anyone who was being chased would be.
And finally, I caught her.
A chance to shift to evil.
She was shivering when I approached near her.

[Misato]
"P-please don't come...
If we can just talk about it... Right?
Pekke... Calm down..."

I had the knife "equipped," before I realized.
Misato was so attractive.

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

[Dead Misato]
"..."

I fastened Misato to the rear seat
of the bike and rode off.
I headed towards the school.
Ah, this scene gave me deja vu.
That's right, the scene where I went to school
with my step-sister.
She woke me up in the morning, talked smack,
made breakfast, and charmingly hopped
on the rear of the bike. Oh, that unrelated lil-sis.

[Dead Misato]
"..."

Clear memory with no noise.

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"
"It feels...so soft..."

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Your breasts... Um..."

[Dead Misato]
"..."

*smack*
Leaning on her side, her head hit the telephone
pole.
That pain directly transmitted to me.

[Taichi]
"Ow."
"All jokes aside, I wouldn't mind
giving you a ride everyday, you know?"
"Besides, you're the one that leaves
to go to morning practice by yourself."

[Dead Misato]
"..."
"..."

[Taichi]
"That person... Touko?"

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hey hey, there's nothing going on between Touko
and I. Don't be so suspicious."

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"That's right."
"Besides, hysterical women aren't my type."

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Really?!"

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"But I've never had anyone ask me out before?"

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Several girlies are restraining themselves
over me?!"

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hmm. It's still hard to believe."

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Huh? What did you say? I couldn't hear you."

[Dead Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Ow! OWW!"

[Dead Misato]
"..."

School.
Touko.

[Taichi]
"Yo."

[Touko]
"Taichi...? What the... Is that blood...?"

[Taichi]
"About what? I don't know what you're talking about."

[Touko]
"What are you saying? That blood... What is that...?"

[Taichi]
"Wha? What do you mean?"
"She might be unrelated but we're siblings,
you know?"
"I was only giving my sister a ride on the back
of... Hold on, how do you know that?"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Did you see us riding the bike somewhere
on the way to school?"
"But you were here before I was..."

[Touko]
"Tai...chi?"

[Taichi]
"From who?"

[Touko]
"Hey, are you joking... Get yourself together."

[Taichi]
"Friends? Didn't you say you didn't have any
friends? That you couldn't spend time with
common people?"

[Touko]
"Nyang..."

[Taichi]
"Nyang, huh. Saying phrases like a heroine of a
video game."

I pulled out the knife.

[Taichi]
"Are you jealous...?"

I approached her.

[Touko]
"Ah, no, no......?!"

Tomoki and Sakuraba.
I approached them from behind.

[Taichi]
"Did you watch TV yesterday?"

They seemed to have said something.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, is that right."

I killed Sakuraba.

[Taichi]
"Oh yeah, when I was browsing this news site
yesterday..."

Tomoki squealed.
I killed Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"And now, a major debut."

[Dead Sakuraba]
"..."

[Dead Tomoki]
"..."

We had an enjoyable conversation.
They're bad companions but they're both good guys.
I spotted Kiri in the hallway.

[Taichi]
"Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"...!"

She ran when I called her.
I chased after her.

[Taichi]
"Have you eaten?"

[Kiri]
*huff huff*

We ran through the long hallway.

[Taichi]
"You bring your lunch, right Kiri? That's nice."

[Kiri]
"Don't come... Don't come near me!"

[Taichi]
"I did. I'm starting to get tired of it."

Run. Run.

[Kiri]
*huff huff huff*

There was an alarm going off somewhere far away.

[Taichi]
"Nah, that's too much to ask for..."

[Kiri]
"Don't come near me..." *huff* "Don't...!"

[Taichi]
"But maybe once in a while...
I'd like to try your food."

[Kiri]
"S-someone!"
"He's going to kill me, someone!!"

[Taichi]
"Great, looking forward to it."
"In return... Let's see... I'll give you this doll
I got from the arcade."

I pulled out my knives. Two of them.
I ran with both dangling from my hands.

[Kiri]
*huff huff huff*

I chased after her. The two of us running in the
hallway.

[Kiri]
*huff* "Y-you're insane..."

[Taichi]
"I dunno... Not sure what it's from. Maybe an anime?"

[Kiri]
"Haa, hah...ungh..."

She tripped.

[Kiri]
"Hya! Ah, ahh, hah..."

I instantly closed the distance.

[Taichi]
"Does it? Really? Besides, my hair isn't that white."

[Kiri]
"No, noooo!"

Zero distance.
I looked down at her.
Knives in both hands.

[Kiri]
"Ahah...hahaha...hahah..."

I smiled too.
That way, I wouldn't have to use these knives.
I grabbed her by the ankles and dragged her.
Kiri was smiling.
I mounted on top.
84\p...
I heard glass break somewhere.

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it, it's not a big deal...
I didn't think you'd like it so much."

[Dead Kiri]
"..."

Kiri's face struck the floor.
*flop*

[Taichi]
"Ahahah..."

I went to the rooftop after school.
Youko was there.

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Hmm, just checking it out."

[Youko]
"You..."

She stared right at me.

[Youko]
"I see... You can't return anymore."

[Taichi]
"Uh... Don't look at me like that."

[Youko]
"You don't have much longer... You're going to lose
the strength to live as a person... It's slowly
going to kill you."

[Taichi]
"I did... Say that...
But at that point, it was still..."
"Miki was alive then too..."

Youko's expression froze.

[Taichi]
"Ah, it doesn't mean I don't like you, Youko."

[Youko]
"Really?"

[Taichi]
"Of course. I love you."

[Youko]
"Then... Hug me. Be gentle."

[Taichi]
"Sure, come here."

She came near. She settled onto my chest.
Youko started to cry.
I firmly hugged her by the neck.
...
Let's build a tower.
Our tower.
To the top of the skies.
Foolishly.
Then... It wouldn't be so sad.
I could build it myself.
And call out to the entire world.
Maybe that way...
I went by Tazaki Mart on the way home.
Work progress was going well.
There were still some materials missing
but it was steady.
I obtained some food. I put it on my tab.
It had been a while since the world collapsed,
so maybe there wasn't any need to for a tab.

[Taichi]
"Right, Youko?"

[Youko]
"Right."

She was smiling. It made me feel warm.
Too gloomy. I immediately thought of something else.
But why?
I wondered if the notes were still there...
My heart tightened for a moment.
I wouldn't be able to make that distinction
in my current self.
All would be dark soon. Just like my heart.
Next day.
Classroom.
I waited.
The sunlight was bright.
I'll look up the effects of heat later.
The tower was really close to the sky.
But when it was complete, it would support itself.
No need to pay radio fees. There's no need for money
in youth.
Evil commercialism would perish. Once this tower was
complete!
No need to shorten texts to save on data usage.
Free distribution.
I'll pollute this society overflowed with information
with more free information!
...
I waited.
But there was no change.

[Taichi]
"Huh..?"

I felt Miki's presence.
I decided to go to Miki.
I opened the door without making a sound.
Miki was on the rooftop.
I went out on the rooftop quietly.
Miki was standing in front of the 'tower.'

[Taichi]
"Miki."

[Miki]
"PYF[E...!"

Miki murmured something.
I didn't know what it meant.

[Taichi]
"PYF? What?"

[Miki]
"U<UI is EzW. YW\aR?"

Strange, it didn't sound like any human words.
Maybe she wasn't a real person? That was a
possibility.

[Miki]
"C; ICKTzB4..."

[Taichi]
"Ah... You must be an extraterrestrial."

An alien!
The smile on Miki's face faded.
Maybe she could read my thoughts.

[Miki]
"...GLFS\aBW\aRT."

[Taichi]
"I see. That's alien language."
"You want to challenge me."
"But... If you reform and wish to join our club..."
"If you wish to engage in building our tower
then we'll give you a warm welcome."

[Miki]
"...CKA."
"GLF,S\aBW\aR."

I headed towards the tower.
Miki jumped out of the way as I slid by her.

[Taichi]
"Look, this is our tower... The friendship tower!!"

The incomplete 'tower' appeared
when I pulled the sheets away.
A rare beauty of everyone's strength combined.
It was really difficult to put the antenna together.
But it was finally done thanks to everyone's hard
work.

[Miki]
"..."

Miki was in shock.
There was no comprehension, she was frozen.
Understandable. It's hard for a being from
another planet to suddenly understand
what we do here.

[Taichi]
"We'll be able to communicate with the whole world
once this is complete."
"This is something I believe I need to do
for myself now."
"Lalala lala la lalala la lala lalala la la lala."

[Taichi]
"How is it?"

[Miki]
"...RB\aEW\aR,"

Miki smiled.
I didn't know the words but she seemed to understand.
It seemed like I wouldn't have to show
any Karade here.
Long live peace.

[Miki]
"3K...SB$W\aGLAYT\aX\aEL) 4IZT0; WUENQRW\aR: S\a...
TKD\a) FS\aBI?"

It felt like she asked something about Kiri somehow.

[Taichi]
"I don't know. Haven't seen her."

[Miki]
"C4W\aRT."

Miki's knees were shaking.

[Taichi]
"Oh."

I suddenly realized.
Kiri was right there. In the back area
where Miki couldn't see her.
I shaped her in the form of a swastika
and assembled her.
There was a lot broken here and there
but it was still Kiri.
It was post-Kiri.
But Miki was an alien, so I guess I didn't need to
tell her.

[Taichi]
"Are you cold, extraterrestrial friend?"

[Miki]
"E5...W\aF0QDFB; W\a."

[Taichi]
"..."

As soon as Miki turned around
she abruptly got on her knees.
It looked like she fell out of shock for a moment.
She murmured.

[Taichi]
"What's wrong? Is it hard to walk here
since the gravity is different
from your home planet?"

[Miki]
"4B\a: ... 4B\a: ... 4B\a: ...4B\a: ... 0QDK3D, 4B\a: ..."

She just kept murmuring. What a weirdo.

[Taichi]
"Hey, don't you think 'Adrien' would be a good alien
name?"

[Miki]
"...4B\a: ... 4B\a: ... 4B\a: ... 4B\a: ...
4B\a: ... 4B\a: ... 4B\a: ... 4B\a: ..."

[Taichi]
"So, Miki, you'd participate
in this club too, right?"

I tried to approach her and put my hand
on her shoulder but she sprung up.
And awkwardly took off towards the school building.

[Taichi]
"Oh, hey!"

She left.
...
I went home, bit into a potato, drank some water,
and lay in bed.
I had met an alien today.

[Taichi]
"But... I have to protect her..."

This blue earth. From... That cute alien.

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

My heart was pounding.
Was this love? Did it sprout?

[Taichi]
"Screw it, I'm not going to think about it anymore!"
"Sleep it off!"

...
...
...
I woke up.
It was still the middle of the night.
I had a bad feeling.
Because my senses had become even sharper
and covered the whole town.
...
...
...

[Taichi]
"..."

It was burning.
The friendship tower was burning.
A blazing tower.
That smell. That pressure of hot air.
There was no use. It couldn't be extinguished.
It was all going to ashes.

[Taichi]
"Shoot."

I had to remake it.
But was there any materials left?
It had to be made from friends.
How many friends did I have left?

[Taichi]
"No."

I had to do it, no matter how difficult.
Any dream can come true if you put enough effort
into it. Believing is power.
Tomorrow is made from hope.
It was impossible for this beautiful 'normal'
to be overrun and soiled.
It was the highest determination
and condition for a person.
Everyone said that so it must be the case.
So if I put my effort into it...
I widened my senses.
I could feel the gods within my power of perception.
There was one at school, headed outside.
I sensed someone somewhere in town too.
As for the city... I couldn't tell.
I'll put my efforts somewhere close first.

...
I spotted my target in the hallways. I stayed
silent.
Staying low, I snuck behind
and used my knife on its foot.
*slash* I swiped at her Achilles tendon.

[Miki]
"Gah?!"

A scream. I understood that.
Miki fell down, unable to walk.

[Taichi]
"ACHILLES-CUTTER!!"

I said it as if it was a line from a superhero
movie script.

[Miki]
"Ah... Ahhhh..."

That looked like painful buttocks
to fall on. How sad.
I shed a tear without emotion. It'll be over soon.

[Taichi]
"So will you become my friend?"

[Miki]
"PYF [ E? 5...4C?"

Miki didn't seem to be able to grasp
what was going on with her legs.
It must be because of her implants. I'm sure of it.
No, must be the rebound. That's it.
Just another victim of the curse of commercialism.

[Taichi]
"La lala."

[Miki]
"... Er"

She dragged her immobile legs and tried to get away.

[Taichi]
"La la lala lalala."

[Miki]
"EQE...3D...EQ#..."

[Taichi]
"YOU are my FRIEND."

A KNIFE to a FRIEND.

[Taichi]
"15 minutes of daily training could result in three
million friends country-wide."

[Miki]
"BUEW\a...BUEW\a\p\p\pz!!"

I installed the knife in Miki. Around her thigh.
There wasn't a slot for it so I had to make an
expansion.

[Miki]
"33###z!!"

An everlasting amount of juice came out
when the knife was pulled out.
She started to kick towards my face.
Amazing, even with her tendon cut. Miki had talent.
So I took my knife to back of her foot.
Automatic skewer.

[Miki]
"3..."

She blanked, staring at her own feet being stabbed.
Her leg dropped to the ground as if it died when I
pulled the knife out.
Looked like I could make FRIENDS easily.
I decided to steadily progress to the next step.
I knew that 'this' wasn't anything to be really
threatened by.
I seemed to have some talent, but I had never felt
terror like this before.

[Taichi]
"La..."

I had a knife in each hand.
I had to take the blood out.

[Miki]
"S\a4DW... S\a4DW..."
"S\a4DW... 0QDF... RH\aII: \aUTzQKTU..., PYF[E?"

First, clothes off her skin.
There was already no more resistance.

[Miki]
"D\a2\aYT\aQ\aED\a...UKI..."

flashed.

[Miki]
"z...EQz...XzXS, I: \aW; F\a...3YP\aYQ\azQKIU#...3ff..."

.

[Miki]
"EQz... 44$..."
"...VSLW\aEG. D\aFYT\a... UTzQTO..."

.

[Miki]
"Q\aTOMDTDQOGLT\aEGW. zW, 6MzW..."
"W\aM0QD... 7GFO4D\a (YV\aMDWGWQ..."

.

[Miki]
"3 F F F F F F F F F."
"3 F F F F, F F, F F F F..."
"4033333zzz!!"

[Taichi]
"?!"

Miki's hand moved.
She got the jump on me.
A heavy blow to the side of my head. I felt it
through to the core.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

Head wobbled. Vision went dark.
I was able to stay conscious, barely. But the knife
dropped from my hand to the floor.

[Taichi]
"Ah, ahh..."

There was a baton in Miki's hand.
She hit my head with it.
But she wasn't able to put much force in it
without lower body strength.

[Taichi]
"That hurt..."

Sharp pain as I breathed.
There was blood when I touched it.

[Taichi]
"I might get a lump on my head."

Severe pain. This might be a trick of hers
to have me vomit in a few hours and die.
Well, as long as I figure it out, I won't die,
so it's fine.
Fine.
Fine fine.
It was fine.
I'll... Go ahead and make her my FRIEND.
A quiet and safe FRIEND.
A FRIEND that lived eternally in me.
...

[Miki]
"...4H\az."

The blood spread.
All over the hallway.
All over the world.
Spread all over and became everything.
Like a blood bag.
FRIEND does not need blood. I'll believe it.
But it wasn't safe yet.
At the end, I put all my force into it.
Deeply. Miki groaned long and thin.
And then...

[Miki]
"...RGQ\azQKI..."

stopped.
Went against my will.

[Miki]
"PYF [EKBS, A) zSRGQ\azQKI..."

[Taichi]
"..."

My body wouldn't move.
Like it had gone numb.
But slowly, I regained my freedom.
Able to move again.
They were my muscles, after all.
So let's continue with our club activities.
I used it.
I used it well.
And then...

[Miki]
"..."

I used it up.

[Taichi]
"..."

How long had I been standing like this? It was
already morning.
I felt extremely awful. About to puke.
I left the area like a bug avoiding the sunlight.
...
I satisfied my hunger at the store.
I looked over the notes there.
That's right, I kept tabs here.
Everything lead to the past, it was so nostalgic.
I grabbed a pen with my shaky hands.
I roamed about.

[Taichi]
"..."

It was very quiet.
The heat of summer was overpowering.
I became more rational as I sweat, unusually calm.
Mankind had ended within a blink.
Without knowing how.
The population decreased instantly.
There was no way to cope with it.
No one will live through it. No one.
When that big picture was visible, I...
My strength and power blew away without a trace.
I was scared to be at my own house.
Because I couldn't guarantee that Mutsumi's dead
body wasn't there.
My memories were faulty.
I couldn't go in...
I was calm for now, but I might lose it at any moment.
...
I walked the hilly road. I couldn't determine where
to go.
Absent-mindedly, I moved my feet.
Hot.
My head hurt.

[Taichi]
"...... La."

La?
...
I came to the shopping street.
No one was around.
No one.
...
I stood still on the bridge that faced the town.
My heart was wrapped in the smell of green around
me.
What is this world?
A bad feeling abruptly squeezed me.
Like the taste of coal tar at the end of a sweet
toothpaste.
Why did it always end up like this?
Everyone had gone insane.
Why was I the only normal one?
Humans should have never been born...
...
...
...
It was morning when I realized. I was laying down in
an open field like a dead body. My headache woke me
up.

[Taichi]
"Youko... Youko..."

[Youko]
"What's wrong?"

[Taichi]
"My head hurts..."

Just like old times.

[Taichi]
"I'm going to...break again."

Youko wasn't there anymore.
"RGQ\azQKI..."
What was with these alphabets?
I didn't understand it.
I roamed about.
I roamed about.
I roamed about.
I came to a road on the hill.
I heard a voice from behind me.

[Taichi]
"..."

I stood still for a while.
I was so exhausted that I couldn't even sense
anyone's presence.
I replenished myself with water. My heart had been
damaged a long time ago.
Anyhow, someone spoke to me.
That voice was... Sakakibara.
There were still survivors around.
Wasn't a FRIEND though.
I think he said something along the lines
of the school rooftop and about Miki.
I ripped apart my dried lips that were stuck
together, and let my voice out.

[Taichi]
"Teacher, please become my FRIEND."

I waited a while.
But there was no answer.
There was no one there when I turned around.
I couldn't see my teacher anywhere, even though they
should have been there.
How long did I stand there for?
Or...
Or possibly...

[Taichi]
"Someone."

I couldn't go on.
...
I was on a mountain path when I realized.
My headache still hadn't gone away.
My head that someone hit was throbbing in pain.
My head felt like it was about to explode.
Pain vibrated in my head with each step.
But I couldn't stop wandering around.
Maybe if I stopped, I would stop permanently.

[Taichi]
"Ow."

[???]
"Are you okay, Pekke?!"

There was no one around.
...

[Taichi]
"Where am I...?"

[???]
"The shrine."

[Taichi]
"I know that already.
Tell me something I don't know."

[???]
"Then I don't know."

[Taichi]
"And, who are you?"

[???]
"Nanaca"

[Taichi]
"..."

They were gone.
...
I staggered around the road without knowing where I
was going.
Just me with a headache and a feeling of forfeit.

[Taichi]
"..."

Not even human.
There was no need to stay inside an empty shell if
there was no one.
An empty act was meaningless.
There was no one here to listen.

[Taichi]
"..."

Perish me.
Perish everyone.
I prayed.
Perish the whole world in front of me.
I ran.
An extraordinary pain ran through
the core of my head.
I ran without care.
I saw the town...
And something happened in that moment.
Someone, or some god, stacked two pieces of paper
and pinned it with a tack.
The presence of eight appeared.
I abstained from it. Out of instinct.
The presence of eight.
No... It wasn't possible.
No one had the ability to do that. It was
impossible.
The very idea was crazy.

[Taichi]
"Uhhh... Ugghhhh..."

I descended from the mountain. Quickly.
Everything had gone mad.
I couldn't be certain about anything.
I was aware of it.
Scared.
I was scared.
...
I came to school as if I was escaping.
I went to the hallway to see Miki.
She should still be there if she hadn't moved.
However...
Miki had become eternal.
Since she had become eternal,
her body wasn't there.
Because there was no need.
She had no need for it now.
Becoming eternal, she had no need for a body that she
couldn't move.
I thought that was good.
Honestly, looking at post-Miki was rough.
It would've been nice if it was pre-Miki.
I really thought so.
Why?
Why did she have to be a part of sacrifice?
It started to make me sick.
I couldn't forgive something like that.
It was as unforgivable as people
who don't pronounce their R's and L's.
And that's why I kept singing in La's.
The dried blood was nostalgic.
If only it was all like this.
I headed up to the rooftop.
The FRIENDSHIP tower was gone.
It had been burnt down.
But why was there no sign of it?

[Taichi]
"..."

Not even a trace of it.
I couldn't understand or reason with it.
I was getting scared.
Scared. Scared.
It was a phenomenon.
If I noticed one thing then everything collapsed.
...
By the time the rich black sky had painted over the
scarlet sky, I was lying in a field outside of town.
I had no strength. My headache was awful.
I couldn't move.
The only thing I could do was recall my memories.
Memories. The only thing that could save me.
I didn't know what kind of madness would devour me
if I ran into them while wandering around.
It's fine. I just wanted it to end.
So, I just dreamed of the times that had been good.
I pictured them in my mind. All the possibilities.
Stuck them together like patchwork.
Joked around and teased a lot.
It hadn't been perfect, but it had certainly been fun.
Humans are amazing.
Bonds are amazing.
People supporting each other are amazing.
It's all, amazing...
How much time had passed?
I was still in that spot.
What day was today?
I didn't have any sense of the days of the week.
I had the sense that I wasn't human anymore.
Then what was I?
God?
Who would say such cliche things?
God was an illusion.
So maybe I was an illusion.
That explanation was in good taste.
Hot.
Bright sunlight.
Burning.
I was being burned.
Because I was criminal.
Well deserved.
But it was painful.
"RGQ\azQKI..."
That phrase stood out to me.
Yes. I was listening carefully, but...
I recalled it.
Slowly and carefully.
Word by word.
"RGlo zQKI..."
"RGlo zQKou..."
"I loved you..."
Those beautiful words shined like water in a desert.

[Taichi]
"Loved... Me?"

My voice hurt.

[Taichi]
"Such a person... Like me?"
"Ah... aahh... Happy... That makes me happy..."

So happy.
If this was a dream then don't wake me up...
No, actually, wake me up.
The world was such a nice place.
Because there was enjoyment in continuing days
where nothing happened.
I think I could better next time.
I want to do it over again.
I had thought about living as a snail if I was
reincarnated, but living as a person again didn't
sound so bad.

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."
"Hah..."

This fever and headache.
It was making me see things.
Unconsciously talking in delirium.
Trifled by fever.
My brain was melting.
But at the very end, I was able to...

[Taichi]
"..."
