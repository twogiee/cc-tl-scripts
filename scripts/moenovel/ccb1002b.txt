"Okay then, it's about time to go home."

[Misato]
"Yes, you're right."
"We should call it a day."

[Taichi]
"Sleep when it gets dark, wake up in the morning..."
"That's what humans do, right?"

[Misato]
"Yes, indeed."
"Let's end our club activity here then."

Everything felt so natural.

[Taichi]
"Do you want to go home together?"

[Misato]
"We go opposite ways."

[Taichi]
"Is that so?"

[Misato]
"Big bad wolf knows where my house is already."

She looked at me with a disgusted stare.

[Taichi]
"Woof, I'm outta here. Woof."

Looked like it was time to withdraw.
But then...
She saw me off, waving with her tiny hands in front
of her chest until I was out of sight.
I felt my heart skip a beat a little.
