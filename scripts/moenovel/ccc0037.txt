The gate was made to contain people. It made me feel
uneasy, just looking at it.
Why was it designed that way?
It was made to keep people safe.
Well, it was a semi-isolated facility after all.
Not to worry. All of the dangerous people were gone.
There were only eight people left in the whole
world.
The normal townspeople were gone, too.
So there was no one left to hurt.
Mwahaha.

"...That's enough self-deprecation for now."

The gate was wide open like a gaping jaw. I went
through.
