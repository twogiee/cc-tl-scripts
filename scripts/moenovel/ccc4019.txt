Back to club activities.
Tomoki had finished with the wiring, so I set up a
table for the electronic components and put up a
tent to cover it all.

[Taichi]
"Better take care of the antenna too."

There were still a few problems, according to the
blueprints.
But it may not affect broadcasting.
Even still, it would be better to fix it.
I got to work.
Suddenly, I sensed something.
I looked around...
But, no one was there.
My imagination?... Maybe not...
I'd be an easy target up here.
It wasn't good to be up on this ladder.
That crossbow probably had a range of 20 meters or
more.

[Taichi]
"Just a little longer..."

Then Misato showed up.

[Misato]
"I overslept."

[Taichi]
"You're just going to sleep through life."

[Misato]
"Hahahah. No comment."
"Actually, everything is nearly done..."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Oh, the tent!"

[Taichi]
"The wiring is finished too."

[Misato]
"Did you do it?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, for you..."

[Misato]
"Wow! You can really handle anything.
Who needs that other guy..."

[Taichi]
"I'd like to take the credit...but actually, it was
Tomoki."

[Misato]
"..."

At first she was disgusted.
Then surprised. Typical.

[Misato]
"Tomoki helped out?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah I kind of made him."

[Misato]
"Yeah...but...he helped right?"

She seemed relieved.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, not bad, right?"

[Misato]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"By the way, I need to use the toilet...
Can you switch with me?"

[Misato]
"Sure. You did so much I can handle the rest alone."

[Taichi]
"It's a bit of a mess at the top, so we should
probably work on that."

[Misato]
"Okay."

[Taichi]
"All right, I'm going to handle business..."

[Misato]
"Do your thing."

Pumping my fist, I entered the school.
All right.
Time to get serious.
