[Taichi]
"Ahh, wait!"

[Miki]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Let's fool around a bit."

Miki stopped.
Since she had little experience, it took a while for
her to catch on.

[Miki]
"With only the two of us...?"

[Taichi]
"Well, as a matter of fact, I'm asking for us to go
on a date!"

[Miki]
"Date..."

She repeated meaninglessly.

[Taichi]
"I want a date with just two people closed into
their little world, not a three person date."

[Miki]
"I see..."

She understood it from being overwhelmed.

[Taichi]
"It won't take too much time."
"And besides, Kiri must have the urge to be alone
sometimes."

[Miki]
"Okay, well..."

[Taichi]
"Then let's head to the community without going back
to school."

[Miki]
"Oh, but I wanted to check out the school..."

[Taichi]
"Oh just forget it."

[Miki]
"Gyaaanya!"

I dragged her along.
Miki perhaps won't recover once she gets depressed.
She was fragile.
But that was normal.
Normal for a girl at least.
She was worried that Kiri wasn't around.
I just had to distract her for a week.
She would go back to usual.
But just deporting her would be pointless.
I had to get at least a few things from her.
