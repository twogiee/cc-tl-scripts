"Ngh..."

I was awake.
Seems I had fallen prostrate on the desk and slept.
I had a dream,
a dream that should have been nostalgic.
But my mood turned to melancholy.
In the end, people are living for their own sake.
In the midst of so many desires produced by a meeting of touches with other people.
To cool down my sweaty body, I head towards the rooftop.
