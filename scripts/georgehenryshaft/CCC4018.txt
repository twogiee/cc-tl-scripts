Noon.
I part with Tomoki and lunch alone,
//Some words just need to be verbs. Glad this is one of them. -GHS
in a cafeteria deserted of people.
//Going by the 0.108 formula, this would be around 2 PM. No wonder, then. -GHS
I spread jam on the Pain de Mie that I had brought with, and mechanically toss it into the stomach.
//Turns out it's a really specific kind of bread. It's sweet, so it should go with law. Er, jam. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...a poor man's eating habits these."
[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I turn my sight towards my back.
There is no one.
Just my imagination?
But I had the feeling that I was being watched.
//This would be a bit creepier with Tower of Friends inserted back in. Not unless someone finds psycho Kiri scary? -GHS
