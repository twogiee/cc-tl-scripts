[Taichi]
"So then, isn't it about time we went to sleep?"
//This is a new line from the console version, but he stretches three lines below already so it makes no sense. Cautiously leaving it out. -GHS

[Touko]
"Wof."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, you're so bad at chess for being a wealthy lady, Touko."

I stretch.

[Touko]
"...woof."

Results were 10 wins, 0 losses.
//10-0 = 7. No, wait, 10*0=7. Ahhh, right, 10/0=10? Math is hard. -GHS
On return from the beach, for some reason Touko seemed to be wilting, so to distract her I challenged her to a game.

[Taichi]
"Want some midnight snacks?"

[Touko]
"Wof."

Her head shakes left and right to the neck.

[Taichi]
"Well, to sleep then."
[Taichi]
"So, come here."

Called to with gentleness, Touko's face reddens.

[Touko]
"...wooof."

We get on the bed.
Hugging tight.

[Taichi]
"Mmmh."

Kisses on her nape again and again.

[Touko]
"...whfwh... nh... woohf."

[Taichi]
"By the way."

[Touko]
"...wof?"

[Taichi]
"Why are you going 'woof, woof'?"

[Touko]
"Because as a punishment for losing at chess you made me talk like a dog dammit!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, was that it."

I forgot.
//He might've, seriously. -GHS

[Touko]
"So, woof like a dog."
[Touko]
"...uhm... before that I'd have one question though... how long do I have to be a dog?"

[Taichi]
"Until your next victory at chess, Touko..."
//HACK sweatdrop Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"'ll be a dog unt'l death!"
//Lisp -GHS

She covers her face.

[Taichi]
"Well then, on this day and this moment I will be performing an hour of sexual acts, and if you can manage not to come even once, I'll let you off."

[Touko]
"..."
[Touko]
"Pervert."
[Touko]
"PervertPervert."

[Taichi]
"Uhyyy!"

[Touko]
"PervertPervertPervert!"

[Taichi]
"That is most certainly correct, ojou-sama."

[Touko]
"...one hour?"

[Taichi]
"Hai."
//screw it *chug* -GHS

She supports her chin on her elbow. Pondering.
When having sex, normally one hour is a slow leisurely reciprocal touch.
There's no need to rush, because we have time in excess, so it's a matter of course.
Looking at Touko, those seem to be the entirety of the materials for her judgment.
//See CCC0007 -GHS

[Touko]
"Fine then."

[Taichi]
"I think I'll win easy, yes."

Those words cannot be made to pass.
A provocation that lit a fire in me.

[Taichi]
"Dooo you now."
//Sex scene obviously missing. The sex alt scene in the console version is pretty funny, but like all sex alt scenes it relies on pre-established fourth wall breakage and they can't be easily imported. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Come on, guests in this house sleep on the floor."

[Touko]
"...ngggh, the floor's hard and I can't sleep on it... tightwad."

[Taichi]
"If a girl were to sleep next to me, there would necessarily be continued sexual mischief all night long."

[Touko]
"Necessarily..."
//To avoid too many apostrophe's (why is that not the correct plural really???) -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you can't sleep there, then you can use the bed in any room you like."

[Touko]
"...(nnngh.)"

Worried.
I can feel the misery in her eyes.
I can feel the misery in my heart, as well.

[Taichi]
"Di-, dissatisfied?"

[Touko]
"Fine... I'll sleep here, yes!"

Dammit, so cute.
I don't want to sleep away from her,
but if I spoil her she'll get problematic.
Touko would grow steady and quickly into uselessness. She would completely melt.
Just like she's candy.
That is why I will lick slowly but slooowly, taking my time.
//See CCA0015. Whoops. -GHS
...so as not to make her disappear.

[Touko]
"...Taichi, you're pretty unsparing."

Very much so.

[Taichi]
"G'niiight."

[Touko]
"Hard... hurts... sob."

She lies down over a thin futon spread out on the floor.
I lie down as well.
It felt like things had grown audibly quiet.
The lights of the stars become countless colonnades that comb the room from the window.
//Verb works better than noun here. -GHS
It was as if a different world.
//Ow ow ow stop beating me over the head dammit -GHS

[Touko]
"Say... Taichi..."

Words from my back.
//OMFG REVELATION HE WAS ACTUALLY LAYING ON HIS SIDE AND ON THE SIDE **OPPOSITE** FROM TOUKO'S!!! Also see CCD2002 for various reasons and science. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"Will we always be able to be... together, I wonder..."

[Taichi]
"Even if you said you don't want to, I'd still be coiled all around you."
//Suuubtly creepy. -GHS

[Touko]
"...heheh, then we should be alright I guess."

[Taichi]
"Where's this coming from?"

[Touko]
"Because, people have vanished right? So, someday the two of us too..."
//See CCD2002 again. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"If we do disappear, at least if we're together... it'd..."

Touko was asleep.
Together, then.
I had never given it deep thought,
to that idea of people not being there anymore.
Why did they vanish?
In what way did they vanish?
I have no materials whatsoever to be able to explain this.
//Same as above. -GHS
Youko-chan herself didn't say a word about this, either. She doesn't know, no mistake.
Even making use of her, merely estimating a cause is impossible.
//Suspiciously specific. -GHS
I gazed at the night sky out the window.
That is why there is no choice but to live together for the eight of us.
While hurting each other, while loving each other.
//HACK slower fade out instead. -GHS
