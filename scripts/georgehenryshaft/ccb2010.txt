Fun school attendance with Touko.
//HACK ADV mode returns -GHS
Thursday September 10, 1998 -GHS
Tou-Kou -GHS
However,
Touko had become sullen.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Say,"

[Touko]
"...pfui."

Barrier is extended.

[Taichi]
"O-key."

She's been like this all throughout morning.
Since I spent all last night deprived of my senses, I have absolutely no damn idea why.
Speaking purely as a conjecture, I might have done something while sort-of-sleepwalking during my faint spell...

[Taichi]
"...uh-huh."

Very likely.
From the very moment of rising she was in the lowest of moods.

[Taichi]
"Hee-y."

[Touko]
"..."

No dice, huh.
Touko had gone on alone ahead of me, and walking really fast.
I trailed close,
and lined up next to her.
Touko, with her high haughtiness, naturally does not want to even look my way.
There is a certain beauty there, I say, but its origin is not quite ascertainable.
Stretching over a hand, I attempt a talon grab on her chest.

[Touko]
"Yyh?!
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"Really, you don't have any boobs do-you-not!"
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Touko]
"KEEP SILEEEEENT!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ojou-samaaaaaa!!!"
//Unsure. Either a reference, or a joke on how what she's using is somewhat polite, see CCD2002 for more on Polite Touko (AKA Past Touko). -GHS

FSZ 17
{}I was comfortably revolving in a flight that drew a faint ridgeline yet the instant one part of the head contacted the earth suddenly the braking turned me into the axis of a wheel and while spinning at high velocity with a momentum comparable to a boomerang I merely pass by the landscape and break into a grove of trees.
//HACK font size to make it fit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Harakiri Fist... the invincible combat technique..."

The grandfather (late) that imparted Touko with her Iai as well as the many ways of the Art of War could be called an indomitable demon.
He was a terrifying celebrity in the martial arts community, what with the video of him killing a raging bull with his own bare hands leaked on the 'net.

[Touko]
"...grrrr."
//Hmmm, but the voice is nowhere near the Belly Beast... -GHS

And here is his granddaughter.
She was never expected to be weak.

[Taichi]
"MIZZ TOOKO, what are you angry for?" (-deth)
//It's correct like this; don't liek disagree or your st00pid. -GHS

[Touko]
"...pfui, stupid!"

Ahh, feels so good.
But I don't know why she's angry.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara-san, hitting people because of one's biological moments is not very nice, and that's my opinion as an innocent young boy."
//[Translator busy guzzling jet fuel error] -GHS

[Touko]
"Don't you say confused stuff and then claim to be an innocent young boy!!!"
//Adapted. -GHStillGuzzlingJetFuelSeriouslyTryIt
[Touko]
"Also it's not biology!"

[Taichi]
"Hummm. According to my data, Kirihara's menstruation should have approximately one week ahead---"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

!gain!
//a-gain? Continuation of joke above? http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%81%92%E3%81%84%E3%82%93 <- that imperial stamp looks, odd as it might sound but not for Cross Channel, quite promising. Splitting the difference and going with oddity for its sake. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...guh!"

Punched.

[Touko]
"How do you know that much! Just die!"

[Taichi]
"I don't need to die when I'm getting killed..."
//Did people die when they are killed again...? -GHS

[Touko]
"I don't care!"

I don't care, she says...

[Taichi]
"Well, getting so ill at humor the day right after you start living with a man, of course I'd find that incomprehensible."
//HACK doll now instead of two sentences below -GHS

Touko's visage suddenly lacquers scarlet.
This is no shyness, this is anger.
//HACK removed -GHS

[Touko]
"Why don't you ask that sternum of yours!?"

Stomp, stomp, stomp.
She walks on ahead.
My sternum...
Being a man, the area around my sternum is of course perfectly flat.
//Hopefully it's as silly as it is in the original. -GHS
...that's not quite it.
Ask what's inside my sternum, she means.
So, when was Touko last in a good mood?
When she immigrated in yesterday she was certainly bright and smiling.
//Insisting on immigration. -GHS
Then, there was how she sentenced a part of my soul to be burned at the stake---
//HACK quick pixel screen bump -GHS
Thump.
Dizziness.
Still unbelievable.
The grief of losing one's own child must certainly feel like this.
And now I am no longer able to depend on visual aids.
Imaginarily impregnated, the images of a countless amount of Idols cross over my mind.
//Let's say it's ambiguous what exactly is fictionally impregnated here. Let's. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Fare thee well..."
//See CCC3004, CCD2002 (most importantly) -GHS

With that out of the way, back to Touko.
Yesterday, certainly, once I was struck by the shock I totally lost my senses.
I went without dinner.
Also without breakfast.
Incidentally, I am very hungry.
Boom.

[Taichi]
"That it then."

Found the reason why Ojou-sama is in a mood so oblique.
Therefore, re-ingratiation should be simple.
Having understood, then there is room for the present grumpy grump to be enjoyed.

[Taichi]
"〜♪"
//TL NOTE: 〜♪ -GHS

Humming I began to follow the route.
Was the gate just left open like this?
//It's morning. What's the problem with this? (Well, it isn't morning, but let's leave THAT mess for a second.) -GHS
It's as if it's ushering us in.
I thought of this as nothing more than a hellish prison,
//獄 -GHS
but now it's as a gentle womb, a welcoming place where we can have peace of mind.
//lol lol lol the gate is a pussy -GHS
There are no people.
Not one, nowhere.
So only at school, only at the Gunjou Institute, do we have a natural place to meet and gather.
Dragged inside to carry on the past.
In truth, the fall of mankind was exactly as big a problem as expected.
//Kitsui means problematic in this case, but the way it's written is with キツ kitsu in katakana and the い i in hiragana. It's an absolutely common way to write this, actually, but that has never stopped Tanaka from playing over exactly this kind of expectations before. Since 'kitsu' alone can mean 'good fortune', which is in contrast with what he'd be saying. See below for further reasons to leave this ambiguous. -GHS
I think it would have become the finishing blow. For almost all humans.
To me it became the good news, to them, it is a slow and despondent death.
And that is why Touko couldn't but come to my home.
So ironic.
I went to the cafeteria.
There was sign of life.

[Taichi]
"Whoss'ere?"

No reply.
I approach the direction from which faint noises are audible.

[Sakuraba]
"...nnh"

It was Sakuraba.
Facing away from me, sitting on his knees on the cold floor, his shoulders straddling repeatedly.
//See below. -GHS
Seems like he's gnawing on something...
With undivided attention.

[Taichi]
"?"
//This doesn't make any sense translated flat. I strongly suspect it's a parody of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe6srxp1-9I see also below for more hints of !!!ZOMBIE SAKURABA!!!, but also remember Resident Evil takes place in September 1998. Hey, just like Cross Channel! -GHS

I stand behind him.

[Taichi]
"Sack?"
//May God have mercy on my soul. -GHS

I called over to him.

[Sakuraba]
"...Taichiiii!"

[Taichi]
"EEEEEKK!!!"

My kick spontaneously flew forth.
A forward kick.
Turning into a spear my toes cave into his face.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

Sakuraba collapses flat in silence.
And immediately rises. No damage.
//See CCA0013. Though the real reference would be CCA0023. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Whassat for."
//Not even questioning, as is his style. -GHS

He said, all cool.

[Taichi]
"Because you have a weird face, you son of a bitch."

[Sakuraba]
"...hu, it's residential trespassing."

I don't quite think he means the evil thing that he means.
//Regardless, there's a horror reference of some kind, so making it RE-related would still work. -GHS
That's why he's a most honorable idiot, after all.

[Taichi]
"Eating something?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yah, as you can see."

[Taichi]
"...curry bread?"

Sakuraba's favorite.
//It's not Chris's blood? Ah, right, Taichi and blood. -GHS
Looks like cafeteria leftovers.
//Which he may or may not have bought. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"There were some cases left here somehow."
//Because he may or may not have bought them. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"No one was eating, so I was helping myself."

[Taichi]
"Because that stuff's terrible, that's why."
//Absolutely not a single word regarding no one being there, the bread being insufficient, or any suspicion whatsoever. This scene is complete and total nonsense with regards to what happens later. Either Tanaka screwed up something bad, or this is intentional. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hu!"

[Taichi]
"Wipe that 'hu!' laugh off. It's annoying."
//フって + 拭って (+ 吹って?) -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"But it'll spoil."

Doesn't seem to be listening.
//I think he answered with the last statement. -GHS
Already all around Sakuraba were scattered a good number of empty wrappings.

[Sakuraba]
"You too, want?"
//ME AM APE -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Sakuraba]
"Well."
[Sakuraba]
"I will never push my righteousness on you."

[Taichi]
"Thanks."

Sakuraba doesn't care in the slightest about the coherence of a conversation.
//Unless he's in fact the only one who does. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Much obliged."
//See below -GHS

Smiles.
And bites into the bread.

[Taichi]
"Eating this stuff all the way from morning..."

[Sakuraba]
"Yah. This might be the last curry bread in my life."

Eating as if his life depended on it, this Sakuraba.
It's more like he was wrestling with that curry bread.
//Monkey! -GHS
However,
the cafeteria was a blind spot.
//His reasoning for looking for more cases? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...is there any other type of bread?"

[Sakuraba]
"Was."

[Taichi]
"Past tense, huh."

All eaten then?

[Sakuraba]
"Don't need anything but curry bread, tossed the rest."
//The Touko connection. This is the crux of everything. -GHS

A kick flew.
With intent to kill.
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...hu!"

I lopped off his medulla oblungata. Sakuraba tumbled down like a branch chopped off.
//AKA decapitation. Still a zombie. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...why are you always like this!"

[Sakuraba]
"Much obliged."
//Actually wanted to leave these as "Etiquette is adequate", since it's not like these are meant to evoke more than a WTF from the reader. -GHS

He calmly stood up and said that.

[Taichi]
"Didja split yer mind!"
//Kansai. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Where'd you toss them!"

[Sakuraba]
"Forgot."
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Punch to the Face.
//Nothing to do with Karade, this is just a good ol' socking. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...it's reaaally heartening to have a friend like you in a crisis situation!"

[Sakuraba]
"Don't worry 'bout it."

Criminally clueless.
But I'm still the more important.
//Literally "I'm still cuter", but given it makes no sense in this context and the whole thing in the Miki route, going with this. It's only slightly less odd, though. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dammit, there's nothing leeeft!"

I continue to inspect the multiple stacked crates.
//The implication continues to be that the quantity's not small. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Found it!"

It's croquette bread.
Sakuraba's naivety proved fortunate as there was a whole lot left.

[Taichi]
"Isn't there some then!"

[Sakuraba]
"It seems that things are that way."

[Taichi]
"I'll be taking all this stuff now."

[Sakuraba]
"Do as you please."

I came into possession of food quite easily.
Predictably, Touko was there.

[Taichi]
"You're quick on your school commute."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And yet you came to school in normal clothes again?"
[Taichi]
"You really manage to wear that hot-looking thing often, can't you."

Ignored.

[Taichi]
"Hey hey."

Shrugging my shoulder, I sit in the seat next Touko's... mine.
I gaze at her profile.
It might be murderous quietness hers, but there is awareness of me, and I know.
//Visuals -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry for last night."
[Taichi]
"As you said, I tryed asking my sternum."
[Taichi]
"Indeed there's Bad."
//These two sentences sound intentionally off, see below. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But we're fine now. I and you both have that Happy."

Touko makes a very faint movement.
Turning my way.

[Touko]
"...you're always like this, Taichi."
//This whole thing makes a hell of a lot less sense if Taichi's lines above aren't somewhat off. Of course it's subtler in Japanese, but, welcome to linguistic differences. -GHS
[Touko]
"It's like nothing of me never even catches your eye."
[Touko]
"So quick to be alone... acting so egotistically."

[Taichi]
"Don't I now. I better make some self-reflection."
//Still off in the same way as above. -GHS

[Touko]
"I wish, just a bit, that you cared."

[Taichi]
"And on that thought... I came ready."

[Touko]
"Ready?"

I drop a small mountain of croquette bread on Touko's desk.

[Taichi]
"So, appease your fasting to your heart's content!"

[Touko]
"NOT THE POOOINT!!!"

PoPoing.
//Matching SFX -GHS
And still, Touko's belly bug cried.
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Touko]
"Hfwhat?!"

[Taichi]
"Belly bug."

[Touko]
"Th-, this is something else!"
//The point, the belly bug -GHS

Poing, poPoinnng.
Belly bug.

[Taichi]
"The Belly Bug: Again."
//vs. The Ninjawarriors Again -GHS

[Touko]
"I'm telling you this is a separate matter!"
//The point, the belly bug (again) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hiding it is pointless, don't you know I am able to converse with belly bugs?"
//See CCB2002. -GHS

[Touko]
"......what?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, this means you're hungry."
[Taichi]
"Incidentally I'm hungry too."
[Taichi]
"Therefore, first period class is on croquette bread."
//See CCC0025, CCX0001. -GHS

I tore open a package, and give a first bite.
Very happily it hadn't spoiled.

[Taichi]
"By the way, it's about time we reconciled."
[Taichi]
"...should be the moral thing to do I guess."
//HACK different doll -GHS

Touko looked stunned.
But,

[Touko]
"...heh."

She quickly chuckled.
//HACK shy Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"'Class', that's the first time I've heard that word in a few days."

[Taichi]
"But aren't you coming every day. Wait, wouldn't you be having classes all alone?"
//HACK normal Touko instead -GHS

[Touko]
"...seems so, yes."

She took the bread in her hand.

[Touko]
"I was really looking forwards to dinner last evening."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, are you just using me as some convenient co0k now..."
//Hee hee snort. -GHS

[Touko]
"I-, I am not!"
[Touko]
"...I was just thinking, we could eat together."

[Taichi]
"We're doing that now."

[Touko]
"...yes, yes. The guy who never understands understandably doesn't understand."

[Taichi]
"?"

[Touko]
"Enjoy your meal!"

She begins to eat while still angry.

[Touko]
"...so good."

[Taichi]
"All is delicious when hunger is present."

[Touko]
"...it's not just that, you!"

A fleeting flirtatious glance.

[Taichi]
"What else is there?"

[Touko]
"It's... the ambiance that's so important you know."

[Taichi]
"Is it. I don't really get it though."

[Touko]
"It's that, uhm... well, if things don't become pleasant, or something, you can't get the taste."
//Vaguened to fit response below a bit better -GHS

[Taichi]
"But it's really delicious! The sauce is quite dense."
//Specified to fit above. -GHS

So I said while munching with a munch-munch.
//Who am I? Who am I? I AM DOCTOR FUCKING SEUSS THAT'S WHO AM I. -GHS

[Touko]
"I mean, I mean, aren't things different when eating together?"

[Taichi]
"How?"

[Touko]
"Ugh..."
[Touko]
"What if I wasn't here any more, wouldn't you be all alone Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Eh, so you don't want bread anymore? I'll finish it later then."
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Touko]
"I mean that when you're eating together with someone you like it's tastier whyyy don't you ever understand what I am implying so that I need to hit youuuu!!!"
//BTW, if it's not clear from the DOCTOR FUCKING SEUSS line, Taichi was being an asshole again. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Being beaten alreadyyyyy!"

[Touko]
"...obtuse."
//Although the closest meaning as understood in the West is 'donkan'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The heart of a maiden is just like English. I totally don't get it."

[Touko]
"Siiigh, all those dreams of a former Girls' School student, seems not one of those will come true now."
//Ugh, these conversation cuts. I don't see why she would call herself a girls' school graduate, since she was sent to Gunjou before graduating. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And the dreams of men will also never come true, you know."

[Touko]
"Which?"

[Taichi]
"...that there'd be an Event where all the pretty maidens with emphasis on maiden vow en masse to be sisters in lesbianhood."
//And the couplings will make little sense, there'll be like one funny line per 3000 line episode, the sex scenes will be about as arousing as watching concrete dry up between bricks, and the rest will be dull as--- uhm, I mean see CCA0013 -GHS

[Touko]
"Gross."

[Taichi]
"Don't call it gross! It's a dream!"

[Touko]
"Do all men engage in warped delusions like that?"

[Taichi]
"If you call that something warped, then those Burusera bastards are non-terrans that dwell on Alpha Centauri."
//HACK Tanaka must've really been in a "let's embarrass Touko as hard as possible" trip in his edits. I thought this was a direct Nanaka reference, with this it still is but not directly. Wonder if that's what she told her in her rants while she held him. Term googles. "Non-terran" returns exclusively in Another Story. -GHS

[Touko]
"Burusera?"
//HACK new line, replaces previous one. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's OK if you don't worry about it."

Or should I say, you really should not worry about it.

[Touko]
"Is that related to Sukuburu?"
//HACK new line -GHS

[Taichi]
"...why do you even know about Sukuburu... well, that doesn't matter."

* Sukuburu = term that indicates a general School
  Swimsuit (Sukumizu) and Buruma fetish.
//HACK last added line. Likely due to the new stuff in CCB2009. Explained so no further notice, except... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buru_people Also, this may be awesome, this nazi here is written the same way in Japanese: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Skubl -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because right now, it's all something my hands will never touch again."
//Dreams? Porn books? His mother? Buruma? Yeah, mostly buruma after all the changes. -GHS

[Touko]
"?"

She tilted her head, dubious.

[Taichi]
"So, what's your dream?"

I ask, while my cheeks are inflated like a squirrel stuffing himself with bread.

[Touko]
"...stop it, don't make that face!"

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Touko]
"I don't want to see pre-winter hibernation Taichi."
//冬眠前 <-> 冬子 also see CCA0030 -GHS

[Taichi]
"...but really, this pre-hibernating squirrel-like me is still the same Taichi!"
[Taichi]
"And in the end the Mystery of Why is Ojou-sama in a Most Foul Mood, continues, doesn't it."

[Touko]
"............"

Oh?
She was embarrassed?!

[Touko]
"...sob."

Whoa,
she started crying.
I'm weak to the tears of tender young girls.

[Taichi]
"Aaaah, I made you cry... but how!"

NervousTwitchyNervousNervous
//Uhm, is it clear enough that Taichi's acting like a complete mood-killing jerk throughout this scene, or do I have to start spreading furry'ses all over it again? -GHS

[Touko]
"...unhappy."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Touko]
"Unhappy, so unhappy!"

Once again had Touko-ojousama's Age of Disobedience begun.

[Taichi]
"What could possibly be that's making it unhappy? If there's anything I can do I will you know?"
//Specific -GHS

Touko raises her face with a definite sternness.
//キッ と + キット -GHS

[Touko]
"Because you're unhappy with living with me, Taichi!"

Le petite trick du description?!?
//Fwench. -ish -GHS
It's about me now!
//Curiously these two lines were removed. I don't get why, so, uhm, they're staying. Don't worry; I understand Tanaka's writing perfectly. I cannot possibly make mistakes! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huuuh?"

[Touko]
"...be-, because yesterday you didn't do anything..."

[Taichi]
"Didn't I faint yesterday, because of a certain somebody!"
[Taichi]
"Hum, not done anything? Is that the reason you're so much in ill humor?

Eh, then that'd be...

[Touko]
"What now!"

[Taichi]
"You wanted to have sex?"

I made my thumbs (both) peek out from the depth of my fists.
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Touko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"............"
//I'm always unsure with this stuff, because it might be "..........." as well as "............." -GHS

Touko trashes me without a word, and I take the beating with just as much silence.
What a beau-tiful harmonie preetablie that was.
//Still killin' that mood dead. Accents missing due to shift-RETARDis. See CCCD3003, too, for how this term is also pretty ironic. -GHS
And then to the bread again.

[Touko]
"...sob!"

She is moved to tears.

[Taichi]
"......"

Really, she's so simplistic.
The world's been annihilated yet all carefree she jumps into a love affair.
It's true... Touko doesn't have other places to run away to.
And the one who did it... was me.
//OR WAS HE? See CCD2002. What she did was the exact identical same thing that she did already once before. -GHS
The way I frolic changed her.
//See CCB0018 -GHS
A recompense...?
//Good and bad. -GHS
Or maybe a burden?
Whatever the case, I had the duty to stay with her until the end.

[Taichi]
"wHell then!"
//Intentional -GHS

Touko was a bit shaken from that.

[Touko]
"...what now?"

[Taichi]
"I've decided. I shall become Touko's Prince!"

[Touko]
"........................eh?"

Hyper drawn in.

[Taichi]
"Worry not. I know of the desire for a prince that you have at the deepest levels of your consciousness."
[Taichi]
"Come at me with all your strength!"

Touko scowls at me with a sleeper's half-open eyes.

[Taichi]
"Then... shall we sex?"

The sleeper's eyes became dots.

[Touko]
"Hwehhh?!"

[Taichi]
"So, strip!"

[Touko]
"Wh-wh-wh-wh-?"
//Na-na na-na 7x2 -GHS

She darts her eyes around, flustered.
//Can't seem to fit the visuals here. -GHS
Good, this seems a good place for Touko's favorite signature phrase of mine.

[Taichi]
"MIZZ TOOKO, ZE COURTING TO YUU."
//Original is a pun between 求愛 courting, pronounced Q-I. -GHS

It is now signed.
//Guessing a pun between 決めセリフ as signature phrase and "line that makes her decide to do it with me". -GHS

[Touko]
"You-, you-, you-... you really want to?!"

[Taichi]
"Excessively so."

[Touko]
"......"

Ashamed.

[Taichi]
"What is it? After the stomach's full, it remains to satisfy the libido!"
//See CCB0025B -GHS

I took her hands.

[Touko]
"Wanting to satisfy the three big desires in a specific order isn't acceptableeeeee!!!"

[Taichi]
"So, some suitable kissy-kissy then, to improve the mood."

[Touko]
"That's not acceptable either, no!"

[Taichi]
"Do you prefer it forceful?"

My eyes shined with a sparkle of light.
//if you lick the screen it's gonna taste like grape -GHS
I extend my hands towards her clothes,

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes, yeees!"

with a want to denudate.
I strip off her shoulders.

[Touko]
"Uhm, but it's, school, we're at school, ah, AAAaAA〜w???"
//See CCD2002. When's that been a problem? -GHS

Bewildered,
pitifully so.

[Taichi]
"You need not worry! Yes, I'll strip you more, so show me your moderate breasts and your pair of peach pink Nipply-kun!"
//beechi-kun. Looks like they got anthropomorphized as well. Any more and he'll have total chuu-, oh, wait, too late. -GHS

[Touko]
"You, CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN'T!!!"
//ー=ェ then ェx14 -GHS

Seh-mack!
//that or pentatonic scale -GHS

[Taichi]
"K'yuh!"

I lost my senses.
When I was awake, Touko was not there.

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

And this won't exactly be her first time.
//Sex, her disappearing... CCB2012 says sex. -GHS
...Pretend-a-Lovers' hard.
Let's go to the toilet.
