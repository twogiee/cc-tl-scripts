"Whew."
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Fuu, the wind, the pretense. -GHS

On the table was laid a memo.
                 『There's dinner perhaps』
//Slight passive-aggressive, and centered as well. That latter one is so suspect. This should be Youko/hallucination, but it could be read as Yusa's mom, who keeps feeding him. Hell, for all we know it IS. The dinners are suspiciously never seen, and it's just odd that Taichi would want to hang around Youko for lengths of time. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Weeee, I'm coming I'm comiiing!"
//Curiously, "weeee" has precisely 4 e's. -GHStuffingCommentsWithUselessInformation

I don't need to make it myself then.
//That means he doesn't need to make food himself. ...which he never shows to be really capable of until like Sendback. The point is that he seems unable to call for delivery food. -GHStuffingCommentsWithUselessInformationThatDoesn'tTurnIntoUsefulIsHard
I changed my clothes in three minutes then cheerfully headed towards her house.
'Twas a most pleasingly delicious dinner.
//Formal and old-fashioned. -GHS
I ignite a candle.
//Hum, this gets only a 6 in pretentiousness. -GHS
A very peculiar radiance illuminates the room.
I loved candles.
//See CCE0001. Hmmm. -GHS
Their raw flame captivated me so strongly.
When I looked at the flickering flame swaying so absentmindedly, my heart was enraptured and I could just doze off endlessly, endlessly.
//Specifically doze off, see below. -GHS
Once, I even singed my bangs in it because of that.
OK, that was like three minutes ago.
//intentional change of tone. Hum, that's exactly as long as it took him to change. And while it's a joke, the thing above with the candle reads very much like he lost his memory there, didn't it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...singed... dammit."

It's to cry.
Anyway, to the diary.
I open the thick diary book.
//HACK dim BG -GHS
The records of life are really precious.
//HACK BG with Touko pic. -GHS
Today I went to school, but cut class.
Touko was extremely crabby and mean.
Must be that time of the month.
But it's not nice that she gets eight kinds of angry because of biology.
//This just reads like a preschooler's diary. 八つ当たり does just mean "outburst of anger", but it's got a nice number 8 八 right there which is as coincidental as these letters appearing on screen just because I press keys on a keyboard. -GHS
As revenge, I'll do mean things to her in this diary.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

[Touko]
"No! Stop!"
//This is a parody of really crappy eroge writing, but because translations of this tone are not exactly consistent ("eye-bleedingly awful" is not a style), going with purple-ish for tone. Several things here will also recur, so it's best for them to be distinctive. -GHS

[Me]
"Heh heh, no says your voice, but your body

     here has evidence (snip)"
//I take those to mean that what he's truly doing in this scene is simply force-feeding her. Very telling of the kind of "monster" he actually is, and very interesting considering Yusa and her mom. See CCZAS: not the only time he does this with boring standard eroge dialogue. -GHS

[Touko]
"Ahh, but that, no, stopit! Stopit!"
//This is so bland-nukige there's no saving it. -GHS

[Me]
"Not happening, when a man has come this far

     there is no retreat! I can do nothing but
     acquire lock on the target that you are with
     the rifle of my pride!"
//TL Note: that means his penis. If that's Youko, that still means food, since she's the part that can make it. (Yes, Taichi cooks WITH HIS DICK.) See CCA0007. Hum, given some of the currently-recent nukige translations, maybe I should just add random pointless sesquipedalianisms. Because when one thinks "readership target of low-budget rape nukige", that's obvious "people who know what 'cachinnation' means", right. -GHS

[Touko]
"NOOOO!!! My body, my body

        you caaaaan't!!!"
//Romeo Tanaka's beautiful prose, everybody, that even to remove one line is to ruin everything. I wonder where most alleged Tanakafags got that cliche' from... uh, not that I really disagree with it, I mean, this scene is still necessary in like twelve different ways. -GHS

[Me]
"Soon you'll come to covet this yourself!"
//...I just wonder how many of those who dress themselves up with that cliche' are so poor at reading comprehension that they never actually noticed that this scene is supposed to read as really really really silly. -GHS

[Touko]
"NOOO! Have mercy!!!"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karu%E1%B9%87%C4%81 This, in particular, will recur. It's one of the few technically non-Christian references. It generally won't work, cough cough cough. -GHS

[Me]
"Do I look like I have ears that know how to

     hear? Hyaaaa!!!"
//TL note: this means he's not listening to her. See CCC3004, where this will have its payoff. For now, compare Sakuraba, who just can't hear right from one hear (though it's psychological). Certainly Taichi has no issues with hallucinations in both cases, see Nanaka, possibly Youko. -GHS

[Touko]
"...animaaal!!!"
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

Close-up of a vase containing a red rose here. Soon afterwards, cut the flower at its base, that it falls to the ground in silence.
//HACK actually implement it :-) -GHS
The screen blurs, whiteout.
                           【FIN】
//HACK BG with Miki pic. -GHS
I was walking down the corridor to find Miki cleaning.
//I CITED FAMILY OF DEBAUCHERY IN A SERIOUS ANALYSIS, BEAT THAT ASSHOLES -GHS
The tips of my fingers fired towards Miki's ass with the speed of lightning, but merely grazed and couldn't seize the substance.
//The three lines are split on the console version anyway since the font is way bigger, so character limit's no issue here. -GHS
But Miki had been slow up until now, enough that I could touch her as much I liked.
This is a most alarming problem, Headmaster!
//Doesn't seem to be a reference, though the multiple references to the headmaster are as odd as the almost random ones to Mutsumi that are spread around. -GHS
However, a pupil growing in skill is something to be honestly happy about.
The day when she surpasses I, her mentor, grows near.
//HACK BG with Misato pic. -GHS
Went and had club activities for the first time in a while, and got all squishy-squishy with Senpai.
//fig. head scrunched between the boobs. Curiously, the PS2 and X360 versions both have different terms instead of ぱふぱふ (いろいろ "all sorts" and いちゃいちゃ "ICHARABUlol" respectively) -GHS
On this day I have finally managed to reach a goal point.
I am moved to tears, lots.
//HACK disarm new stuff -GHS
And lots of other stuff happened, so overall it was a good day.
//It's just there to trick first time readers into thinking the flashback events are simply glossed over rather than nonexistent.. -GHS
