In the end I wanted to eat lunch here.

[Sakuraba]
"Hoy, Taichi."

It was "Curry Bread" Sakuraba.
He really loves the hyper spicy curry bread they served here.

[Taichi]
"Curry bread even with the fall of mankind."

[Sakuraba]
"...have some."

[Taichi]
"Don't want it."

[Sakuraba]
"If I eat this up, then I'll be eating the last ones."

His face clouded.
And behind it, cases packed with bread where piled up into a tower.

[Taichi]
"...when did they bring these in?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yesterday didn't they?"

Yesterday.
Certainly today's a half-day but bread's still on sale.
//Opening ceremony. -GHS
Fundamentally, holidays excluded, this cafeteria is always in operation.
There was the opening ceremony, yet still bread was brought in.
Indeed.
Therefore, until yesterday, the world was being properly maintained.

[Taichi]
"Still, the number seems insufficient."

The number of cases seems not one-tenth of the normal.
//It's apparently because Sakakibara-sensei brought stuff in, see CCC4025; except, of course, see CCB2010 - Sakuraba tossed almost all of the non-curry stuff. This discrepancy is simply explained: Taichi thinks this is the number total of cases of bread, while Sakuraba thinks he's talking about the number of cases of curry bread alone. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Because the opening ceremony day is half vacation perhaps."

[Taichi]
"Still... insufficient."

[Sakuraba]
"Besides, me, I don't think humanity has fallen."

[Taichi]
"Come again?"

[Sakuraba]
"I dare say: couldn't this be but a city-wide game of hide-and-seek? And that is what I predict."
//See CCC0016A. I think he's playing Taichi's game as well. Not that it matters, the guy lives in a literal another world. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's delusional."
[Taichi]
"And those weren't the words of a prediction. You sounded like you gave it thought and made a conclusion, didn't you."
//Of course. He's also perfectly correct. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hu! ...fastidious this guy."
//The 'hu' laugh, see CCB2010. For something that should be just a simple writing error there's lots of pointing this out, isn't there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha smile all satisfied now."

[Sakuraba]
"But there is nothing to worry about."
[Sakuraba]
"With the passing of time, I expect everyone to come back. That's according to my calculations."
//Wonder if they involve 0,108. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......me's optimistic, but you are optimistic at a cellular level ain't ye."
//That katakana ore... is he being infected? -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hu."

Why this guy is even around wounded boys and girls I don't know.
//Did he forgot CCA0022 now? Very interesting. -GHS
That seriously worried me.
And Sakuraba presented this worried me with some curry bread.

[Sakuraba]
"Eat."

[Taichi]
"Don't wanna!"

Shot down.
