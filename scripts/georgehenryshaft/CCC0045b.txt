On the way home,

[Nanaka]
"Heeey!"

Nanaka was right next to me.
As if manifested all of a sudden...

[Taichi]
"Ah, Nanaka..."

[Nanaka]
"In spiriiits?"

[Taichi]
"More importantly, that hokora---"

I was embraced.

[Taichi]
"N'uguh?"

[Nanaka]
"You said fun, and if you can say that, 's all right."

[Taichi]
"No, I didn't say that."

There is no chain of logical connection going through this conversation, however,
what is even with this sudden Emotionally Moving Event...
Anyway, be that as it may.
The ambiguous softness of a breast.
The scent of a girl.
Inexplicably, I feel nothing out of order.
The feeling at the moment of embrace was so different from Youko-chan's.

[Nanaka]
"Those words... they make me happy. Really."

[Taichi]
"But I didn't say anything..."

[Nanaka]
"Because never becoming strong is not a disqualification from living."

[Taichi]
"Listen to what you're being told!"

[Nanaka]
"Remaining weak is... still fine."

[Taichi]
"You listening or not!"

I didn't understand any of this.

[Taichi]
"I'm really glad to have experienced the tactile feeling of your chest."

[Nanaka]
"...too honest."

[Taichi]
"It's just that I didn't get this at all."

[Nanaka]
"Sorry, I mistook you, 's all."

[Taichi]
"For what?"

Nanaka scratched her head.

[Nanaka]
"A different one."

[Taichi]
"Explain in ways I can understand."
//Curiously it's not tagged /*, they probably forgot as it's the same audio file -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Say you, it looks like you're setting out on helping the construction on that antenna, but how's progress?"

[Taichi]
"Listen here."

[Nanaka]
"W'at?"

[Taichi]
"Let's talk so that I can understand. First... first up is..."

[Nanaka]
"First?"

[Taichi]
"Of course, there's a lots and a lots, but..."

[Nanaka]
"Theeen one single solitary question I'll give you an answer to. Ask me anything and I'll answer, OK?"

[Taichi]
"Co-, color of your panties?"

[Nanaka]
"Today they're white. But they're reeeally cute tho. They totally match the bra!"

[Taichi]
"Pure whiiite..."

I reflect nostalgically on the girl's underwear.

[Nanaka]
"Well, the questioning round is with this brought to a close."

[Taichi]
"Woooooh, dammiiiit, what about the mystery of this wooorld!!!"

I fired off a question by refleeex!

[Taichi]
"I am so stupiiid!"

[Nanaka]
"Also perverted."

[Taichi]
"...takebacks are a nope?"

[Nanaka]
"Nooo-ooope."

Nanaka crosses her arm into a X, making the Batten mark of denial and failure.

[Nanaka]
"Next chance, 'K."

[Taichi]
"WhMnhMnhMnh... failure..."
//???????? -GHS

And there I suddenly had a sharp thought.
My my, this one... couldn't she be the culprit?

[Taichi]
"Nanaka-san... I do have one question..."

[Nanaka]
"I told you that any more are not happening!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, right."

[Nanaka]
"When we see each other next week, OK? If you get done what you should be doing, Taichi, you'll manage to get there."

[Taichi]
"Manage to get where?"

[Nanaka]
"This way."
//個々に, here + individually -GHS

Smiling.

[Taichi]
"Hmmmmmmm."
//Counting the dashes as other Ns... -GHS

Somehow, I was thinking of her as a Key Person, but... she doesn't seem to be relevant.

[Nanaka]
"Did you go to the hokora then?

[Taichi]
"I went."

[Nanaka]
"...you didn't look inside, right?"

[Taichi]
"I didn't look, now that you remind me."

[Nanaka]
"Go look."

[Taichi]
"Nah, I just don't really want to go that place anymore."

[Nanaka]
"...well, there's no need to really hurry so it doesn't matter, but..."

[Taichi]
"That's the place where Youko-chan sleeps, so I don't really want to go barging in there."
//Did he bury her there or something? -GHS

[Nanak]
"Hmmm. But that girl, I think, would have wanted you to go there!"

...does she know of her death as well?

[Taichi]
"I'm so ashamed that I can't even look at her face."

Not when I am someone who isn't exacting revenge for you, Youko-chan.

[Nanaka]
"That may be a cruel thought."
//Notice she's answering to his thoughts. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How come?"

[Nanaka]
"You're saying you're too ashamed to even look at her face because you're not equal, don't you see?"
[Nanaka]
"If you look it from the opposite side, it's wanting the other side to become equal to yourself, that's what."
//Well, no. If Taichi can't even look at Youko, then the implication is always inferiority, even when superiority is stated. No need to get in cultural polemics: since Taichi correctly believes Youko to be a wimp underneath it all, this may just be an implication of that reality. And, also, that Taichi can't look at Youko because he's the one who killed her, provided she ever existed at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah... right."

I recognize the inconsistency.
//...though even assuming the argument above makes sense, calling it a "contradiction" is stretching it. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"If you can accept that there's dignity in referring to peanuts as Seeds of Persimmon, then not accepting a weak companion that stays weak is kinda odd isn't it."
//Told you they were important. See above for the weakness part. If one can accept peanuts as seeds of persimmon, then one can accept as human what, by the standards of the world, isn't. This would mean Taichi has not forgiven Youko for what she did, not yet at least. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ain't it. Kaki no Tane's Sakuraba thing tho."
//If Nanaka points to the hokora, and Sakuraba points to Nanaka... -GHS

She seems to even have knowledge of my past.
Anything goes when it comes to her doesn't it...

[Taichi]
"Well, if my mind changes I'll maybe give a try and go."

[Nanaka]
"'K!"
[Nanaka]
"Me too, yannow, I don't think I'm qualified for human relationships."
//It's about time this were revealed to mean nothing of what it sounds like it does. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"The thought that Taichi is the same... it makes me happy."
//Think about this for a second: what mother would really be happy for her son to be an antisocial recluse? "Not qualified for human relationships" doesn't mean that; it means he's someone who seeks something higher than what's available in the world. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

Dammit, so cute...

[Nanaka]
"Give it all on club, too. True Companions may die, but still give it all. You'll be all right, because next week you'll be all laughs."

[Taichi]
"Whoa, don't say imprudent stuff!"
//See CCA0030. Hum, if Kenneth Broadcast Channel would reveal that everyone's insane, this reveals... -GHS
[Taichi]
"We got two dead dammiiit!"

[Nanaka]
"Ahhh, just in case, I'ma telling you that I didn't kill them, right?"

[Taichi]
"EHHHHHHHHHHHH?!"

[Nanaka]
"...you were sure I had killed them, weren't ya?"

[Taichi]
Well, yannow, when it looks like you have inexplicable powers, couldn't you you transcend alibis and tricks and all that and be free to murder? It could be said to be a Murder by God. Not that it's a whodunit novel or anything though."
//Eight people, no one else - no one else at all... isn't this just the ultimate closed room mystery in a sense? But if the culprit is chance... then at the very least, it having been picked to be 'chance' is not, itself, random. This is Blessed Luck, meaning the culprit is, in that lateral and not-straightforwards sense, indeed God. This also hints at the motive: since no one dies, death alone can't be the point at all. This is subtly but pervasively anti-nihilistic. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Huuum, God might be close I guess, and very much so."
//And she said it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And while we're talking whatever, here's my house."
[Taichi]
"Want some jams? Shall I give you some?"
//Original is string bikini + intestine meat bread. This one you prolly gotta dic tho: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jams -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Nope, don'wann'em. Gimme that stuff and I'll just boom throw it away."

[Taichi]
"Dooo you now..."

[Nanaka]
"Going home now. Bye."

And abruptly I thought,
//These are my favorite lines to tee ell. Not to edit, because 'pasting these by hand is a PITA. -GHS
where would Nanaka even go home to?

[Taichi]
"Bai bai."

The bicycle Nanaka was riding vanished on the opposite side of the hill.
//Not her...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
