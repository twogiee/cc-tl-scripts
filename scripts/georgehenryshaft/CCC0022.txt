I push the door open.
There was opposition,
a push back from the opposite side.
I push with strength.
On the other side of the door, a tiny bit of foggy turbolence dispersed.
//霧 -GHS
It was the wind.
An antenna.
That's what it's acquiring the shape of.
Directionality and wavelength and more, all sorts of tuning is required.
//See CCA0029 -GHS
However, I am not an expert on any of those things.
Senpai also wasn't particularly well-informed, but she seemed to be studying diligently.
//He just said he barely even remembers! And it doesn't matter since he read the diary, so he should know she can put this together. -GHS
And that Senpai... is not here.
Tools,
stepladder,
books,
empty packets of sweet bread, scattered around by the wind.
//See CCX0001. Ah, she likes the sweet things because Still a Child then? -GHS
All that is left behind are the vestiges of fatigue work.
She hasn't even worked for 24 hours after all.
I look up at the antenna.
The surroundings are open, the building is tall.
//Except for the mountains that look taller than the antenna. Not that it matters. -GHS
This seems an ideal environment to make electromagnetic waves fly out.
A Community FM, to clarify, is a local-based radio broadcast.
By nature, this is not something at the low threshold of the accomplishments achievable in a school club.
But.
The location, the purpose of Gunjou Institute, the ideas of local volunteers overflowing with good intentions:
all those things join together into this here.
The assembly was proceeding, but, because of a certain inevitable incident, it was all left incomplete.
//He could be meaning that the incident couldn't be overlooked or anything else... but Taichi telling Yutaka to kill himself wasn't avoidable in the slightest. It was simply fate. It is also where the end for the Broadcast Club was first really visible, and for those who haven't paid attention yet, the inevitability of downfall of the status quo is kinda an important thing here. -GHS
This antenna had been brought in and, for a year, left in this condition.
Those were the circumstances and the reasons for this.
Perhaps the item boldly demanded of the Gunjou FM had, as contents, a love filled with the aspirations of brave boys and girls, but,
//See CCA0015B (keeping some terms consistent) -GHS
sorry, that's something that doesn't exist in Gunjou.
It could be said it turned out awright in the end.
//Some lines I really don't know if Tanaka's trolling or just trying too hard. -GHS
Misato-senpai started her SOS Project.
//計画 -GHS
She said she would on the night of Sunday,
after we had split up and verified that mankind had completely vanished.
Because of the heights involved in the antenna, trying to complete it and attempting to send out a transmission... are actions that manifest an exceedingly scarce sense for the materially possible.
//Curious that no one here is acrophobic... but I doubt that's meaningful. -GHS
Honestly, I thought Senpai had just become frayed.
//Recurring term for diving into one's ultramarine -GHS
Flight gradually makes a person weak.
And Senpai was more than weak enough from the start.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun?"

From behind.
I turn around.

[Taichi]
"Hullo, Senpai."
//OHAROO GOZAIMASU -GHS

[Misato]
"Hullo then... uhm, what do you need?"

[Taichi]
"I came to see how things are."

Senpai makes a fluffy and enervated smile.

[Misato]
"So you did."

[Taichi]
"I did not come in for a while, but still this is some considerable progress."

[Misato]
"I have been doing things like this steadily and diligently for quite a while."
//Both the antenna and being on her own. Interesting continuing implications that was working on the antenna long before the training camp as well. -GHS

True.
Since the natural downfall of the Broadcast Club to now,
//Title of Week 2. -GHS
Senpai has been doing everything all alone.
Manning the intrascholastic radio on lunch break,
with broadcasts of all sorts.
Everything.
There was no longer any help from anyone.
Kiri came to see me as an enemy,
Tomoki came to avoid his sister,
Miki made forced nervous smiles,
Touko also began to ignore me.
A collapse, a magnificent one.
Sakuraba alone never changed from his always.
And, unchangingly, he cut club.
I nevertheless hung around Senpai, but,
it was her who refused assistance.
//heee heee ass -GHS

[Taichi]
"...so you did."
//Similar to her own filler words, this one seems contrast-y enough to be worth pointing out. -GHS

[Misato]
"This was surprising, all things considered."

[Taichi]
"Really now."

[Misato]
"People vanished, and all at once."
//I.e. there's a surprise among a surprise, ergo her previous line. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So quiet, is it not?"

[Misato]
"Very but very quiet it is."
//We should be hunting wabbits perchanche. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Where did you just go?"

[Misato]
"Well... I was a bit hungry, so."

[Taichi]
"This is noon. Were you able to find food without problems?"

[Misato]
"Ahhh, I had to go back home. I have no particular shortage of food."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, you cut schooool. Prez is a cutteeer!"

[Misato]
"N-, not true!, this is not cutting at all!"

Flustered,
because she is a person that stresses regulations.

[Taichi]
"Suspension, there will be a suspension!"

[Misato]
"Suspension is baaad, it will stain my recooord!"

[Taichi]
"Suspension! Suspension!"

[Misato]
"Suspension is unacceptableee!"

We made merry with the two of us.
//bout time there was some frolickin'. -GHS
That was the shortest of distances for us as we are now.
