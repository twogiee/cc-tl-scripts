Mutsumi-obasan is nowhere to be seen, as it always is.
In her stead, a note is laid on the table.
            『There may be no absence of dinner.』

[Taichi]
"I'm coming, I'm comi〜ng!"

I leave the house with spring in my step.
One good thing of countryside is that the evenings are not sticky damp hot.
The wind that slips through the window is cold with moderation, and gentle on the skin.
There's lots to write today.
The diary, of course, but I also got to do the script.
I think I'll get things done starting from the script.

[Taichi]
"...uh huh."

Suitable content for the pilot broadcast, then.

[Taichi]
"......"

{}DIFFICULT.
Write then erase then write then erase.
Offense and defense in an advance and retreat.
One hour later, I fall prostate on the desk.
Come on, come ooon, I only gained two lines!
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
『We are known as the Gunjou Institute Broadcast
 Club. The area within the range of this broadcast
 has presently become our exclusive possession.
 All present must speedily discard their armaments
 and---』
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"No, no and no!"

I tear up the Japanese writing paper with its neat squares, and toss it.
//Since most would be mercifully unfamiliar with it. -GHS
I aimed too far towards playing to the crowd and trying to get laughs, and totally got off the poooint!
//*looks back at first revision, coughs conspicuously* -GHS
Better do this seriously.
I went to add too much subtle funny on it, and it just got weird.
//I'd wonder if the first revisions of Tanaka's stuff are readable at all, but given CCZAS is likely not edited very thoroughly, I don't have to doubt much. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I quit."
//YamEda Hajime? -GHS

This evening I just can't get into the mood.
Let's write the diary.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
Make those emotions objective!
//Odd this'd be in the diary, but let's consider how it's likely started as a school assignment. Mystery's all but solved there. -GHS
Who was it that first took the curry out of
the curry bread and ate that with rice?
//The joke is that he thinks curry didn't exist before curry bread, but the point is a recall to Sakuraba. If you can understand how Sakuraba's meant as the reading key here, despite him never having done this and in fact hating curry itself, then you may be starting to understand how to approach Cross Channel. -GHS
That is the doubt that forever hails
difference on young little me.
//Boku. -GHS
  * Hailing difference[sic]. Meaning 'to
    torment', a logic error where a sense
    of physical discomfort makes Taichi
    conflate being different with the hail
    of teases that often come as a consequence.
//差違子の記憶は? Adapted as "namu" is also hail or prayer, so went with another meaning for 'hail'. The typo version reads sorta like "variation". Rest is well and adapted, as we got our first 違和感, the Sense of Physical Discomfort that so often's found around Nanaka and Youko, and generally stuff that perhaps simply should not be there. This is definitely an error that began at the Mansion. -GHS
    Similarly, due to having mistaken 'turtleneck'
    for 'totalneck', to this day Taichi firmly
    believes the name 'totalneck' must come
    from how the sweater totally encloses
    the neck.
//There's way too much text to respect the console version 1:1, but IMO it looks less cluttered like this anyway. -GHS
The end of these days without number spent
repeatedly going abound and abound on these roads
indivisible could leave nothing but the faint
rub of a sensation of emptiness.
  * abound and abound[sic] = around and around
//The flow of this is suspect: it's obviously difficult to connect this thought to the curry bread question, and trivial to think of this as something completely different. It's true: it's a description of the time loop ("roads indivisible", a ring, a loop) and the arguable worthlessness of this endless repeating. I take this to be intentional: the crap up there was to distract readers enough not to notice the topic has changed. Not that Tanaka himself doesn't do sort of the same at times, cough cough. -GHS
Baudelaire said this:
                 『God is dead.』
//Friederich Nietzsche. If you take this seriously, you're mincemeat. -GHS
But to doubt the existence of God is to take
things simply, for in a life believed to be as
linear as the straightest of roads, where the
days are lived giving no assent and denial
neither to this existence, what is known as a
Prank of God will yet with a sudden profit
carrefours.
  * Profit[sic] = prepare
//Best troll is this: the kami is not generic, as it refers to Nietzsche's phrase. He couldn't be talking about anything but the Christian God. -GHS
Ex{ae}mpli gratia in the classroom, when this
so heirless a conversation developed with a
most headstrong female.
  * heirless[sic] = fruitless
//Also see CCA0013, CCA0014A/CCA0014B. Error's the same in both languages. This is about Fixed Existence, which Touko's also heading towards. -GHS
Ex{ae}mpli gratia, when in the corridor I
simultaneously met an intimate friend and
an estranged friend both.
//See CCA0015A -GHS
And furthermore, in the while the two fellows
were building a most amicable relationship.
//'Toki'(time/occasion) is written in kana this time when he used kanji so far: he's going into sexual delusions. Or is it? This "building" is the same used by Misato in CCA0015B; it means the same as Taichi's growing of hearts. The next line, however... -GHS
This humble one, with regards to the both,
whilst unable to be unfeeling of xxx (painted
out via mosaic)'s volition of proud towering, the
heavenlike mystery of the pair's equal endowment
of xxxx by xxx in which approach the nose to kiss
and xxxx's edge for which the unstinted love there
together present xxx that xxxx with regards to the
action to take xxx and at the end xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.
//The first three summed give 7; 1+6=7; 46 plus that loose 3 is 49, which is 7x7. Every single part here boils down to 7. The sum is 86, which is 7+1 and 7-1. (OK, maybe that one is pushing it.) This is considerably funnier considering how many hints there are in the Kiri sex scene(s). -GHS
          『Whereof one cannot speak,
           thereof one must be silent.』
These are Kierkegaard's famous words.
//Same troll as above, repeated. This is the reading key for CCD0021. -GHS
Allusions to Kiri-jou's modest androgyny,
and the just ardor this one has with regards
to the said, shall be left with this.
//The number 7 hidden in the government-mandated gaps of what should be a sexfest, itself a metareference to the Hasekura mansion (nukige), break via misattributed postmodernism, and then a reference to androgynity. This is about Youko, this sentence is about purple-colored badgers hopping themselves in a frenzy making use of the word poing, it's not even that complex and illogical in the end! -GHS
For the joys of life are not merely these.
Hence.
//Just being pretentious for tonal consistency. -GHS
A fortuitous encounter on the rooftop with the
guide of Our life, Misato-jou, that howevermuch
I were to write about the display of hands-on
affection allowed by her motherlike magnanimity
the myrrh would be most inexhaustible.
  * myrrh[sic] = mirth.
//See CCA0010. Motherlike, Nanaka, Misato the Angel, Youko the URMOMs. -GHS
First, whatever I may say, her so plump
thigh(remainder under censorship review)
//The thing about the thighs = the lolicon thing. And after that big ultra-rightwing rant, discussing Misato getting censored has an entirely different meaning. And it's particularly funny considering how much CC had to be massacred to be allowed on the PS2. -GHS
And so in my hand it remained, that
chestcloth that so much learned of her flesh.
//Same as the 'groincloth', direct reference. -GHS
On the moment of a respiratory act through the
item already parting with that warmth by body
induced, the faint subodorare of young woman in
an instant whisks me into a delusional world of
delusional delusion.
                                            ~FIN~
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
It is accomplished.
//But not finished: despite the above being just explicit delusion, that garbage is now leaking right into his reality. -GHS
It is overflowing with poetry and furthermore philosophical,
//It is hideously purple and violence-inducingly idiotic. If there wasn't meta... speaking of which, remember that odd 'philosophical' thing Misato said? I do wonder if that isn't the hint. -GHS
a surge of authentic literary talent that if I had been born in that capital of the fine arts London, stardoming would've been the foregone.
//I strongly suspect this should be Paris... except in England, between the '30s and 1949, at an Oxford pub called The Eagle and Child... Engine doesn't accept the accented e in eclat, so the machine translator that I only edit stuff from defaulted to sorta-engrish. Still works because, once again, this is about ridiculing the half-educated who'd think this stuff is impressive instead of pretentious and laughable. -GHS
Naaah, 'tis just a put on airs mine, I'm just using tortuous verbiage here!
//Sarcastically making self-disparaging remarks, which instead are honest, see below. IMO it's too blunt, but I'm sort of biased in that regard. -GHS
Weltanschaaung, countenancing, intratextuality: those are the kind of technical terms that I got to use like bullets in a machine gun without translation into plain language.
//Same SFX as Miki used about Kiri.　Original terms (term, tautology, irony) would make this way sillier than intended; could've used Japanese VN terms like imouto, but that would make this way more meta than intended as well. See CCX0001: this would be the mud water that covers the sewage. And yet, after all this, I could only say that it's the exact opposite. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nnnh..."

I have a stretch and relax.
Being a writer's not bad.
It's unfortunate that there are parts too extreme for modern day Japan which needed to be censored.
//This uses the exact same PC term for censorship as the thing about Misato's thighs. This is about the excessively polemic, anti-governmental, inevitably anti-Japanese-culture (and intrinsically pro-Christian) parts, not the porn. -GHS
Right, let's go with the same feeling for the script.
I shall embroider a dazzlingly flowery Broadcast Picture Scroll with pedantry as its ornament, and output an advanced and furthermore subtle script worthy of being heard by the intelligentsia.
//Do you embroider those picture scrolls...? Not that it matters in the context of prose purple enough that angry violets look pale blue compared. This script is where it's impossible to deny that Tanaka is completely and utterly deriding the people who believe the point of Cross Channel is the purty language, when it's simply nothing of the sort. This is the garbage that Taichi vomits up to cover the truth, and as seen from the analysis above, he actually knows said truth. -GHS
Inspiration struck in a sudden, and once again I took to the pen.
