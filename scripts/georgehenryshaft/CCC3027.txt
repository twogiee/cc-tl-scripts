Time flowed quietly for about five minutes.
Kiri did not even cry.
A theory says that tears are the stress that flows outside of the body.
Kiri is not crying.
...a very deep despair is precipitating.
The sediments of her feelings, accumulated at the deepest of her heart, are precipitating.
I waited, gently,
in the immediate vicinity,
for a long time.

[Kiri]
"...how come..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"How come... he never said anything?'

[Taichi]
"To you, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"Because you adore Yutaka too much, Kiri."
[Taichi]
"And that adoration is completely pure, as well."
[Taichi]
"...maybe it's pure, or maybe it's just fleeting."
[Taichi]
"But... it wasn't polished. It was eaten by rust."
//Is he mixing metaphors now? Same term as the ending lyrics. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It was just half-finished."
//They weren't True Halves. I think it means they hadn't had sex or, at least, hadn't admitted it to each other... not that it matters since, for all we know, Yutaka's attraction to Kiri exists entirely in Taichi's mind. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...?"

For Kiri that is impossible to understand.
Naturally.

[Taichi]
"Aggressiveness in spite of tender-heartedness."
[Taichi]
"That is something I like."
//See Taichi? Whoops. This is part of what he likes underneath the aloofness. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Get it? I like you, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"...Senpai... you? Lies..."
//She can't believe Taichi, the guy she actually likes, would like her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I've been telling just the truth for a while now haven't I."

[Kiri]
"But... this is weird... you have a grudge with Yutaka... so why this for me?"

[Taichi]
"I had no grudge whatsoever."

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"More like, Kiri, you've always treated me like I was some murderer, haven't you."

Her face darkens.

[Kiri]
"...that was... because... there was nothing else I could do..."
//See CCD1001: it's automatic for her. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Nobody would tell me the truth... I could only think about this by myself."
//There is no space for her to ever asked Taichi. Or anyone. He didn't want to hurt her (the fool), so he kept it hidden, plus his stupid repeat of his Alter Ego Pact and this result. -GHS
[Kiri]
"And still... I still can't believe it. That Yutaka would..."

[Taichi]
"It is a bad thing for children's ethical values to include an expectation of omnipotence."
//Not in the children themselves, but for the children to expect this from others. -GHS

So I say, teacher-like.

[Taichi]
"It's gonna be a mess if there's rejection or hatred because of that."
//Like how Youko rejected him the moment he followed her orders... or how Kiri expected Yutaka to be perfect. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

A lengthy hush.
I understand that, inside Kiri, her mental condition is taking emergency measures.
A direction is decided.

[Kiri]
"...what can I do...?"
//Nothing, because SHE can't repay the sins of Yutaka. Not that anybody can. See CCD1001 for a more explicit example of why this route will necessarily end in failure. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeees?"

[Kiri]
"What is the... right thing to do?"

[Taichi]
"Was anything wrong?"

[Kiri]
"But... I, us, we were unjust... to Senpai..."

Us, she says.
She even burdens herself with Yutaka's part of responsibility.

[Taichi]
"You were, yes."

What to do?

[Kiri]
"If I apologize, will you forgive?"

[Taichi]
"I don't have a particular need for apologies, but..."
[Taichi]
"Right, then."
[Taichi]
"...will you do as I say, whatever it is?"

[Kiri]
"..."
//You know, I suddenly get the most horrifying feeling that this... this might be the single most important arc word not just of Cross Channel, but of the entire universe of VNs. I'll elaborate on this tomorrow, as it's work day and it's waaay past midnight, a fact that I'm sure is unrelated. -GHS

Nod. Her head swings downwards.
I place my hands on Kiri's head.
And like that, I slide down and caress her profile, then put fingers in her ears.
//See CCA0007 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ngh..."

Because after all, this is a world of only one day.
//He spoiled iiit -GHS
Let's become frayed until it ends.
There is no need to become anyone, anymore---
//There it is! Becoming means changing, and like just about everyone Taichi hates change. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Seriously?"

[Kiri]
"...if you... give forgiveness."
//See CCC3019B. That's how we know she is serious. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Like to the Genie of the Lamp, I might have three desires that I could ask, you know?"
//And the reason Kiri's hair is so blue-ish is, therefore, because it's reference to Aladdin. But unfortunately, Tanaka couldn't get Robin Williams to play her part. And something precious was lost forever. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...yes."
[Kiri]
"If it's... something I can do."

She got all weak-kneed dinn'she.

[Taichi]
"I am a fetishist, therefore could I even firmly demand you to hand over your 『CHUUKO * USED』 uniform or the like, right Kiri?"
//It's Jagranese anyway(tm). -GHS

[Kiri]
"...y... yes... as you like."

Woooh.
Cuuute.

[Taichi]
"And even the underwear your are using, with a picture proving it's actually been worn o-f-c-o-u-r-s-e."
//See CCC0003A, CCC3019B again. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...if that's the sort of thing... you want..."

She's tearing up. But,

[Kiri]
"...I... understand..."

...the explosive birth of a love slave.
//Wooooh, haven't seen this one in a while. See CCA0006, CCA0007, CCA0019, CCB2005 -GHS
No way, seriously, to have come into that, it's...

[Taichi]
"It's something to live on for."

However, the time remaining is but one day.

[Taichi]
"...crap."

I must hurry.
I impatiently set my sights on the next step.

[Taichi]
"We-, well, maybe I ought to force you to some perverted stuff?"

Kiri shook with a start.

[Kiri]
"...what level... of perverted?"

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm..."
[Taichi]
"Something that would make us into a gut-to-gut, maybe."
//nikunikushii 肉肉しい "meat meatful" = 憎々しい "detestable", see below. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...huh?"

[Taichi]
"Th-, that means there's how you really had a gut feeling that made you hate my guts, I sweeear!"
//ugh the pun -GHS

That was too pushy.

[Kiri]
"Was I... is that like... 'embracing'?"
//Another euphemism for youguessedit. though going by Youko, she might mean "I was enveloped in anger". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Th-, that's pending!"
//Celebrating the 250th recorded example of stuttering (margin of error pending someone on the planet caring). !FEEL THE EXCITEMENT! -GHS

I had decided on embracing (sex),
//Let's avoid turning this into ANOTHER running gag FFS. -GHS
but saying it is difficult.
//He's SO DAMN EVIL he can't even play the role of Dark Nukige Protagonist right, and instead ends up playing that of Damn Moege Protagonist, where he can't spit it out until the actual act, where he's vaguely-OOC aggressive. -GHS

[Taichi]
"First of all, go stand over there."

[Kiri]
"R-, right now?"

There is no time.
Superquickly hyperswiftly filthy sex scene GOOO.
//Curse "breakneckly" for not being a word! Also, as I am in the business of providing the necessary facts for all of you who took the time to read this commentary, here's a page of around 20 puns between clown (piero) and filthy sex (doEro). http://www.logsoku.com/r/news4vip/1285740570/ -GHS
I make her take the teacher's stand.
//It's the wooden elevated platform on which the teacher's desk lies, see BG, but the expression is also literally "to be a teacher". -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, from this onwards I shall be doing sexual things."
//I suppose the budget didn't cover for Kiri to cosplay as a teacher. I'd boo, but then we'd see *shudder* vertical stripes teacher uniform (somehow). That image will haunt me at night... -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!"

Kiri is speechless,
and red to the ears in embarrassment.
Seeming uneasy, as if wondering what shameless infamy she will be forced to experience hereafter.
I was also uneasy.
A human, one, giving me permission to do what I want with her, is something that puts me in quite the pressure.
I'm entering weak-kneed mode.
The cocksure mode I had a short while ago is something I can only hold for a short time!
//There we go, some honesty at last. he's definitely, certainly, absolutely serious. See CCC3004, too, but this continues what Miki says: Taichi has a Perverted and a Nice Guy mode. Nothing more... -GHS

[Taichi]
"W-, well then, Kiri."

My Brutespeech is also clumsy.

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm... OK, first it's Confession Time."

[Kiri]
"Confession?"

[Taichi]
"All the questions I ask from here on you will answer clearly, got it?"
//See CCC3022. He's just doing the same thing! -GHS

[Kiri]
"Y-, yes."

[Taichi]
"Theeen... when'd you have your menarche?"
//Told ya. Console (after embarassed silence): "when did your primary characteristics develop?" Supposing it parallels Yusa there. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...at th-, at thirteen."
//(FWIW: she answers 11 to 13.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

Conversation ain't proceeding...
If there's no further exaggerated astonishment and embarrassment this will be bad!
//See CCC3002. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Having your things at 13! That's so precocious innit!"

[Kiri]
"...eh... it-, it is?"

[Taichi]
"Your salacious D-cup body is so... wait, is-, is it true, no? 13's early, no?"

Weak-kneed me.
//Also girly, no. See CCX0001, no. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I do not know... it is not really something to discuss with other people, so..."
//That would mean she doesn't talk about this with Miki. Now this is really odd... -GHS
[Kiri]
"And... I'm not a D-cup either..."
//Though he's correct to wonder: after all, in animesque design, any girl who shows any sign of having breasts at all while clothed is at least a D cup. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hm-hmmm."

Let's change the question.

[Taichi]
"When was the first time you went and held a man in your mouth, hm?"
//Console: "where do you begin to wash yourself when you're in the tub?" -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ma-, maybe... soon."
//"From the belly". !EXCITING! -GHS

Indeed so it is.
Other things that could embarrass a girl...
//Five minutes ago: "ku ku ku imma totally break you!" Now: "HOW DO I EMBARAS GURL" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right, self-consolation! How's your 'self-consolation'! How many times a week?"
//It's a running gag <- the universal excuse -GHS

[Kiri]
"Self-con... what is that?"
//See, it works better if it's like that! I'm not doing it on purpose (<- lies) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Are you even acquainted with the flavor of the rear side, eh, you Miss Self-Plejah--- wait, eh, what'd you just say?"
//I know this makes it seem like she licks her fingers after anal masturbation, but... I just have the horrible feeling that's exactly what it means. Though it might just mean "the taste of the dark side". -GHS

[Kiri]
"What's this 'consolation'?"

I laughed with a noblewoman's hoooh-hoh-hoh laugh.
//Hopefully improving the odds anyone'll recognize how girly Taichi gets... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ojou-sama is a kidder!"

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"...come on... onanism!"

[Kiri]
"O'nanysm?"

[Taichi]
"Totally unaware of it, then."

[Kiri]
"...yes."
//I'm sorry, but adapting "yes" to "no" sounds like crap. -GHS

The Distanced from Gender Issues Character Attribute perhaps?

[Taichi]
"If I say 'pervy things on yourself' do you get it now?"
//Cutesy. Console: "what shampoo do you use?" -GHS

[Kiri]
"It's 'that' thing... is it?"
//Kiri: "Low acidity". -GHS

[Taichi]
"So it seems."
//Taichi: "Same as mine" -GHS

[Kiri]
"I-, I have..."
//Kiri: "I use the same brand for the rinse." -GHS

Niiice. Feels nice.
//Taichi: "ME TOO!!!" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh, how many times a week?"
//Taichi: "...no, wait, I don't wanna hear about this stuff..." -GHS

[Kiri]
"Up to now just twice, in my life..."

[Taichi]
"Six weekly is quite the very zealous thing innit it's as if expecting a nice bonus for acting like a worker who gives up a five-day work week oh perverted frauLicentiouSain (it's inserted into fraulein) that... wait, twice in your LIFE?! You serious?!"
//Of course only six weekly, on the seventh she rests. 6 (Weekly) + 2 (in five day workweek, it's written "2 weekly rest days) = 8. Fraulein again, last seen with Yusa. Console: Taichi: "Uhm, are you having a balanced diet?" -GHS

I shouted.

[Kiri]
"Y-, yes..."
//Kiri: "...when the family was around... recently, I'm not so sure..." - but like in CCC3019A, this means little: her family is almost never home, see CCC3004. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whyyy so few times! You wanna be Miss Chastity or something?!"
//He then gives her vitamin supplements, which I take to also be in the Taichi Bag. Well, no change then; although here, the supplement is only of iron *badum-tish*. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...y-, you can say that, but... it didn't... really didn't feel very good..."
//...and then he tells her how she must eat her vegetables and not just eat retort pouch stuff, and how they must maintain their bodies, and HE asks HER if HE can do something more. Dammit, that's funnier than this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Disappointmeeent!"
//"Literal". Console: "Wait, whyyy did I become all nice now!!!!". He then hugs her (d'awww), calls her adorable, and asks her to get married. -GHS

Unmoe.
This is bad, we're still not getting into the mood.

[Taichi]
"...o-, OK. Next step, let's go to the next step!"

[Kiri]
"Y-, yes."

[Taichi]
"The stylish hoh!-time (pronounced showtime) has ended. Hereafter is principal photography (sex), oh indeed. The shyness in you and the animal passions in me: which of the two is the real deal shall be put to test!"
//Same weirdo term used in the Touko route, and is kept same in the console version. Might's well keep that as a running gag as well. (Told you it explains everything.) -GHS

[Kiri]
"???"

Hum. I understood nothing of what I said either.
Whatever, let's go!

[Taichi]
"SK-, SKIRTO... MAINAS... KIKKU... EKUARU, what?"
//He asks to see the "coloring" (English) of her panties here. Notable because it's the damn question he asks Nanaka instead of anything useful. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...'mainas'? 'Kikku'?"

[Taichi]
"It's about answering the following question for X:"
//OH NOES I DIDN'T STUDY FOR THE TEST plus a dog hate my homework so he ate it. -GHS
[Taichi]
"SKIRT - KICK = X"
//Skirt = x+kick -> futanari*skirt = (x+kick)/futanari -> futanari = (x+kick)/(futanari*skirt) -> x = penis. It's math; it has like equal signs and shit. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh, uhmm... th-, that is a difficult one...."

[Taichi]
"If I were to go flip Kiri's skirt, I would get kicked. Therefore..."
//LOGIC PUZZLES NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOdies -GHS

[Kiri]
"Kicking is... normal...?"

[Taichi]
"I-, is it really normal now?"

[Kiri]
"You want to flip my skirt... right?"
//Here console rejoins. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nope, you'll be flipping it for me, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Yh?"
//Another suspicious 'I'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Show me by yourself. Come on!"

[Kiri]
"By myself you say..."

[Taichi]
"Hurry it up. Got no time!"

Kiri seemed to push down on her skirt in hesitation, but, soon, steadied her resolve.
With the slow movement of the raising of a theater's curtain, she rolled up the skirt.
//At least the vertical stripes are hard to see... sob. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...oooh, pawntys..."
//cutesy -GHS

Joy commensurate to the hardship.

[Kiri]
"I-, is this enough?"

[Taichi]
"The hell you say! We're still but still in the prologue aren't we!"
[Taichi]
"A lengthy itinerary awaits us before the ending! Come now, keep that thing lifted up!"

[Kiri]
"Th-, this is... weird."

[Taichi]
"Nice underwear innit."
//Taichi is an enemy of underwear taste. -GHShimaPantsNeedToBeHorizontalHORIZONTALDAMMIT

[Kiri]
"...thanks."

[Taichi]
"They fit you well. Truly Kirish to wear something that makes youthfulness and tidy properness coexist."
//Line split -GHS
[Taichi]
"They create a refreshing composition at the root that connects these two legs as vital as a young sweetfish, meekly wrapping these gluteals barely tinged with roundness, a figure that bestows a feeling of freshness to others... almost problematically marvelous."
//No clue if this time it's intended to be like the snack or the f--- you know what I'm going whatever with this, while grumbling against Kinoko Nasu: *grumble* *grumble* kinoko nasu *grumble* -GHS

[Kiri]
"...do not give it a critique please..."

[Taichi]
"Well then,"

Next.
Next up after the panchira is something very clear.

[Taichi]
"...I shall download your panties."
//he has a hard drive -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh? Download, what?"

[Taichi]
"I will slip your panties downwards."

[Kiri]
"EEEH?"

[Taichi]
"What'cha shocked for?"

[Kiri]
"All the way to that..."

[Taichi]
"Slip, yeah. I will slide. I'd love to do this waaay mooore slowly, but, we got no time."
//Also "fog up in frost", among several other vaguely-related puneanings throughout the sentence. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Time you say... you said that before, what is it about?"

[Taichi]
"Just a thing of mine. More importantly, you will, before this day is over, become my love doll."
//See Taichi doll. Oh, and Taichi as living doll. I highlight the obvious to meet your levels of intellectuality(tm). -GHS

[Kiri]
"Lo-, love doll..."

[Taichi]
"Keep your hands like that now."

I hang my fingers on the ends of Kiri's underwear.

[Taichi]
"Save target as..."
//This is, unsurprisingly, precisely what IE calls it - all the way to the latest versions as of writing. -GHS

Slowly and steadily slipping downwards,
//damn dialup like an hour to download the Darklight Conflict demo to discover it's not the sequel to Cybermage: Darklight Awakening dammit -GHS
precisely like wages and interest rates.
//I think at this point even Tanaka was going mad with boredom at the sex scenes. -GHS
The underwear trends downward, smoothly sliding down the ass.

[Kiri]
"N-, nooo... you'll see it..."

[Taichi]
"See What?"

[Kiri]
"T-, the secret place..."
//I'll never get why girls think this 野老 is so precious -GHS

We were getting on,
but the nethers were not exposed yet.
The side string on one side just barely rests on the hipbone.
//Damn, any slower and it'll be the contraption that lowers people into acid from an Adam West Batman episode... -GHS
The very center is closely glued to the nethers, clinging hard to them.
It's just barely wedged into the vulva, putting the shape into relief.
I lower the fingers one centimeter.
Yank, and the fabric is drawn below.
//May be just in his humble opinion, though. -GHS
With the sensation of being stripped getting stronger, Kiri stiffens tightly throughout her body.

[Taichi]
"...I think I'll forgive you everything with this."
//Even this isn't him being straightforwards and manipulative: he DID say he doesn't see it as anything to be forgiven. Of course he's lying... but at least as much to himself as to her. -GHS

I can feel a sense of relief coming from Kiri.
That instant,
I yank my fingers all the way to the ankles in one stroke.

[Kiri]
"KYAAH?!"

It's in vieeeew!!!

[Taichi]
"Hoooh hoh hoh, is that not the third planet of the Solar System, Mons Venus..."
//Sun was spelled right, oddly enough. The word he uses seems to explicitly exclude the sun. According to one of the many pages that somehow exist on the Internet: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_venus_the_third_planet_from_the_sun I am going with one of the great many intentional mishaps of knowledge Taichi is known for. Pun is with Veneris Mons, you eternal virgins. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so-, so embarrassing... ngh, sob..."

She's crying?
What a brittle thing.

[Taichi]
"Well, Kiri, your hair is quite sparse."

[Kiri]
"That's... please don't talk about that..."

[Taichi]
"But it's not really curly, it all flows straight down... it's beautiful. It's just like it's been combed."

[Kiri]
"Ngggh..."

[Taichi]
"Besides, this Mons Veneris is all soft and fluffy like a pancake... it's like it's unconsciously defending its peace!"
//The hair. -GHS

I study Kiri's nethermosts staring, fixedly, at point-blank range.

[Kiri]
"...ngh... reallyyy..."

I blew breath on them.

[Kiri]
"NGH!, breath, don't, don't, please!"

Femurs shaking.
I narrow my mouth so that the needle of breath adds further stimulus to Kiri's slot.
//coinopか. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Nnh... that's... weird... odd... odd...!"

Perhaps tickled, the lower half of the body fidget and shakes.

[Taichi]
"But Kiri, your down-theres haven't grown up at all, they still look like a child's don't they."
//Just like much of her uptheres... -GHS

Whoosh, and the amount of red in the face increases.

[Kiri]
"Wh-, what does that... mean?"

[Taichi]
"It closes so tight, feels just like a baby girl's. The flappy part is just barely even visible..."

[Kiri]
"It-, it's not normal... then?"
//She's got a Normalcy Complex even bigger than Taichi's... -GHS

[Taichi]
"They should have much more of a rafflesian shape. *Puff!*"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia ew -GHS

[Kiri]
"KyAhnh!"

Wah, way too cute. I'm in love.
Dammit, now I just want it.

[Taichi]
"...your virginity, Kiri, may I have it?"

[Kiri]
"!"

She's momentarily at a loss for words. But then, stout-heartedly,

[Kiri]
"I knew... that it would end like this."
[Kiri]
"Showing you my embarrassing spot... and being embraced... if that... makes you give your forgiveness..."
//...clear yet that this is just a slight variant on the toilet scene? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...not really, I..."

To forgive, to not forgive...
But,
however it goes,
Yutaka, to me he's---
The question was made to precipitate forcibly.
//Same as at the start above. He's still jealous of Yutaka... or more likely, see CCC3004 again: he's afraid Yutaka will do to Kiri what he did himself, and wants to break it off. The error is that Yutaka would have very likely never have done anything to Kiri; Taichi only thinks this because he hasn't forgiven the guy. He's making the exact same error with Yutaka that Kiri has made with Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Just lower it already."
//No double meaning (that's as clear as it is in English). -GHS

Kiri lets her skirt fall off.

[Taichi]
"Raise your feet."

She raises her feet one after the other, and I remove her panties.
Scrunching them up into a handful, I apply them to the tip of the nose.

[Kiri]
"No-, NOOO!"

[Taichi]
"Mmmh, nice smell."

[Kiri]
"Stop it, I beg you stop!"

[Taichi]
"...fine, fine."
[Taichi]
"But these I'll be keeping! Because they've been downloaded."

I save them in the right pocket.

[Taichi]
"And also, we'll be doing something far more embarrassing, OK?"

[Kiri]
"......ah, uhm... in here?"
//Still suspecting the sex scenes do not actually happen at all, but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mh-hm."

[Kiri]
"But I want to... take a bath before that..."

[Taichi]
"Not happening."

That's the most delicious part dammit.
//Oh, there goes Touko again. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Go to the window."

[Kiri]
"Y-, yes..."

She stands by the window.

[Taichi]
"...right now, you are not wearing any panties, are you Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"Because you... took them off..."

She averts the sight.

[Taichi]
"From here onwards, you will always be together with me, Kiri-chin. Right?"

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"You'll be staying at my house from tonight."

[Kiri]
"I... understand."

[Taichi]
"Also, you cannot be wearing panties from now on."
//See CCC3025. Repeat 'em patterns. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...cannot... then, what will I do?"

[Taichi]
"You'll always go no-pan of course."
//Sakuraba ate it all anyway. -GHS

So I proclaim as if it was a matter of course.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin's right to bear panties has been suspended."
//Not a typo... maybe. She's old for bear panties too. BUT THEY'D BE AN IMPROVEMENT ON THESE. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Se-, seriously, but what if somebody sees me!"

[Taichi]
"...will your heart go all boom, boom?"

[Kiri]
"It will NOT!"

[Taichi]
"It will and definitely, I think."
//Trying to give her an exhibitionist streak. -GHS

[Kiri]
"It will not, nothing of the sort, it just can not!"

I kill a laugh in my teeth.
//See Misato route. -GHS
Unsteadfastness is so lovely.

[Taichi]
"Well then now."

I insert my fingers inside of her skirt,
and put a finger on the chasm.

[Taichi]
"...yes. Seems like there's a little bit of hot air coming in from this fissure."
[Taichi]
"I'll widen it."
//...is he trying to escape from a cave-in now? -GHS

Very slowly and gently I slide while pushing the finger in.
Spltch, and the meat split.

[Kiri]
"...nh!"

Kiri ends up standing on her tiptoes.
Her waist rises up as if to escape.
But it won't escape.
//See CCC3022, among others -GHS
I make the finger sink into the flesh.

[Kiri]
"...ah, scary, it's scary!"

She clings to my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"It's all right."

[Kiri]
"It'll hurt, feels like it'll hurt..."

[Taichi]
"It's fine, believe me."

Finger stimulus is too strong, then.
I pull out.
On the way out, I graze the clitoris with the thick of the finger.

[Kiri]
"KyaUhhh!"

She's sensitive.

[Taichi]
"Well, I'll be doing this in a much gentler way then."

[Kiri]
"...eh... eh, what?"

I dive my head inside Kiri's skirt.

[Kiri]
"Ah, AAAH... you're kidding me..."

I stick out the tongue, with plenty of saliva laid on top.

[Kiri]
"fWaaaah?!"

I shove into the flesh.
~Deep kiss~
The tip of the tongue tucks into a hot space.
What body temperature!
//Like Touko. Who'd have thought tsunderes were cold on the outside but on the inside they--- ohhh. -GHS
Spreading out Kiri's legs, I move the head.
//Mof, mof -GHS
With a tongue made into a cutter, I insert myself into Kiri's rift.
//...see CCA0007? -GHS
There it was, the undiluted smell of a girl's sex.

[Kiri]
"...ngUuuuh..."

Moaning.
This is definitely the first time she's felt cunnilingus.
The tip of my tongue politely opens Kiri's folds.
I make it into a woman's sexual organ using my mouth.
//Because it didn't look like one before, I guess. -GHS

[Kiri]
"hYAh, hYaah... ah, aaah, ngh!"

A thin voice from high overhead.

[Kiri]
"Ah, do-, don't suck, no, sucking noooo!"

[Taichi]
"You're saying that sucking makes you go all aflutter, are you."

[Kiri]
"Th-, that's not... true..."

Untrue that it's not true.
//coconut = coconut THE END -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'll just peel it off."

Kiss resumption.

[Kiri]
"fKKuuuh, ahuh, aaah... hah, hah, inside so deep... kCHaah... nnnh!"

My head is pressed down.
It isn't to get me to stop.
Lick with plenty of spit.
//nero nero to nameru. So much troll. -GHS
A motion as if to brew stew, stirring in a circle.
I thoroughly wash the interior wall with spin after spin.
//Wash + investigate. Nice. -GHS
Perhaps she'd cleaned it, as there is almost no lingering scent of the menstrual discharge.
//She did that before Taichi started licking, of course. Just keep telling yourself that. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hah, hahnh, nnnh."

At times, I pass with a slimy spltch as far back as I can.
//Seriously stop it -GHS

[Kiri]
"NgggUhhhhhh...!"

Her answer is so innocent.
I'll try to suck the urethra.

[Kiri]
"Kyah?! Kyah, no way, you can't, you cannot!"

Panic.

[Kiri]
"Out, it comes out from there...! L-, leave it I beg... it's dirty..."

Interrupted.
As I am a filthy pervert, I don't think it dirty, but,
//~urolasagna~ -GHS
well... let's leave that as a pleasure to be enjoyed later.
Above the urethra,
I discover a bean.
//But humans don't have beans! Damn Taichi and his unscientific trolls, next he'll tell us that women exist. -GHS
I suck.
//~~~ -GHS

[Kiri]
"???!!!"

Kiri should know what is buried way down there, but does she?

[Kiri]
"A-, ah-, AH-...?"

Lick.
Making the tip narrow, I licked in circles.

[Kiri]
"KyAh, kyah, hah, ah, hahn, wh-, whaaat?"

[Taichi]
"...it's the clitoris! Jesus. LkLkLkLkLk!"
//Even here... -GHS

Tapping.
//He's trying to FC TTFatF on Expert. *checks temperature* yes I do have a fever as I write this, thank you. -GHS

[Kiri]
"hYAh... anh! AAAAAAAAH!"
//ーx8 (still keeping track of these are you?) -GHS

Hips run away.
I hug her butt with both arms.
I said no escape!
I accelerated the attack.

[Kiri]
"...aHyah, nhyahAaAAah!"

Her waist trembles and vibrates,
and yet,

[Taichi]
"You weak to being moistened then?'

Maybe because it's her first time.

[Kiri]
"Hah, hah..."

However, she seems to feel it.
I test with a finger insertion.

[Kiri]
"...!, ow..."

Does it hurt?
I release her body at once.
I come out from the skirt. Kiri sighs with relief.
Hoh, might it be a question of mood I wonder.
//girly -GHS

[Taichi]
"...how about we go to the infirmary, is that fine?"
//Formal -GHS

[Kiri]
"That would be... better..."

If we don't do things properly it seems it's not gonna happen.

[Taichi]
"Before that, I forgot this."

[Kiri]
"Eh... NNNH?"
//Console: KISSKISSKISSKISSKISS--- (In Western letters.) -GHS

I gave her a real-deal kiss.
//He just went vagina-to-mouth. Just pointing out she doesn't seem to be all that flustered with it ~lesbians~ -GHS

[Taichi]
"?"

The tactile sensation is wrong.
It was heterogeneous.
//Not an arc word this one I suspect. -GHSarc
I thought I could just get away with a light kiss, but...
I try inserting the tongue.

[Kiri]
"NNNNNNNH!"
//...and still it sevens -GHS

Clenching her teeth, she shakes her head right and left.
I grasp her lower jaw with one hand, fast.

[Taichi]
"Nope, open up."

[Kiri]
"...f-, feels icky..."

[Taichi]
"You say things that wound me."
//To her defense, he DID just suck on her urethra... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Open up."

So I proclaim as if chewing on her.

[Kiri]
"..."

The amenable gated doors of the dentition open.
//??? -GHS
The tongue is coming to visit.
//???????? -GHS
Ugh, it was like mud.
It's saliva,
in large quantity,
as well as high viscosity.

[Kiri]
"nFhuh, nnh... ahfhuh!"

Soggily I stir.
Soft lips. Soft tongue.
I twine, squish and flatten.

[Kiri]
"hFhuh, hfuh, nnh, nfhuh... nnnh!"

I make her eyes go monochrome in surprised fluster.
//Left the literal in because eyes. -GHS
First and also deep innit.
I suck on the tongue.

[Kiri]
"NNNNNNNH?!"
//7x -GHS

Reflexively, my hands tighten on her shoulders.
Her tongue was viscous like mucilage.
It's melted jelly, covered by a thin membrane.
It feels like it would crack if I dug into it with the teeth.
I try some sweet chewing.

[Kiri]
"nFhwuh, nhoh, nmHmH, nh, nhh, NHHHHH!"

Waddle, and the hips fell.
Promptly I insert a hand in the nethers to support.
It's in the direction just opposite the Fishing with a Pole technique,
a Power Art where one approaches from the back, then inserts the hand in the nethers and pulls up.
//See CCC0016B -GHS
Doing that to a girl is the height of fun.
//"Also, I'd rather write about this than a sex scene". -GHS
And then, it's certain it'll end with a suspension.
//At least we get a good hint about what it was that he did to Miss Machiko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"C'mon c'mon, what's going on here?"

[Kiri]
"...fhwah... aHfhuh... ah..."

Whaaat?
I gather awareness in the supporting hand.
...it was damp.
//Vulnerable to tongue. Hey, just like Touko! I wonder if that has anything to do with this beyond their both being tsundere... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...?"

Even if it wasn't really wet just moments ago.
As I think on this, I try a kiss a second time.
PchuhChuhJhrhUjrhShckLichShckLichShckLich!
//A random reminder that many (if not most) of the explicit moods set in the story are trolls. -GHS

[Kiri]
"NNNH, nh, ahfhuh, nnn〜, pch, nnh, nh, hah, ahaaah..."

Seriously, this saliva is viscously sticky.
Just like lotion.
Bite, bite on that upper lip.

[Kiri]
"Ah, hfuh, HYAaah..."

Teary eyes.
And from that I can say,
that she is feeling this.
Her face said that her sexual desires had been warmed.

[Kiri]
"Ahfuh, hah, ahnh..."

Bite, bite on that upper lip while I think,
could she be weak to kissing?
I insert my tongue in her oral cavity.
I make it into a funnel shape, and pour saliva in.

[Kiri]
"Nh? NNNNNH?!"

[Taichi]
"Drink."

I gag her via hand.
Kiri shakes her head left and right.
She seems to dislike this.

[Taichi]
"Not happening. Drink."
//Love how nukige characters can talk normally when their mouths are full. -GHS

Resigned, perhaps, she jutted out the jaw,
and gulps down what is in her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Round 2 next!♪"

[Kiri]
"NNNNNN〜!!!"
//No, they're not always seven. Or are they? Counting the ~ as one... and it's 8 characters excluding the exclamation marks. Only in CC that's not obvious fanwanking. -GHS

I, too, had plenty of bodily fluids.

[Taichi]
"Come, drink."

Deglutition.

[Taichi]
"Round three〜."

[Kiri]
"Stop, please... this is... perverted... nPh, nh, pchrh... owww..."

Most certainly it is.

[Kiri]
"Nh... nKh, gulp..."

I distance from her lips.
Kiri drew a looong sigh of relief.
//319 actual lines to go ;______; -GHSigh

[Kiri]
"...not tasty... at all."

[Taichi]
"'Course."

[Kiri]
"Uhm... about going to the infirmary..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, in the end I've abandoned that. Instead, there's something I want you to do."
//See CCB2012. It's another Touko rerun. Considering how many of those are reruns of his Hasekura backstory and his rape at the hands of Youko, this is a point. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Something you want?"

I expose my nethers.
JMP N_SCENE002

[Taichi]
"Suck it."

[Kiri]
"............what?"

[Taichi]
"Suck it."

[Kiri]
"O-, on that... you say? But that's... that thing is..."

[Taichi]
"Indeed it is. Amongst Arabs it is a symbol of manhood called Pehanis, in the Pharrus Creed it is both object of worship and idolization: it is an accursed organ that signifies and indicates maleness itself."
//"Titiim" Does not seem to be an Arab word for dick. And I googled that and all. Sigh. Supposing it's just a play on 'chinchin', so going with that. Same with phallus/Pharos (going with something more pharric). Suspecting 呪的器官 is a spoof of some real term, but I can't find much. -GHS

These are lies.
//The problems begin when he starts talking that exact kind of crap as if he seriously believed it was true... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Buuut that's that's a man's That and it's It because this is a This and... g'buh?!"
//This is this; that is that; and it's all a penis. And that concludes my lesson on Japanese. -GHS

I ram it in forcibly.

[Taichi]
"It's alright. You won't hurt it."

[Kiri]
"NNNNNH?!"

She attempts to spit it out.

[Taichi]
"...won't you heal me?"
//Exploitative, see CCC3012A, CCC3004... but what is his demon but his dick? -GHS

Motions stopped.

[Taichi]
"I'm a horrible guy, therefore, I do horrible things. Veeery much so."
[Taichi]
"But... because I don't want you to feel in pain, I do it like this."

This is truth.
//Contrasts above in more ways than one: the pseudocredible crap he often spits out as truth, while these blatant lies to get her to service him sexually are far more likely to not be what he believes. Except, of course, since Tanaka's a true bastard, those about the Pharrus were actually lies, while he in truth doesn't want Kiri to feel bad. Truth and lies are and remain a complex thing here, even in sex scenes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...c'mon, please!"

[Kiri]
"...ngggh."

Resigned, maybe,
Kiri stopped moving.

[Taichi]
"Uhm, no biting, OK. And..."

Just the trunk of the lecture.
//Ugh, the puns... -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, gonna do it?"

[Kiri]
"Nnnh... nh, nmh... nnnh."

Slowly, Kiri began a slow rhythmic motion.
Her head slides back and forth.
Not knowing male physiology that well, the motion was unsatisfyingly slow.
But it feels good, and that's good.
//Good things are good. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Nh, nmh, pchrh... nmh... aHfhuh, jHurhrh, pch... nh, hahfuh, nnnnh!"

Tongue entangles.
I can feel the weight of the saliva following around the pole.
Truly, that thing was lotion.
Nice and slippery.

[Kiri]
"Nmh, nnnh...nfhuh, fhah, hfh, nnnh...... pch, pch... hrohrheh..."

I am sucked,
exactly as I instructed.
Clumsily, but obediently,
by Sakura Kiri.
Despite how I all but stole a precious member of your family.
Despite how my relationship with Yutaka had originally nothing to do with Kiri.
//One can joke about Silent Hill, but the situation here is nearly exactly inversed: the Taichi as seen from Kiri (fog) is the dark one, while the one seen from outside seems a lot less evil. Both are still not quite the true thing. -GHS
You beseeched me with forgiveness with so much burden on your shoulders.
...sorry!
A lion on the hunt could perhaps maybe even want to lay down with the rabbit, I don't know.
//At least he switches from lupine to feline at times. This is Isaiah 11:6, and important because it speaks of the reign of Jesus - which is what Taichi is calling when he wishes for the sky to go away. -GHS
After eating it, he could feel regret, I don't know.
But if something moves fast in front of his eyes, he'll attack without fail.
//But Taichi likes the immutable from a distance... -GHS
Because it's an instinct.

[Kiri]
"Nchuh, hrhroh... nh, nhhhnhnh..."

[Taichi]
"Like that, rhythmically, until your jaw is tired..."

[Kiri]
"...nh, nHnHnHnHnHnHnHnH... phwah, nnnh, nHnHnH... nnnh〜"
//x8 -GHS

At times, while she twists her neck a little,

[Kiri]
"nHnHnHnHnH"
//x7 -GHS

the slippery wet inside of her mouth goes around and around.
//See CCA0015C, again -GHS

[Taichi]
"...feels good, yes, Kiri."

Slimy membranes.
I want to swing and sway inside them for all time.
I pull out all at once,
That thickness of the saliva lingered and formed strings.
//Now see Yusa. -GHS
I pressed into a cheek.
//From the outside -GHS

[Kiri]
"...hah, ah, haaah..."

No refusal.
She accepts in silence the change in the cheek's shape caused by the meatpole.
//What's with the nukige terminology? He asked, knowing the answer very well -GHSoliloquy

[Taichi]
"Tired?"

[Kiri]
"...no."

[Taichi]
"Then, say 'aaah'"

Mouth opens. Obediently.
Penis insertion.
70% is about the limit. Any more and it'll be burdensome.
//There we go again. 七分 is a type of pantaloons, too. (Pantaloons, as the word avenues, are pants worn by loons. No, I'm not wearing any; I translate without pants.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"While you suck, move like you were doing before."

I gently stroke her head.
Kiri moved.

[Kiri]
"aHuhhh..."

Sliding, back and forth,
and on top of that, the nasal breathing gently strokes the top of the pole.
Arousal and pleasure both swell.
And that it is Kiri making them do this makes it a huge swell.
//His d-- the above. -GHS
That very Kiri.
I wanted to make Kiri drink.

[Taichi]
"...I might be coming this once. Mind if I come?"
[Taichi]
"Can I release in your mouth, Kiri?"
//On continuing to reread this stuff, I begin to wonder if Taichi simply doesn't feel much pleasure from orgasming at all. Psychological frigidity doesn't seem so unlikely for someone like him. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...uhh..."

Her mouth still full, Kiri gives a sharp nod.
But she is seriously likely not even able to comprehend the meaning of that 'release'.

[Taichi]
"Then, releasing!"

I shake the hips, twitching.
The tip rubs in the coarse flesh of the inside of her mouth.
Maybe it's because of the thickness of the saliva,
but over her mucous membranes there's something like a coat of sap, five millimeters thick.
//The ミ　mi in milliliters is written sort of like the number 3 三, and read the same, so 8. If katakana Ha is eight... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Nh, nnh... nnnnh, nhmuh, hrhuh, nKh, hfah... NOoo."

I nearly take the pole outside entirely, and apply it to her like lipstick.
//WTF -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, really, nooo..."

I pushed inside.

[Kiri]
"N'buh..."

[Taichi]
"C'mon, suck!"

[Kiri]
"hFah... nh, nnh, hAhmh... pch, hrhuh... pchhh〜"

She'd come quite far by now.
I move slower to make sucking easier.
Excellent adhesion in the inside of the mouth.
And then, semen.
//...you guys are no fun. -GHS

[Kiri]
"nBuh... nh, nkh... nnnh... nGh, gLp... glP..."

She's drinking.
Did she think she would've been made to drink regardless?
There is no difference in viscosity between my semen and Kiri's saliva,
perhaps resistance was just very light.

[Kiri]
"...nKhKh... gulp..."

She drank all, to the last.
IF $KAISOU == 0 JMP N_SCENE102

[Taichi]
"...you drank dinn'cha."
//This transition is brief enough that there's no need for further guerrilla hacks. -GHS

[Kiri]
"fHahyh..."

Agreement with the mouth full.

[Taichi]
"So nice!"

I stroke her head.
Kiri closed her eyes, showing no emotion.
Kiri's mouth is... a sexual organ itself.
//Like Misato's! No, wait, I mean, of course, Youko. And Touko's too. He's just masturbating, isn't he. -GHS
But this is something I won't say to her.
I pull out.
Stickily syrupily wetted.
//More implied, but the Touko connections yet continue. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This should be alright I think."

I lead her hands to the window.
JMP N_SCENE003

[Kiri]
"I-, in this position...?"
//In case some haven't noticed that a third(ish)-floor window at Suicide High is EASILY OPENABLE. Trolly troll trollity troll. Unfortunately, it's hard to see much of the outside or whatever step outside of the window where her crossbow would've been put. Oh well. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yep."

I was pushing against her tiny little privates.

[Kiri]
"No... it is... scary."

[Taichi]
"Yep."

It would be so, I think.
I try using a light touch.
Preparations were complete:
thinly open, full of heat, and loose.
...dripping wet.

[Kiri]
"Slow... slow, slowly... I beg you..."

She supplicates as if her very life were at stake.
But no matter what she says to me,

[Taichi]
"Yep."

is the only thing I can respond with.
//See CCD2002. More Touko references. -GHS
I flow inside.

[Kiri]
"AH... ah, aah..."

At a constant speed.

[Kiri]
"NOO--!"

I broke on through,
to the other side.
//You know the day destroys the night, night divides the day. Hey, it totally fits! -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ah... it's inside... it's... inside..."

Kiri's saliva and sex fluids took away all resistance to passage,
to the point where she has no complaints about pain.

[Taichi]
"It doesn't hurt, that's good."

[Kiri]
"Hah, ah, hah..."

Nevertheless, Kiri fell limp from the shock.
I begin a back and forth motion at slow speed.
I could feel the massively thick slime.
There is no air in the vagina, so it feels as if I'm being sucked inside.

[Kiri]
"Yhuh... hah, ha, ah... ah, ah... oh."

A sense of unraveling as I trace in every direction.

[Kiri]
"Auhhh... yYy, uh.... auh!"

I try touching the very depth.
Shallow.
It's not perfect satisfaction all the way to the end,
but I was able to subjugate all of Kiri.
//He is not, of course, talking about his dick in her shallow pussy. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...getting used to this a bit?"

[Kiri]
"I don't... know... hah... hah!"

[Taichi]
"Should I just give it a bit more kneading?"

[Kiri]
"Eh? ...aUUh! ...oh... hAhnh!"

Kiri's hole is narrow and hot,
and I grow engrossed as I come in contact with it.
//Same term used to describe Yutaka's behavior in the mansion after a while. Parallels are definitely intended here. -GHS
It's just the combination of organs that are no more than irregular biological shapes, repeated a countless number of times.
//This would perhaps require font fuckery to properly return. I decided against large-form ASCII art out of the magnanimity of my generous heart. -GHS
Little children do the same with toy blocks and their /\/\ and \/\/ shapes.
//If the damn engine still displayed kanjis I'd just use the kanjis for concave and convex, 凹 and 凸, just like Tanaka used in the line above. It's not like the kanji pun is any...... deeper! (fnarr, fnarr). Also, little children playing with blocks are actually having loli/shota sex. Seriously, what the hell? -GHS

[Kiri]
"nAh... ah, Aah... aHahnh! Ah... nAh, aAh... nh, a-... uh, nh..."
[Kiri]
"Ah, hah, nh... hAhNh... nh... ah, AH, Aah, Ah... nh, nh, nh, aAh!"
//Going with a bit more adaptation on this: none. -GHS

Gradually, the quality of her voice dampens and muddies.
It hangs around the nose, somewhat huskily.
She's rapidly boring the act of penetration into habit.
//貫 pierce -> 慣 get used to. This is just cringeworthy, but at least it alleviates the boredom. Ha ha I made it a triple pun. -GHS
She arranges and orders the rhythm of the air expelled from the lungs, too.
I want to break down this reordered Kiri, so I stab very deeply.

[Kiri]
"KYaUh!"

Throat bends.
I reached in to the end. But I push in even more.

[Kiri]
"...aHaHah..."

Hip glues to hip.

[Kiri]
"H-, harsh... not that... strong, please..."

Remaining driven in deep, I sway left and right as if to draw letters.
//OK, OK, this is too silly! Too silly! -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, hFah... aHn... ah, no, not... no-, noo, not!"

Kiri returns to infancy.
//Lolicon is a fog. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Th-, not thaaat, hFuh, too deep! nnh, ah."

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

I lick around her ear from the back, urging her on.
Tiny lips turn the way of mine,
they seek, and link.

[Kiri]
"Nh... nhm... hruh, hrhuh, hAhnh, nMhuh..."

A plump, fat tongue.
A jellylike thing that I lead inside my mouth and play with.

[Kiri]
"Nhfh, nnnh〜."

Kiri coos, breathing out of her nose.
My brain scorches, my lowermosts heat up.

[Kiri]
"Ah, ah, aaah, nh, aHn, auuuu〜h!"
[Kiri]
"Fa-, fast... Senpai, too fast... AHHH!"

Leaning onto the windowsill, Kiri emits shameless screams.
//There's no way they can't hear her two floors above in what should be a world with absolutely no one else! -GHS
I pierce her with enough for to push her outwards.
And the upper body became exposed to the outside with a sliding motion.
//Again, might just be 'is 'umble opinion. (randomly British) -GHS
Kiri clings to the window post, emitting a voice of yet different loveliness.

[Kiri]
"I-, I'll fall, fall... kYAH, Senpai, fall... AAAAAH?!"
//Very rape nukige, this. How do I know, you ask? ...people don't learn Japanese with rape nukige? Huh? Don't be absurd now. It's not like he's still having her imitate Yutaka, who fell down the roof. -GHS

Her vagina seemed ready to burst open with a pop.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, you tightened up!"

Her insides were constricting.
Terror makes the whole body shrink down.
Intoxicated, I poke even more.

[Kiri]
"Ah, kyah, kayh... scary! ...scary, scary... STOOOP!"

[Taichi]
"If you hold tight you won't fall."
//To the pillars. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hold... tight?"

With disgust on her face.

[Taichi]
"He - re."

I draw a figure-8.
//Yu. 8=8 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ghuuuh, hYkh, KYAH!!!"

[Taichi]
"C'mon, put strength in that ass."
//The amazing writing of Romeo Tanaka. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hah, haw, hawww!"

[Taichi]
"Yep yep."

I stop moving, and taste of the skin that seems to penetrate through the gaps of her half-stripped uniform.
//Hum, nothing to do with CCC3022 then? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ahahh... hYhk, h, nh..."

Perhaps relieved,
her vagina relaxes gently.
Therefore, I push in again, hips and all.

[Kiri]
"kYAAAH!"

And Kiri holds to the pillar fast.
And her interior, too, clings fast.
//Wait, so the above wasn't a pun??? -GHS
A sense of pressure that makes me feel as if crushed.
Gaplessness has a peculiar feeling, and it's so comfortable.

[Kiri]
"Ahguh, I'll faaall, I will faaall... nKh!"

[Taichi]
"Well then, hold even tighter."

[Kiri]
"I-, impossible... strength... failing... kYahUh!"

Her expression had already loosened, and I couldn't associate it with neither pleasure nor despondency.
The slackening was paralyzing her whole body.
No avoiding this,
I thrust fingers inside Kiri's mouth.

[Kiri]
"aFhuh, ah, hruh, hroh, nFuh!"

The fingertips become enveloped in sticky viscous fluid,
enough that they seem to be holding a puppet's strings.
//Is she a doll or a marionette now?????? MAKE UP YOUR MIND AGGGGH INSANE RAGE DUE TO IRRELEVANT DETAIL CREATED BY READING LATERALLY WHAT IS MEANT TO BE READ LITERALLY or was it viceversa. See CCD0022A. -GHS
And those slimy fingertips I thrust into Kiri's other narrow spot.
//#yaoi #ass -GHS

[Kiri]
"hYah... wh-, what are-?

Pushing with rotation, I insert without difficulty.

[Kiri]
"FhNgh?!"
//Fukku? "fuck"? -GHS

There was a dramatical effect.
//Obviously another reference to DRAMAtical Murder, because ass. Also see CCA0017B meaning glasses + ass = tsukihime although Curry has nothing to do with anythARE WE THERE YEEEET -GHS

[Taichi]
"...whoa, 'mazing!"

The vaginal interior, already pretty tight, narrows even further.

[Taichi]
"There, now you're properly held in two spots, and you won't fall."
//He means 3? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...you caaan't... you can't, back there, back theeere! Aaah!"

Tiny buttocks.
I push in to the root of the thumb.
//He apparently only inserted the thumb, but the above says fingers. This is a most grave matter that will be subjected to damn I don't care enough to get to the end of that thought. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ahhh... NOOoo... take it out nooow, out..."

Movement.
Once more Kiri juts to outside.

[Kiri]
"Ngh... uh, Ahuh... AaAaaah, hahn, worse, than before, haFh!"

That's because Kiri's entire body is tightening.

[Kiri]
"Ah, aah, aAah! Aaahnh, hahaahnh... hahnh, fAhnh, ah, l-, let me go already... hYah..."

Stop.

[Kiri]
"Haaah, haaah, hahhh..."

I am wrung rhythmically by the vaginal opening.
I wipe off the sweat on her nape with the tongue, while I whisper:

[Taichi]
"...your contractions are so easy to read, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Nooo... I do not care, about that... nh..."
//Half-formalzzzzzz -GHS

Drool drips from her lips.

[Taichi]
"..."

I draw the mouth in, and suck on it.
I gladly quaff the saliva in Kiri's stead.

[Kiri]
"Ahmuh, nh, nnnh, pchruh, hrh... nnnnh... nh... eUh..."

I make her clean down to the tip of her chin.

[Kiri]
"Ahn... Senpai..."

She closes her eyes, and accepts,
that by now she is My Kiri.

[Taichi]
"You're hot inside your butt too!"

I bend and tug my thumb.

[Kiri]
"Kyah! Do-, don't say it out... loud... HY?!"

[Taichi]
"It'll be soon... I'm gonna come, Kiri."

Moving with gentleness.

[Kiri]
"Haaah, hah, hahnh, aaahn, come...?"

[Taichi]
"You, Kiri? Gonna come?"

[Kiri]
"Don't... know... that... I wouldn't know, AAAH!"
//It's literally true given her Attributes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm coming inside!"

I twist while thrusting in.

[Kiri]
"AhNh, oh, oh... nooo, inside, you'll... get me pregnaaant..."

[Taichi]
"...then, bear my child!"
//see CCA0015 -GHS

[Kiri]
"...eh... child...?"

Carnality melts from her face, which is crossed by unease.

[Taichi]
"Let's become Adam and Eve!"
//See CCC3027. Jesus, Isaiah, and now this. All hidden in a sex scene that's him replaying the Sodom and Gomorrah used to indicate the Fall of Eden. -GHS

Squeeeze, the vagina contracted.

[Kiri]
"...then... me with... Senpai...?"

[Taichi]
"......"

The hell are you saying, me.
In this world?
Under this sky?
What sort of wish is even that?
I give my hips a savage rhythm.

[Kiri]
"Ahuh! gWah, nh... ah! Ah, nh, hah, hAhn! kYah, too hard, hAAA〜〜〜!"

[Taichi]
"...nh!"

The same instant she reaches the peak, I release into her depths.

[Kiri]
"KyahUh, hah, hyah... aaah! AAAH!!!"

I embrace her petite body from the back,
embrace tightly.

[Kiri]
"Hah, hyah... ahuh... ah... ah..."

Kiri's breath becomes choppy, as if coughing.
We both end up sitting on the floor.

[Kiri]
"Hy... uh, uh, uwaaah..."

Crying out.

[Kiri]
"...Kiri?"

Her head turns back to me, big thick tears on it.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka... just had to die... did he?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Kiri]
"...because he could only do that... to die... nothing else..."

[Taichi]
"To me,"

Yutaka is---
//He still doesn't know... and he'll never learn explicitly either, since the meaning is purely religious. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Senpai."

A demand for a kiss comes from Kiri.
//See CCD3003. This is no sudden characterizational 180: she was always in love with him, just like she always suspected Yutaka. -GHS
No sooner than we overlap, she presents the tongue.
Repeating what I was doing before, I give sweet bites to the full of the lips.
Playfully, cherishingly.
...resignedly.
And this,
is how Kiri became my property.
