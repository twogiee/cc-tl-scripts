At this early hour it's expected for morning practice to be in session.
There's also something of a morning practice for a cultural club, however.
//Yes, Misato's up at the antenna, but see CCC3004: the Broadcast Club is nominally a sports club, but there's meaning to this as social practice. Given some of Misato's mutterings in CCA0015B, it seems she knows, at least. And if so, it would explain why the choices appear reversed here. -GHS

"I'll be going to the rooftop for a bit."
[Taichi]
"Depending on how it goes I'll cut. If the homeroom teacher comes around, please answer roll call in my stead."

Touko made a scornful snort.
Does she think she can just look down on me so conspicuously?
That part of her I think naive,
because ignoring means pouring heart and soul into ignoring:
to remove value from the interlocutor one ought stand firm on a feigning of ignorance that fields no fangs, as if confronted by empty air.
//"She's not tsun enough". That's his complaint with Touko, his interpretative error, and his error in general: thinking people can be perfectly alone and independent. -GHS
The heart-felt intentionality of this aggression is inadequate. 25 points.
//2+5=7 -GHS
And when it happens, it ends up implying her position in my regards.

[Touko]
"...in your stead? What's that sleeptalk now."
//She won't do it because he's Taichi or there's no teachers coming: lack of mankind, opening day so they're all out at the ceremony, this being Class X... it's a Choose Your Interpretation here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm only being proactive."

I give my regular reply, and move towards the corridor.
//The other is the irregular one. -GHS

[Taichi]
"More than you are."

[Touko]
"Look who's talking..."

ANd yet, Touko does not push out one more word after that.
Half-standing from the seat she sends a glare towards me, but even that was just a wandering gaze.

[Taichi]
"If you get in the mood, come participate to club."

[Touko]
"......"

She looks at me as if she's seeing the enemy of her entire family.
//See CCD2002 -GHS
Anything more will likely only breed discord.
Exit the classroom in silence... I don't, and add one unneeded thing.
//Canot' hold himself back. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because I seriously love you."
//should connect to 'please participate' above. -GHS

The textbook (she had it) flew my way.
//Quite an important detail on rereading. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoopsie!"

I close the door, making it into a shield.
Wahahah... human relations are hard!
