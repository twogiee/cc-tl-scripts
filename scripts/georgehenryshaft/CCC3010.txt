Consciousness rises to surface.
I raise the periscope of bodily sensation.
//he a submarine now? *nightmare memories of Codename Iceman* -GHS
From the stomach's condition, this is three o'clock.
//Ah, yes, Three O'Clock, that damn Irishman who manned the conn on the Los Angeles (pronounced "los angles") class nuclear submarine USS what was its name-GHS
I had been asleep,
as if I had completely frozen up.
//Computer term references continue. -GHS
...thank you, my low capacity.
//There's http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA hmmm, but if it's more like it's http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1111321236 - which, given CCD1001, means it can be left unspecified. It means his rationality. -GHS
I opened my eyes.

[Taichi]
"......Miki?"
//WHY does this scene play with this music... -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes."

With a smile.

[Miki]
"This is Miki."

[Taichi]
"I..."

[Miki]
"Ah, please keep sleeping."

[Taichi]
"...on a lap pillow, you sure?"

[Miki]
"Provided you don't do any pervy things."

[Taichi]
"And if I do?"

[Miki]
"Depends on the degree of sexual harassment."
[Miki]
"If you attempt underwater navigation in my skirt, for example, I will shoot to kill."
//Shooting to death continues... as well as the nautical metaphor. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...SHAN'T."

[Miki]
"Then go ahead, please enjoy my la〜p."

[Taichi]
"OK!"

It's soft, and just a bit warm.
There's a nice scent.
The texture of the uniform, and the elasticity of young and tender thighs thereunder.
//He can't rub it, then he'll critique it (揉). -GHS
Beatitude.

[Taichi]
"I'm feeling sleepy again."

[Miki]
"Do sleep."

[Taichi]
"But then I won't be able to enjoy this."

[Miki]
"Heh heh heh."
[Miki]
"...I was surprised. I found you knocked unconscious."

[Taichi]
"I was sleeping."

[Miki]
"Again with that ridiculous everyday life..."
[Miki]
"But when you're like that, Senpai, you're at the best."

[Taichi]
"...am I?"

[Miki]
"When you're hilarious and funny, when you're like the revelry of a festival every day."
//See CCC3004. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"This became just a little too lonely, didn't it."

[Taichi]
"Damn if it didn't."
[Taichi]
"Whatever you do, you can't go from six billion to eight people."
//6[+0 the time loop]+8=14=7x2. -GHS

[Miki]
"It has effects on the survival of the species doesn't it."

[Taichi]
"Naaah, that it doesn't."

[Miki]
"Why? Why is that?"

[Taichi]
"Hah hah hah, but you know what I mean."

I extend my hands towards her butt.

[Miki]
"Psk."

Stabbed.

[Taichi]
"O-, oww! What's that?"

[Miki]
"A knife."

It was a combat knife.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, that looks dangerous! Why are you carrying that thing around!"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin told me to keep it."
//See CCC3016, it's a lie. But wait for it... -GHS
[Miki]
"Ah, that stab right now was not the knife, just my pinky's fingernail. Faaake, faaake〜"
//HER knife is a lie as well! -GHS
[Miki]
"There's no blood coming out so ease up."

[Taichi]
"Ah, right..."

I felt relieved.
Wherever possible I don't want to see blood.
It's very bad how easily that switch is toggled.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin might have a policy of non-aggressive defense, but aren't you wondering if she's going too far in the expansion of armaments?"
//See CCB2015 -GHS

[Miki]
"Miki thinks that too..."

[Taichi]
"Flowers are a symbol of peace!"
//I so wish that was an intentional typo, but I can't be certain. -GHS

I turn my head to the side without moving from her lap.
I bury my head near Miki's lower abdomen.
The Kyute Delta Zone was there, separated by several layers of clothes.

[Miki]
"Waah, ah!"

[Taichi]
"I'd say around this is a Grey Area."

[Miki]
"If you're going to do that, then we shall enforce our Moderate foreign policy!"

[Taichi]
"I am naught more than a Love Aristocrat, entranced by a beautiful delta you know!"

[Miki]
"Quibbling via sophistry are we. Well then!"

She produces a pole.

[Miki]
"Earpick!"
//Who better than for Miki, Master of Unlocking? -GHS

Ain't it nice.
A home-run level 'chewation, yeah.

[Taichi]
"Please. No, even if I say no, do it anyway!"

[Miki]
"...are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"Please rob me of my ear's virgin-ness."

[Miki]
"...ewww, that image!"

[Taichi]
"Makes the heart go boom boom, indeed."

[Miki]
"Well, if that is your desire..."

[Taichi]
"Be gentle, 'K..."

[Miki]
"I will use my discretion!"
[Miki]
"But I don't think that will be accompanied by good results."

...eh.
A rod is thrust into the ear.
!SCrAPE!
//'Tis the time to adapt SFX! The time of prophecy is at hand! ALL WILL BE DOOM!!! The 'r' is lowered for nooo reeeasooon whaaatsoooeeeveeerape -GHS

[Taichi]
"!!!!"

[Miki]
"And I immediately discover a Big Game!"
//Videogame-like commentary. -GHS

Scryaaape, scrunch, scah-rape!

[Taichi]
"OOO NOOhhh?!" (oh nooo?!)
//English. -GHS
[Taichi]
"PEIN! PEIN!" (pain! pain!)
//should i just use furrygana -GHS

And yet Miki did not stop.

[Miki]
"Hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh, so fuuu〜n, been so looo〜ng!"
//May refer to it having been the first time she's had this fun... or that this isn't the first time she's done this. Leaving ambiguous, and another line further below too. -GHS

She hungers for earpicking!
//Still think it's a Sinistar reference, see CCA0010 -GHS

[Miki]
"Liiike this like this."

Scrope, scruScrunch, wha-whack, swivel swivel swivel swiiivel!
//No idea about ごるっ or ざり... you know what, I don't think that's important. -GHS

[Taichi]
"GHYEEEeeeeee!!!"

This is not just pain:
this is Ear Torture, or if one wants to nonsensically abbreviate it, ExtraTerrestrial.
//Because ET get it get it get it well here's the explanation anyway. Original: 耳拷問 mimigoumon, ear torture vs. みみご mimigo, which is Fukuoka-ben (I guess?) for 'earwax'. Fits perhaps TOO well thematically now, given CCZAS. -GHS
Scryaaape, scrunch, swiiivel!

[Taichi]
"MIMIGAAA!!!"

Emitting the name of the pig's ear dish in Okinawan cuisine in a literally ear-piercing scream, I make pun of the truth in ways untranslatable.
//hee hee -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, if you move this will be dangerous."

Miki collapsed her seiza.
Panties visible for an instant,
//Hey, remember when she greeted Taichi like Nanaka in CCC3004? Now see CCB0002. Interesting. -GHS
filling me with transient euphoria.

[Taichi]
"What?"
//"Eh" + "to where" seems to work. -GHS

Legs wrap around my neck.
Thighs squeeze across my face.

[Taichi]
"What the?!"

This posture...
I was feeling the space (as in cosmos).
I am engulfed by a girl's loins.

[Miki]
"Better like this. HehShehSheh."

The torture implement (earpick) was inserted in the ear.
//Aren't these meant to be ruby text? -GHS
/ざりゅっ
Swuyvel!
//We might have passed the Point of No Onomatopetic Return already... -GHS

[Taichi]
"YAOU?!" (yow?!)
//Not this http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%9C%E7%8E%8B and this looks out of place: http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/23961/m0u/ ergo, going with the English scream onomatopoeia. -GHS

However, my head was held fixed in place.
It feels good, but it is inescapable. I do not want to escape, but escape I want.
//Hips and earpick respectively in both sentences. -GHS
Heaven and Hell,
simultaneously!!!

[Taichi]
"I and I'm Bae cormorant slightly example you y{ae} you we yeah you yah who just above the monument Warwickshire ridicule shake?!"
//BTW, GT has changed since I translated this line and it now returns something totally different and IMO not as funny. -GHS

Agony and ecstasy.
They dance in succession through me, and toss me about.

[Miki]
"Ah! Boss Class Discovered!"
//Still videogame-like commentary. -GHS
[Miki]
"Moving ever onwards to the attack!"
[Miki]
"Go〜, let's go〜, it's a scra〜mble, to our earpi〜cks♪"
//According to http://www6.ocn.ne.jp/~rejina/cc/motoneta.html it's the opening to this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendizer but I honestly don't hear it. Though, damn, that doesn't sound like the actress is faking that tone deafness... -GHS

Out she sings.

[Taichi]
"@!#?@!???"
//34575, hmmm, 6? 7-5-7-5, 12+12, 8x3? Mikaka gives ぁぅぇゃぇ, I don't really see it. Replaced with a classic arcade quote. -GHS
[Taichi]
"GOOOOOOYAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!"
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%84%E3%83%AB%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B7 ーx14 -GHS

The scream of an Okinawan cuisine delicacy (bitter melon this time) once again escapes my mouth.

[Miki]
"Guh, stubborn... weeell then, we go from the opposite side!"

[Taichi]
"GhyaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh!"
//ぁx29, hmmm, don't see it. Maybe 7x4 and the 1 is for that odd 6 above? Forced... -GHS

That instant, agony had exceeded pleasure.

[Taichi]
"Th-, that isn't earwax that is just my braaaaaaaaaaain!?!"

That's not true,
but since it's clinging inside so very hard, it's a fundamental organ and no mistake.
//BTW earwax cleaning's not a good thing to do for your ears. -GHS
Oh great Miki you are, somehow find it in you to not peel off that poor thing, please!

[Taichi]
"Wa-, please wait! That is surely a necessary organ for the the human body, yes! Inside the human body even things that give thought of meaninglessness most certainly have meaning still!"
//Line split -GHS
[Taichi]
"For example, the kyute Beany-chan that you possess has assuredly a proper gender-related meaning and---"
//It's referring to a part of the female anatomy that none of you virgins has ever seen firsthand. None of you are women either so stop protesting. Not that it matters since women are a legend of the time of the Black Ships. The PS2 version corrects this to a Double Switch(???) -GHS

[Miki]
"Drill atta〜ck, spirali〜ng♪"
//Still "singing" -GHS

[Taichi]
"EAAAAAAA!!!"

A scream that means 'nooo' in Japanese but in English sounds lik(snip).
//...ear. Expanded. -GHS
My ear braaain!!!
It's being flayed off with a scrubscrub-like sound!!!

[Taichi]
"Lobotomies ostracized!!!"

And then,
~veryh~
//I think this one shortened the lifespan of the universe by a few billion years -GHS

[Taichi]
"KHHHH!!!!"

I convulsed spastically in manners similar to a seductive cougar meeting orgasm.
//Possible reference, naturally, remains unknown. Possibly porn videos? -GHS
Being that my head is fixed in place, my limbs undulate about like earthworms.

[Miki]
"Done, got it ooout... whoooa, huuuge, 'maaazing, I WON!"

I diiied...
//Mirrors above -GHS
But I was released from this.

[Taichi]
"La-, lap pillow and thighs I have had my fill off, s-, so from this onwards..."

However, Miki said,

[Miki]
"Well. Then, let's subjugate the ear on the opposite side, shall we."
//Back to the military conquest metaphor -GHS

[Taichi]
"............eh?"

[Miki]
"Sooo then, so then, what formidable enemy do we have in the area on this side?"

My face is twisted around in the gap of her thighs.
Happiness!
In a gap of happiness I was thrust, then overturned.
//The gap, and himself. -GHS
The pole of the earpick is thrust inside.

[Taichi]
"G'hNYAAAAAAAAAAA?!"

The moderate foreign policy... is frightening!
Then,

[Taichi]
"...fwhaaaa..."

I was freed from the swooningly agonizing Dual Hole Virginity Piercing torture an adequate ten minutes later.
//悶絶 fainting-level agony/lesbian couples? I don't think that's what 'lesbian bed death' means. -GHS
The most extremely long ten minutes of my life, I could say.
//They'd be about 90 minutes. -GHS

[Miki]
"Satisfaction, satisfaction!♪"
[Miki]
"Want to see them? The spoils of war?"

[Taichi]
"Ah'm fine..."
[Taichi]
"Ohhh, I can hear so well!"
//She hasn't gotten his Pseudonietzschieian Bullshit Generator out, but given Sakuraba can hear better when he can't hear better, is this a good thing? He still can't hear the cicadas, for starters. -GHS

[Miki]
"It was really completely clogged!"

[Taichi]
"It's like another world."
//SY--- no. Not this line. This line gets booed. Therefore: boo! -GHS

[Miki]
"You are the very first to be delighted by my earpick, Senpai!"
//Earpick, not her earpicking: above she says it's "been so long". That may well refer to her having done it to him before; if so, she also knows that Kiri's about to get it pretty much in the same way, so this would be her pre-venge. -GHS

Indeed...
No, this is in no way delighting!

[Taichi]
"Rather should I say, that it is thanks to the powerful strength of my worldly desires that I withstood this."
//Given the meta above, I can only conclude that he managed to stick to his 'problem' because, well, it's not literally on his brain. -GHS

[Miki]
"Fwoh?"
//Fu=2, O=6 -> 8. As I've only figured this out like 15 months in, I probably missed a hell of a lot more... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Fwoooh hooh hooh!"
//2+^ x3 ???? -GHS

I laughed at her.

[Taichi]
"By the way, weren't you looking for Kiri-chin or something?"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, she was around? I didn't really find her."

[Taichi]
"But she was here until about three hours ago."

[Miki]
"Today I just can't really run into her at all."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Because of emotional instability perhaps.

[Taichi]
"Maybe she just wanted to be alone."

Which reminds me, the anniversary of the day that Yutaka died... is today.
//September 10th 1997 would've been a Wednesday. -GHS
Ahhh, that's it... that's why.

[Taichi]
"...well, how about leaving it at that for today?"

[Miki]
"Huh."
[Miki]
"...did she tell you something?"
[Miki]
"Or should I say, did you do something pervy to Kiricchi?"
//I still can't wrap my head around the idea that 'ero' is an i adjectives. IT DOES NOT MAKE SEEEEE-GHS

[Taichi]
"Di'n't!"

Denial in dialect.
//Unsure of which. I know, technically accent, but he's actually speaking Valley Girl so it's just you people not having a complete picture and totally not poetic license. Uhm, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dialect meaning 2. Ner with a further double ner. ...uhm, Valley Girl's a dialect right? Right. Worried it might, like, be a proper language and all. -GHS

[Miki]
"Iiis thaaat truuue?"

Well, it's true that I was going to do it.

[Taichi]
"I am a Love Gentleman I am!"

[Miki]
"You were going to, but you were told something harsh and were stopped."
//Meaning she knows he'd stop when asked. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"I see."

A master being seen through by his pupil (artist's impression).
//That's Miki's arc in a nutshell. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well... it was explained to me with skillful words how I am cray-zee."

[Miki]
"That's..."

[Taichi]
"Well, the truth isn't it."

[Miki]
"......"

Honestly, I was a bit depressed.

[Miki]
"Senpai... when you're in Nice Guy mode, I love you, you know?"
//See CCA0009A. Still no hint that she's aware of a "crazy ass murderer mode". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Do you want to kill me with faint praise? I am a veteran of a hundred battles, it is no easy thing to deceive me!"
//Rather than 'damning' with. More literal for more purple. And of course, he's being perfectly deceived. -GHS

[Miki]
"But you're totally an effeminate fop with a catty grin."
//Grinning like a cat + to be girly. Because cats are girls? Ah, that'd explain women, as well as cat ladies, and if we add nekomimi-desu, we have catgirls as well. It's all clear now! -GHS-nyan

Ahhh, my real identity!
//Meaning the above should be the pun. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then won't you marry me!!!"

[Miki]
"Why a marriage proposal in the middle of being angry even..."
//...but does Miki actually 'get' Taichi? -GHS
[Miki]
"Hmmm, well, sure!"

[Taichi]
"Eh, for real?"

[Miki]
"If Kiri-chin says it's OK."

[Taichi]
"HYPERHAAAARD!"
//超難しい -GHS
[Taichi]
"But, for the time being, could I perhaps have that in writing?"

[Miki]
"...that part of you is completely rotten I keep telling you."
