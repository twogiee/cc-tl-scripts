With manners nonchalant my hand extended towards the chest of this smiling girl.
//The hand did, not him. This is automatic behavior, see below. -GHS
Perhaps because it caught her unaware, Miki didn't make one movement as she stood there smiling.
Sqnjaaa!
When I come to notice, I was rubbing breasts.
//He's now de-automatized. -GHS
I flatly thought that there would be about nothing on this Chopping Board... but, weak as it may be, there is certainly that tactile sensation.
//OmotteITA sono ITA where ita = board... well at least that was easy to adapt. -GHS

[Miki]
"...dammit."

Still smiling, the edge of her lips begin to twitch.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, alien hand syndrome, it just went on its own."
//The moment when you realize that yes, that's correct, it did... -GHS

[Miki]
"No, it's my bad for having been careless."
//At least she understands responsibility (in a sense). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhm, I shouldn't exactly be saying this but... they've bulged out a bit. That's great!"

[Miki]
"Much obliged. When will this hand finally distance itself?"
//Formal here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"We've finally got some hope for the future here."
//Their conversation never crosses here. -GHS

[Miki]
"Hmmm, should I be happy, should I be angry? Well, for how long do you intend to continue touching this?"
//She's not kidding. She literally does not know! -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm deeply moved here. For the so tiny, nay, so tabular Miki has obtained the solid feeling of tridimensionality!"

[Miki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

I stop the hand going all rubby rubby and look at her face.
Miki was crying.
//Maybe she was actually offended at his calling her flat. Certainly, her reaction is not the right one. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wha, what?"

I made her cry?
I made her cry?

[Miki]
"...sniff."

Silent tears,
with sobbing neither, simply slipping down the curve of her cheeks.
If I were to imagine the tears flowing from an artist whose heart has been struck by beauty, this would be it.
//But is she impressed, or are these just fake? Impossible to understand at this point. -GHS
This is not the shedding of someone subjected to sexual harassment, it can't be.
I'm confused,
and then I stop,
because there's no understanding.
//It's mostly from Taichi, but it's from both sides in the end. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...uhm..."

Before long Miki well and wiped off her tears,
her forearms making a trip around and over her eyelids, and what came out behind them was her smile of always.
//往復, see CCA0015C -GHS

[Miki]
"Niheheh."
[Miki]
"Sooo, to cleaning, to cleaning!"
[Miki]
"But before that... s'yah!"

[Taichi]
"G'wohhh!"

My arm's pressure point (around the center of the forearm) was struck with the exact knuckletip of a fist.
//Hokuto no Miki. GIS 一本拳 for what exactly it means. -GHS

[Taichi]
"OwChCh, muscle reeeally hurts! When I clench my fist tight it hurts like an electric shooock!"

Writhing in agony go I,

[Miki]
"Sweep! Sweeeep!♪"
//Kohaku. -GHS

sweeping goes Miki.
Then,

[Taichi]
"...are you even Miki?"

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, nothing."

[Miki]
"Would that utterance be to the meaning that if I have presence of breasts then I cannot be Miki?"

Pah, I Imaginarily spat out.
//Meaning he didn't actually do it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Honestly, I'm disillusioned."

[Miki]
"Sho〜ock!"

[Taichi]
"How many fixated fans did you just lose?"
//The reason she isn't too loli (until that new CG in Kiri Sendback that is so loli I could only name the file itself as 'loli') is because Lolicon is a Disease. The word itself isn't exactly strange, but using something that means "fixed" in this story is always suggestive, especially considering this is a metareference. -GHS

[Miki]
"Fixated fans?"

[Taichi]
"Because it's not impossible you've been receiving the endorsement of those societally nonconforming people who make the kindergarten into their Holy Ground due to your having a flat chest, even if you aren't exactly loli..."
//And here's more from where that Fixated came from: "noncomforming" is the PC word for "people in Gunjou". I THINK TANAKA IS SAYING SOMETHING HERE TO PEOPLE WITH LOLICON BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT. And he's still being comparatively nice than to the Big Purty Words Mean Good Writing crowd. Also, notice the unsubtle way in which Taichi puts himself in this. See CCA0013: he was trying to groom Miki as he did Yusa. -GHS

[Miki]
"It's just the end of the world here!"
//Another of those cough-cough lines. Curiously, it appears Buddhist... but then again, Miki's known to pilfer from dem Christians, isn't she. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Miki you dummy, sorry for sexually harassing you!"
//Regression to tsundere. -GHS

Managing simultaneous words of scorn and of apology, I run away.
//This may be his reaction to her using a Buddhist aphorism. -GHS
