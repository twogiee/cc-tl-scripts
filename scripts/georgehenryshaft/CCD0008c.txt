[Miki]
"SeHnpAaAi..."

I was called from the back.

[Taichi]
"Miki..."

The corners of her eyes are red.
She really weeped her heart out.
//This is the consequences of her Reset. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Aw, you alright?"

[Miki]
"Somehow."

[Taichi]
"Live ooon, Miki yeeeah."

[Miki]
"It's bad it is, all this."

Spirits seems kind of under.

[Miki]
"The food, and the clothes, and the TV, what do we do for all that?"

[Taichi]
"Whatever. It seems it'll all be reset."
//If there's no reset, and all is reset nonetheless, then it's all provided and there's no problems of the sort. Simple! -GHS

[Miki]
"Weh?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, we'll get through with this somehow. Be at ease."

[Miki]
"...ngggh."

Losing heart.

[Taichi]
"Show us some high spirits now! Aren't you still my pupil?"

[Miki]
"But... this all here is so weird..."

[Taichi]
"The world and the times are weird!"

[Miki]
"Me's uneasy."

[Taichi]
"I'll put some Seaman's Spirit onto ya!"

[Miki]
"You'll give me some buck cake?"
//Original was pun between cheering up/addicting [her] to cake. Now it's even worse. -GHS

Touch on the breast.
F'meow.

[Miki]
"F'meow?!"

Quickly and lightly I went over it.
//I'll never translate Êèâ plainly will I. -GHS
I extend my hands towards her butt.
M'nyuh.

[Miki]
"M'nyuh?!"

So slenn'er. So soff'. So nayss'
So brittle. So way too brittle.
//She Kiri now? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Self-Destruct Button!"
//See CCA0008. Dire-hara not forbidden? -GHS

I press on the hook on her back.
Pressure and oscillation of the fingertip. The hook is undone with a margin of millimeters.
//Seems to mean that it's incredibly precise, not fast. -GHS
Paf.

[Miki]
"NaOhhh?!"

Bam, she quickly hugs the front of her chest.
But that plumb boylike chest needs no bra.
Fishing with a pole... is given a rest since she's just so pitiful.
//I'm using this as justification for the seamen j--- no, you know what, that was inexcusable. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Last strike!"
//Vaguely engrishy is good. -GHS

Gabachooo!!!
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabacho or http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%89%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AC%E3%83%90%E3%83%81%E3%83%A7 -GHS

[Miki]
"MWYAAAAAaAAAAAaAAAAAAAaAAAH!!!???"
//22/23x'A'??? 7x3+1??? 14+8? I guess, but... -GHS

The dispatched techniques all hit the mark.
//Unlike even the first week, heightening the suspicions again that she was either unreset all the way back then, or that she knows everything now and is just letting him. -GHS
This is our sufficiently pleasant Non-Guarded Miki.

[Taichi]
"Got some high spirits into ya now?"

[Miki]
"GOT-THEM-I-HAVE!"

Angered.

[Taichi]
"Then that's good."

And with that, I also managed to replenish my energy.

[Miki]
"Bleeech to you!"

She made a show of her short tongue and ran away.

[Taichi]
"Wahahah!"
//Oh, and in all this, surely we haven't forgot one certain red stain that ought to be here but isn't? -GHS
