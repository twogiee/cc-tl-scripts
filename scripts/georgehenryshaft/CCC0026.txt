Kiri was standing in the corridor.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin..."

Glare!, and I'm put under observation.
//HACK earlier music + awesome! -GHS
Undaunted, I return her a glare.
//HACK flash screen (uh, this might be nasty for some, but it's likely less harsh than it is in the console version - all of them) -GHS
DrRrRrRrRrRrRrRrRill!!! (psychological effect)
//x8, though x8 is the Standard Way to Write It (seriously google it). Although all E-J dics give "psychological effect", it's not really a thing, alone, in English. The closest would be 'placebo effect', though that's too explicit for this case. And once more, the similarities to 八 can't be discounted. -GHS
Back and forth of sights.
Hostilities with pressure, coiling into an eddy at the midpoint where they collide.
Damn wee lass!!!
//According to a 1796 Scottish regulation, usage of the words 'lad' and 'lass' is prohibited without the accompanying adjective 'wee', although in the case of 'lad' the prohibition is not always enforced. Going accordingly. -GHS
I reach into my breast pocket.
I'm gonna take out my special weapon!, screams the motion,
//Taking the sequence of words "as much as to say" out back and shooting it, BRB. -GHS
but in truth it's because my nipple was itchy.
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!!!"

Kiri was nervously vigilant.
Suddenly, she puts her hand in the pocket.
//Skirts with pockets... bah, she'll pull it out of her ass anyway. -GHS
The girl has has special weapon too!
//Yes, despite him NOT having one. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Gah!"

With hand still in the breast pocket, I strengthened the sharpness of my sight furthermore.
//HACK flash screen -GHS
CrackleCrackleCrackleCrackleCrackleee!!!
//Floating electricity -GHS
My antagonist doesn't remove the hand from her pocket either.
Deadlock.
Quick'n'draw.
//Non & sense -GHS
The first to move is finished.
//Debunked by Mythbusters too. -GHS
And there, going wipey-wipey on her hands, Miki came out of the toilet.

[Miki]
"Bwaaah, in the time I went to the toilet it turned into a fight sceeeeene!!!"

[Taichi]
"That's because I've come to rescue you, Miki!"
//HACK doll display disabled -GHS

[Miki]
"Scenario is me being held captive then..."
//Indeed, that's 設定 settei. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Step back, Miki."
//HACK doll display disabled -GHS

[Miki]
"No, I told you..."

Kiri slacks off her hips.

[Taichi]
"...huh."

I remove the tension from my shoulder.
And remove the hand.
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!"
//Watch out, here comes the Kurosu Conversation... -GHS

Empty hands mine, the kind you'd write kara-te.
//See CCA0016. These are the exact kanji for Karate. Of course he doesn't mean it, because he uses karaDe. That's why it's a cross conversation. -GHS
They flutter around delicately, showing my defenseless state.
//This can totally look like a battle readiness posture. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Our bluffs end here, Kiri-chin."
//This is a challenge. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I sport weaponlessness on my side. So gladden me by ceasing meaningless bluffs on yours."
//Specified, as this all but reads "I can kick your ass with Karate and you got nothing!" Cross conversation complete. Nice job, moron! -GHS

When use words like 'gladden' I am in all respects cool.
//This is to distract the reader, but not incorrectly so: he's not doing this on purpose, and this is evidence of that. Also why I had to specify it all around. -GHS
My nickname of The Aristocrat of Pure Love is no dandyism.
//See CCC3004, that 'pure' seems added here. Unchanged in all versions. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

Kiri took out her hand,
and it was grasping a crossbow.

[Taichi]
"...nya〜?"
//HACK disarm inset CG -GHS

It's a Buckmaster Manufacture Maxpoint Crossbooooooooow!
//ーx8. PS2 version focuses on its being American made. Very interesting in its own right. -GHS

[Taichi]
"WaitWaitWaitWait!"
[Taichi]
"That now was weird! A thing that size can't possibly fit inside a pocket!"
//Nor could she hold it one-handed within seven lifetimes. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

Wordlessly she aims the crossbow.
I know that on the other side of the scope Kiri is aiming at my heart.
//It's not visible in most CGs, but see CCC3012A, it's there. -GHS
I can feel a very very sharp sight.

[Taichi]
"You're aiming for a heart with the intensity of the desire the Tin Robot had?!"
//Hum. The reference to Oz seems obvious, but the Tin Man from Oz is called ブリキ男 (Buriki Otoko) not ブリキロボ (Buriki Robo). May be a conflation/censorship that also indicates Micheal Jackson is connected, see CCD4003. ...I can't even believe I wrote that. GIS "Buriki Robo" to see the design, it's common. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Please do not move. I will shoot!"

[Miki]
"AhWahWahWah!"
//The voice just says ahwahwah, I won't forgive this! -GHS

Miki-Miki's also quite upset.

[Taichi]
"Uncle, uncle!"

I raise my hands.

[Kiri]
"Ah, aiming got easier..."

She further refines her aim.

[Taichi]
"NOO! NOO! YAMETEEE!" (No! No! Stop!)
//This will sorta- return, see CCC0040. -GHS

Shake-shake, I shake my head.
It's to cry.
Or should say, I'm crying.
//See CCA0008, CCB0007 -GHS

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, Kiri-chin! That's bad! You'll be arrested!"

[Kiri]
"The police is gone by now."
//See CCA0030: non-interference in private matters. As long as the guards don't care... -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, right."
[Miki]
"Zooom..."
//The Mr. Saturn in Mother 2/Earthbound use ぽえ〜, so going with that. Since Boing is occupied by b00bs, using 'zoom'. -GHS

And she turned obedient.

[Taichi]
"Don't just asseeent!"

[Kiri]
"Get on your knees, hands behind your head."
//Standard police procedure* (*according to SWAT 3) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hyesh."

I abide.

[Kiri]
"...next, what do we do?"

A psst-psst of conversation with Miki.
It's still audible to me.
//Combined with the Cocktail Party Effect (but was it?) in CCB0005, as well as CCA0015B (and perhaps CCB2015), the implication may be that they're not talking loud enough to let him hear; he is simply of very sharp hearing, just like a dog or a cat. And since his superhearing would be a chuuni superpower like his night sight, that means he's not hearing squat and who knows what's actually happening. In fact, given Sakuraba, he might actually have a hearing defect; he certainly has a problem hearing the cicadas currently chirping out waaay loud. -GHS

[Miki]
"Did you disarm him?"

[Kiri]
"Doesn't seem to have anything with him."

[Miki]
"..."

Thinking over.

[Miki]
"Sooo, how about this?"

Whisper.
//First it was a very audible whispered conversation, NOW it's inaudible? Troll troll and troll. Woofx1 -GHS

[Kiri]
"...got it."

Kiri nods.
She might look all cool, but in the truth she is very much clinging on to Miki.
Therefore, she is a yes-man to Miki.
There was a route of escape there.
Because this is Miki-Miki, she will skillfully let me escape owing to the many years through which I have held her precious, no mistake.
//See Miki route. Interesting... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Please get on hands and knees and woof."
//See CCC4012. And around it goes. Woofx2 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Miki-Mikiii!!!"

[Miki]
"HehShehSheh."

A wicked smile.
Now that I am in this position, she can have revenge for my sexual harassment.

[Kiri]
"Hurry."

[Taichi]
"Guh, guuuh..."

No choice.
I get on my knees and grovel.
//Why u not 土下座 -GHS

[Taichi]
"...woof."
//Woofx3 -GHS

[Miki]
"I couldn't really feel the motivation so retake."
//HACK shake screen -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ghyaaa!!!"

Shame piles on top of shame.
It's the basics of the basics, but,
when I'm the one subjected to it, it's heartreanding.
//See CCC4012. Odd... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Retake, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Woof, woof woof woof!"
//Woofx7. Well hidden, wasn't it? The first woof is in Miki's order, which is unheard. But it matters, because... -GHS
[Taichi]
"How're you gonna complain about this now!"

[Miki]
"Ask him, who toldja to bark four times."
//Bark 4 times x1... -GHS

[Taichi]
"HEY!"
//I'm still perplexed at the lack of outbreaks of random australian in translations. I mean, they're closest! -GHS

[Kiri]
"Who told you to bark four times?"
//Polite, changed above for starker contrast. Bark four times x2, that's 8. That's the hint that the seventh actual 'woof' is in Miki's unstated order. Damn this one's well hidden. Also, because there's a hidden 7 and a rather blatant 8, the answer to this question is also given: a need for metareferentiality. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Okieh, I get it. So, whose shoes am I supposed to lick? Well?"

[Miki]
"Talking normally?"

[Taichi]
"I would be most grateful to be granted permission to lick, Princess-kun."

I laid my forehead on the floor.

[Miki]
"Our shoes would be filthied so we're good."

[Taichi]
"wHEY!"

[Miki]
"...sooo, next is a nude show yes it is〜!"

Miki... Miki is now a demon!

[Miki]
"Now remove your belows."

[Taichi]
"NOOOO!!! My body you caaaaan't!!!"

[Miki]
"Your life, your chastity: which of these is most precious to you, Senpai?"

Miki was waking up to the arrogance of the strong.

[Taichi]
"hYyynh..."

And thus I was in my underwear.
