"So, cleaning, can I help you?"

[Miki]
"You're in nice guy mode right now."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Miki]
"Because you come with two settings, Senpai, Sexual Harassment Mode and Nice Guy Mode. Eheh'ryh!"
//Can't source anything on that, uhm, moeword? See CCC3025, Yutaka's father has two optionals installed himself. Notice the absolute lack of Mass Murderer mode. -GHS

She pushed out a chest that you couldn't fondle by putting your hands on it.

[Taichi]
"Mnuh..."

[Miki]
"Ah, I've embarrassed you."

[Taichi]
"I am not embarrassed!"

[Miki]
"But you still took that so seriously."
//And guess who taught her? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's just clean instead. Hurry, we don't have time!"
//See CCC3027 -GHS

[Miki]
"Yessir!"

Grabbing back the rag that I had dropped earlier, I turn towards the uncleanliness.
//Intentional. -GHS
It was blood.

[Taichi]
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK???!!!"
//So it sounds more 'cutesy' now. Troll troll troll -GHS

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"A-, ain't that blood!"

I can't look straight at it.
//But he otherwise has no problems. This is supposed to be his 'cutesy' thing. -GHS
I hide my face behind the rag.

[Taichi]
"Hu-, hurry up and clean it awaaay!"
//Fuki-totte, that last one's Youko's thing (Remove). -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes, yes, please wait."

And before long,

[Miki]
"There, all done."

[Taichi]
"All clean now?"

[Miki]
"It's all done."

I unhide my face from behind the rag.

[Taichi]
"Ngggh, I'm weak to blood."

[Miki]
"So you had an adorable side to you."
//This may be how she knows, see CCB0008A. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Honestly, that's harsh..."
//See CCA0004, he could be talking about her as well as the blood. -GHS

I still feel sick despite having just glimpsed at it.
//IOW he didn't really see if it's blood. And she wiped it away in like .3 seconds! This is ridiculous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry for being useless."
[Taichi]
"Please abuse this worthless pig..."
//Connection that mascara thing was unintentional, but I guess it works too. Notice the pattern: see blood -> feel sick -> desires abuse. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ehhh...?"

[Taichi]
"Like an oinker treat me."

[Miki]
"...theeen..."
[Miki]
"Piggy wants to pig out in the pigpen?"

[Taichi]
"Ngh!"

That arrangement being then put in the form of a question made it oddly painful.

[Miki]
"Rather than the pigpen, would you like to go the infirmary?"
//Is there a law that requires calling it "health room"? No, seriously, I want to know. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Naaah, I think I'll be alright."

[Miki]
"...uh-huh."

[Taichi]
"I'll be alright!"

[Miki]
"Let's take a nice daytime nap while we're there."

[Taichi]
"Guh..."

That proposal made the hair on the back of my head stand way up.

[Miki]
"There are at least two beds there."

[Taichi]
"Wellbye."
//Compressed. -GHS

[Miki]
"Dear me...?"
//Girly. Well, we've been assured she IS a girl, at least. -GHS
