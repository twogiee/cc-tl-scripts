I search for Kiri.
For some purpose.
Apology.
Or perhaps...
//To have her kill him. -GHS
I don't get it.
//Leans towards the understanding than the knowing. -GHS
Moved by an impetus, I roam about the school building.
Senpai and Kiri were there.
Tomoki and the other don't seem to have come back yet.
//Sakuraba ergo "the other" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Miki."
//HACK zoomed BG... and actually FADE the damn doll. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, how wHas Kirihara-semhpai?"
//Bit munched. Don't see the pun, if there's one. -GHS

My heart takes a tiny leap.
But it was no more than that.

[Taichi]
"...she was full of energy. I was hated with full energy."

[Miki]
"Oss, as I forecasted."
//"He lied to me thinking of making me a favor, and she's dead as that's as likely as Shmion going crazy whoops did I spoil the reason why that episode was subtitled 'the highest probability' was cribbed by Cross Channel as well." -GHS

[Taichi]
"As I did as well."

We laugh in a duo.

[Taichi]
"How's work?"

[Miki]
"A bit like this, a bit like that."

[Taichi]
"...is that good, is that bad?"

[Miki]
"It seems like we're managing somehow? Feels like that."

[Taichi]
"Good then."

[Miki]
"Still, just now there was the sound of an explosion inside the school!"
//Prolly just the student uproar as Taichi was grabbed and pulled out. -GHS

[Taichi]
"B'uh."

That was heard faaar away...

[Miki]
"This one has been, until recently, tightly hugging Mimi-senpai while half-crying and shaking with rattle and clatter both, and due to that progress has slowed."
//Suddenly Taichi-sh. Hum, has she heard any explosion at all? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Woooh, ain't that a pretty image."

[Miki]
"But what was that...? Honestly, I wanted to go to the toilet but I was scared and didn't go inside the building."
//TL: "I know this happened in the toilet." -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you do it in front of my eyes, I'll bring in a portable toilet!"

[Miki]
"Bwaaah... disturbing..."

She held her head, at wits' end.
But I should say, this isn't the time for that stuff.

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Truth is, that was my handiwork."
//HACK surprised Miki -GHS

[Misato]
"S-, so it was then... so in the end, what was it that happened?"

Glasses were tilted and clouded.
She seemed seriously shaken.

[Taichi]
"An alarm clock."
//HACK obviously suspicious Miki instead -GHS

[Miki]
"...defective product wasn't it."

[Taichi]
"Ergo I tossed it!"
//Well, it's true. -GHS

[Misato]
"So that is what it was... I am so glad... it is not terrorism or anything of the sort."
//Oh, wouldn't this make more sense post-2001? Maybe the world has progressed that far. However, considering the 1995 Tokyo Sarin gas attacks, I guess the term can date back to then (hard to research, very little statistics on term usage in Japan in the '90s). Well, at worst it's a minor anachronism. -GHS

[Taichi]
"There are no more people who would do terror attacks, that is why."
//HACK normal Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, then I'm off to the toilet!"

Miki leaves, flapping her arms around like a bird.
//HACK to sky -GHS

[Taichi]
"Make sure to fluuush!"

[Miki]
"That's an instruction you don't have to giiive!"

[Taichi]
"Big? Small?"

[Miki]
"It's the small one if-you-wanna-knooo-ow!"

She sticks out her tongue then goes into the building.

[Taichi]
"...and in passing, I too, just got to..."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

In a calmer tone of voice.
//Moved doll down here, centered, back to rooftop. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

[Misato]
"...it might just be that I need to thank you, I believe."
//Not quite clear what this is for. Perhaps for Youko helping her, and by that she means him? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Thank me?"

[Misato]
"No, it is nothing. What are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Sigh, I am trying to search for Kiri-chin."

[Misato]
"You bullied her again did you?"

Just as if that had been nothing but a pleasant little event.
//Given how she could've kicked him off seven times... and how much of a prick she's been to him... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...yes, a bit. Sorry!"

[Misato]
"No, it is her that is important now, so properly follow up on that, please."
//"but senpaaai, she's blocked me on twitter!" -GHS

[Taichi]
"So I shall."

And with that I pile up another lie.
//Except this is not a lie, since he IS going to try to make things up... -GHS
I follow up on Kiri's presence.
She's walked this way, therefore... the classroom?
She hasn't left the school building... I think.
Into the first years' classroom.
And then---
There she was.
That defenseless back she always shows.
//He could creep up and kill her without a problem... -GHS
First, get close and talk to her.
//Touko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ah, uhm, Kiri-chin?"

What do I even think I want to do here?
I don't get it.
Apologize,
destroy,
I don't get it.
And this me who doesn't get it is... unpleasant.

[Kiri]
"..."
//HACK CG change. This seems to have been a bug, as Kiri would never look at Taichi throughout this scene. -GHS

Turning around, Kiri said,

[Kiri]
"You are... a filthy rotten murderer."

Speechless.
As a rule, those aren't words I should be hearing from an underclassman.

[Taichi]
"...we-, well, you being angry is quite natural, but... right?"

[Kiri]
"Angry?"
[Kiri]
"This isn't an emotion that simple."
[Kiri]
"You are... the enemy. You are---"

Quiet voice,
quiet features,
quiet... indictment.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka's... murderer."

[Taichi]
"......"
//He doesn't want her to think that. He doesn't want her to know who Yutaka was! -GHS
[Taichi]
"Fine, I give up."
[Taichi]
"...what even makes you think that?"

[Kiri]
"Because I know."
[Kiri]
"On that day, you were talking to Yutaka on the rooftop."

[Taichi]
"......"

She had known.
She had known, she had known.
Kiri had known about that.

[Taichi]
"That day?"

That cannot be.
The heart, in a single go,
freezes entirely.

[Kiri]
"The day Yutaka died."
[Kiri]
"...I had always... suspected you."
//See below -GHS
[Kiri]
"But... I didn't know."
//She did not SEE Taichi push Yutaka down. Compare with Miki and the old man's body, or the handshake. She loves to rush to judgment. -GHS
[Kiri]
"That's why I didn't want to be involved with you in any way."
//She suspected him, didn't know, and decided to just cut off relations instead of asking. Of course Taichi's kissing her was a very very stupid thing to do, but did that justify thinking him a murderer without evidence? In the end, the question is pointless; no one here's without blame. The question is if there'll be forgiveness. -GHS
[Kiri]
"But... there was involvement from you."

Kiri's eyes had confidence in them.
An aggressive color dwells in her pupils, led there by a flame no longer smoldering or sputtering, but blazing.
//Totally Toukoin'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wait up a second there! Ain't this weird?"
[Taichi]
"...let's say I even went and killed Yutaka, do you think I'd even come up and talk to you?"
//Tooouko. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I do not think you would come talk to me,"
[Kiri]
"normally."

[Taichi]
"Of course... I'm not normal, no, but..."

[Kiri]
"We are nothing more than game to you."
[Kiri]
"You were only satisfying a hunger."
[Kiri]
"The normal of people is inconsequential. Because of the kind of thing you are."
[Kiri]
"...you devour human hearts, beast that you are."

[Taichi]
"......"

She just says whatever she pleases.
//To his absolute non-reaction. She'd be dead five times over now if she was right. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Say now... me and Yutaka were buds, weren't we. Got no reason to kill him."

[Kiri]
"No such thing as a motive needed."
//Correction: seven times over. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Hunger is the only reason."

[Taichi]
"Nggg〜〜〜h."

I scratch my head.

[Taichi]
"Well then, why would I go out of my way to intentionally pick Yutaka as game? Let's say that I'm a beast, and that I see other people as game, there's that thing how I prefer girls to men, noticed that?"
//He's trying to AVOID having to tell her that her brother was a rapist. Acts, not words. With the ironic consequence that he is wrong to do *this*, not what he'll do later on! -GHS

[Kiri]
"...are you worried about the gender of fried chicken?"

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

A comeback for every remark.
//Should remind of Miki. She was the one to train her, very likely. -GHS

[Kiri]
"At the very least... the eyes you watched me with... were that."
//Focus on eyes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm telling you that's not true... welll,"
//3xl -GHS
[Taichi]
"I'm a man, so there's lots and lots that makes me, uhm, rise and stuff."
//Sorta-literal seems to be "spur me on", but let's just say it's not even subtext, really. -GHS

[Kiri]
"It is different from... that."

[Taichi]
"You have experience with it?"

[Kiri]
"...I do not! But, I understand as far as saying that it is something heterogeneous."
//IOW, she's saying it's not Taichi's sexual urges... which are things she knows absolutely nothing about. The girl doesn't even masturbate! Her annoyance at sexual harassment, much like everything, may just be an erroneous reaction to internal movements she doesn't understand. Her hate for Taichi is certainly nothing of the sort. -GHS

She does, this girl here.
That was some insight.
Maybe it's the power to see through malice,
maybe it's excessively sharp acumen.
//Maybe it's projection. Except for the maybe. And Taichi is a whiny moron. But it is true, in the troll sense: Kiri is angry at the darkest sides of Taichi, which she sees... except they're no mo real than her behavior against Taichi is hatred. What she can't stand is Taichi's fakeness. -GHS
If seen with eyes like that, I can nod in assent: the world is frightening.
With all that circumstantial evidence and intuition, perhaps that's why all space for doubt has vanished.
//Kiri's ultramarine if there's ever been one. Sharp, perhaps, but so damn easily convinced of ill intent. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I've always suspected."
[Kiri]
"But, these few days... I have let my guard down around you."
//Her plan to walk through town from the isolated spot she lives in to a place right beyond the house where your Sworn Enemy lives isn't letting your guard down, it is imbecilic in ways that border the bad writing. -GHS
[Kiri]
"That is regrettable..."
[Kiri]
"But,"
[Kiri]
"that is how I understood your true shape."

Kiri sank her hand outside of the window,
//Third floor at Suicidal Psychopath High (see the rooftop), and the window has no bars and is not locked. It's so damn blatant I'm not even sure this isn't a plot hole. -GHS

[Kiri]
"You are..."

dragging up,
a cloth parcel.
//This is what Miki went to deliver. Technically a small one. Hum, toilet + weapon = Godfather reference? -GHS
Was it set against the step on the outside of the window?
//Without images it's a bit tough to tell, especially since the sex CG shows little more than a sheer drop... not that it matters since this probably never happens. -GHS
She removes the cloth and,
//This is even better seen in the 800x600 Reprint edition data, but, for what little the CGs can be trusted, the clock has no hands. Since this is a detailed version of the classroom BG, it's confirmed what can still only be sort-of made out - the clock in this generic classroom seems to not point out the time at all... -GHS

[Kiri]
"A filthy rotten murderer."

[Taichi]
"..."

A second one... in other words, Miki also had one for herself.
Me, having been magnificently reeled in: that's the name of this composition.
//This random duped line's slightly different, not enough for a much different translation. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Do not move, please."

[Taichi]
"This is sooo embarrassHing for a man to say, but... Youko-chan'll be angry you know."
//Cutesy -GHS

[Kiri]
"That is fine."
[Kiri]
"As long as I can just eliminate you."
//This contradicts CCA0019A entirely. Note the implication that Youko won't be a problem if Taichi dies. See CCB0022: Miki going all "kill him" as Taichi goes into its own internal delusions would make sense in exactly this way. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oookay."

[Kiri]
"Who will it be after me? President-senpai? Kirihara-senpai? Or maybe... Miki?"
//She keeps assuming him not having killed her yet somehow still means he'd kill her later on. That's as odd as Youko somehow failing to kill her in a surprise attack. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I won't be making anyone my prey!"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

If I can just maintain my most sacred of selves.
//(He's not referring to split personalities here, just his behaviors.) -GHS
People are the one thing people seek, however,
if the partner is just used a pretext for the self, it's all over.
//Meaning the other side seems to become all-important, but it's just projecting the self on them. See CCC3012A for the most described example on Youko. -GHS
But before that happens, wouldn't you inevitably keep your distance?
//Youko is the easiest example again, though this deals more with isolation in general. -GHS
Because, in this world, there is no kindness.
And I know Kiri understands this, but,
//See CCC3007 -GHS
do you understand this contradiction... Kiri?
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Kiri]
"I have no duty to believe you."

She aims the weapon.
At this distance I expect a direct hit.
This distance and the distance with the tree Kiri practiced with overlap.
She likely won't miss.

[Taichi]
"...you do realize you'll end up dead too if you kill me?"

[Kiri]
"I do not care."

She smiles.

[Kiri]
"Because either way the world has already ended."

[Taichi]
"But the people you hate aren't anymore."

[Kiri]
"...this was never about wishing them to be gone."
//Meaning they're not necessarily gone... -GHS
[Kiri]
"I only wanted for them to act correctly!"
[Kiri]
"...even you..."
//Dawww, she lurves him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

Pure unmixed murderous intent.
It crystallizes, and becomes a tiny design that surrounds Kiri, coloring her.
//Is that you, 綾? -GHS
If I die, Kiri also dies.
A resignation to her fate,
identical to Touko's.
//Again the crux of the matter. -GHS
There is a part of me that thinks that is a very good thing.
//Not Kiri's death, but resignation. Death for *him*. -GHS
On the other hand, there is also a longing for others.
I want memories,
I want to record them,
I want to engrave them on my heart.
If there's even just memories, if there's even just those shining jewels---
...I might just be a beast that makes food of people's feelings, I don't know.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Kiri]
"Do you have anything left to say before you die?"

On notifying me of that, Kiri's hand shakes, pitifully.
//Glasswork Kiri, that to touch is to break, who can barely lift up a TV monitor, can obviously hold that thing up single-handed for ten minutes and hit something. Sure, a CRT TV will likely weight 3+ times that crossbow, but that's obviously not the problem here... -GHS
She's frightened.
Murder is frightening.
The heart is strained with all its might.
To burst that balloon of unease and rationality all that is needed is a tiny little stimulus.
Just the tip of the needle.
...there is a way to be saved.
And also the thought, shouldn't you just die you bastard?
//死んでやろう -GHS
Hesitation.
IF $KIRIBAD == 1 JMP RT_BAD001
