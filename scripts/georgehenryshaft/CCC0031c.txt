There was Sakuraba,
sleeping in a bed.
//See CCA0016... but first, see CCC0025. That script touched on something of Yusa, who has more than a few parallels with Misato, as well as the hexagon thing that will return in the Misato Sendback scene. Him being asleep in the infirmary should be taken to be the reading key for the same scene in Week 1. Unfortunately, I think CCB0005 works much better, but I suppose further evidence is always good. -GHS
Belly out, fast asleep.

[Sakuraba]
"...snooooooore."
//"Snore". First a sound, contrast Misato's sobbing... -GHS

Snoring.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba?"

[Sakuraba]
"What?"
//...then a perfectly normal answer, contrast Misato calling Taichi back. -GHS

He answers normally.
//Reading key: at least one of of these is not happening. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Feeling off?"

[Sakuraba]
"Ate too much curry bread."
//Ridiculous! See CCC0024 again: he came to school hungry, and this is just Tuesday. See CCC3012b: he won't get tired until Thursday, possibly evening. Like with the oddities in CCC0027, this is Taichi slowly fraying into excessive chuuni, just like in Another Story. -GHS

Is he awake?
But his eyes are closed.

[Sakuraba]
"Been eating curry bread for four periods."

[Taichi]
"You dumbass."

[Sakuraba]
"I expect to earn a considerable amount of school credit."

[Taichi]
"Uhm, we're not on a credit system."

[Sakuraba]
"Tiny detail. I don't care."

[Taichi]
"You should care about that!"

[Sakuraba]
"I can't eat anything anymore."

[Taichi]
"Seems so..."
[Taichi]
"I got sandwiches though."

[Sakuraba]
"Snooore."
//PCP above -GHS

Asleep.
Could it be that everything so far has been sleeptalk?
//Or could it be the opposite, that this conversation has been entirely in his mind? Or a reading key for CCA0016? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Friendship demands..."

[Sakuraba]
"Nothing in return."

We stuck our thumbs up.

[Sakuraba]
"Snooore."

[Taichi]
"Totally untroubled this guy here..."

He's not to be underestimated.
