The antenna assembly appeared to be only progressing laggingly.
//HACK music starts a bit later, zoomed rooftop BG -GHS

[Taichi]
"Senpai?"

[Misato]
"...nah... nwhaa?"

[Taichi]
"Already this sleepy in the morning, really, what is the big idea!"

[Misato]
"Nah, but I am not sleeping?"

She rose herself with a wobble.

[Misato]
"First thing, good morning!"

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"If you sleep here in the middle of the day you will die of sunlight exposure, you know?"

[Misato]
"Ah, yes, that is right, I was careful."

Senpai lifts the hem of her skirt and wipes her glasses.
//See CCD1001, she's back to being a little girl. -GHS
...panties are visible.
Most certainly half asleep, indeed.
It can't be, she didn't pull an all-nighter and spend the night here?
That, I didn't have the guts to ask.
//Regardless, he's about to have a memory reset. -GHS
Plump and squishy thighs...
Speaking on the topic of modern day Japan,
//1998. Not that it changed much. -GHS
we have those transgressors of societal mores & legislations that head in full career towards lolis known as Loliskis.
//Loli-suki, loli lovers. -GHS
The absence of lolis in a part of the media would for them be a state of affairs impermissible.
This Kurosu Taichi here would like to push out a few words to the heart of that culture!
//The base isn't a cleaned-up version, it's a rip of the 360 version which has no text because the whole scene was removed despite the graphics remaining (Taichi seems just as puzzled as the reader should be, too). -GHS
That is a disease.
//Readers are intended to think that Taichi is currently two-timing Yusa and Misato, as well as flirting with everyone, perhaps even think this is him rationalizing it and/or being a hypocrite about it. See CCA0020 and Boob Wars for more on big boobs vs. flat chest, see CCC4012 for the gas mask. Curiously, Yusa and the gas mask are never seen together... that we know of. -GHS
The youngins may be adorable, sure, but these plump thighs and that light sky-blue groincloth are themselves also a very nice thing.
//Annnnd gone. -GHS

[Misato]
"Nyahmh..."
//Nyan, desu-nya. -GHS-desu-nya

She kills a yawn in her teeth while wiping her glasses.
Unembellished.
//See CCA0006. Odd. -GHS
Senpai here is unembellished.
The skirt returned to its original position with a paf,
//Pasari. http://www.pasari.jp/ ~yume miru pasari::I'm not sure what it is but it seems food and now I'm hungry~ -GHS
and Senpai wears back her glasses.

[Misato]
"I am so sleepy..."

[Taichi]
"Indeed you are."

[Misato]
"Uhm, what were you here for?"

[Taichi]
"A task, please."

[Misato]
"Why are you talking with your back turned?"

[Taichi]
"At this juncture I should express the reason as being rooted in a three-dimensional problem."
//Indeed, the thrust of the problem seems traceable upwards on a straight line to a three-dimensional issue, on which he is currently and most pointedly raising his attention in the hopes of decreasing its unyielding solidity. -GHS

[Misato]
"Philosophical! That is very philosophical!"
//Actually, the kind of tangible hard things that philosophers tend to concentrate on for hours at an end is somewhat above that. Notice she notices; she's just teasing him. -GHS

The true reason is corporeal as well as vulgar, however.
//He, however, doesn't notice she does. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I will be participating to club activities, ergo, a task please."

[Misato]
"Awww..."

Senpai began grumbling in mutters.
Even if I stand my ears at attention, I can't quite hear it all.
//As intentional as that thing in CCA0012. -GHS
It's just fragments:

[Misato]
『all worried, like an idiot』
//Both of them. -GHS
[Misato]
『this is not about running away』
//Both of them. -GHS
[Misato]
『like a doggy』
[Misato]
『emotional attachment』
//Both of them... -GHS
[Misato]
『not like he is that much of a bother』
[Misato]
『as a target of socialization』
[Misato]
『of course, I am the elder』
//Bothification(?) aside, "he's worried that I'm running away but I'm not really, except I sorta like him/he sorta likes me, and I could use help, plus he needs someone to socialize with, so I gotta act as the senpai". Process of self-conviction of likely foregone conclusion. -GHS
[Misato]
『Hic!』

Last one's a hiccup.
The hell's wrong here?
She's always been the subtly weird kind of lovely lady, but today she's completely broken.

[Taichi]
"Se-, senpai?"

[Misato]
"Script..."
//げんこう genkou is also 減光, "reduce illumination". She's drunk and likely photosensitive, so she could be confusing the two terms. Except she's seriously looking for the script and there doesn't seem to be any followup on that. This might be a joke that Tanaka himself missed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Please do a scriiipt!"

So she says with groggy eyes.

[Taichi]
"A script, what for?"

[Misato]
"A script for use in the maiden broadcast of the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, in other words, you want a scenario to wibble-wibble out in the air with the antenna."
//That's totally denpa terminology, isn't it. Yun~yun http://www.paradisearmy.com/doujin/pasok7q.htm -GHS

[Misato]
"Indeed. The demanded item impresses with its intelligence, it is tears as well as truth. Shall we not persistently strike the earlobe of listeners with the thoroughly refreshing good old youth culture resurrected by the hands, no, the voice of our Broadcast Club!"
//Technical, precise, slightly deranged and damn verbose - this was NVL until basically the fifth or sixth rewrite. Overliteral about the ears continues with "striking the earlobes", even funnier considering Mimi = ears. -GHS

A lot of alcohol bottles were scattered at Senpai's feet.
//And he only notices now? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oooooooh?!"
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
HACK This is intended to be a single line, especially obvious since the very filename used to be split and, as can be heard, the audio flows waaay better when joined. It's almost an insult to the actress that this wasn't preserved somehow. This isn't even in the console versions, so this is the first time this has ever been heard in ten years. -GHS

[Misato]
"A deficiency in morals, an exaggerated

selfish individualism, the utilization of
fundamental human rights for the purpose of
overindulging oneself in laziness: are youthful
ones like you and me still capable of making
friends with which to grow each other in a modern
society polluted by that sort of Nice Children
Hazards? It is my conviction that our Gunjou
Institute Broadcast Club can possibly tender
a satisfactory response to that question!"
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"You are good at Japanese indeed."

[Misato]
"Huh huh huh, hic..."
//Last one's a hiccup -GHS

Laughing,
her tightly clenched fist loitered in the air unsteadily, then dived into her pocket.
It came out,
and tightly grasping a single serving of cup sake.
//Vs. cup ramen. http://www.ozekisake.com/products/product_detail.php?product=21 Leaving sake as it seems to be literally that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahh, ahh, ahh..."
//Realization reloaded -GHS

She's wasted.
Her figure as she drains that in one gulp was once more lovely.
//Indeed someone with Taichi's backstory wouldn't find this problematic. -GHS
She's like a middle-aged working man now...
//And now, criticism of your average Japanese salaryman. -GHS

[Misato]
"Sooo write that scrip'."

She says, with eyes that look like they've been through glasses.
//Drunken eyes <-> "sitting" eyes, just a bad pun. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Y-, yes..."

[Misato]
"Cofferdam gets struck on Sunday."
//It's just a pretentious way of saying "deadline". Today you learned: Alpha is a kanji! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes ma'am!"

[Misato]
"It is entrusted!"
//Bit weird, but she's wasted + other pun below. -GHS
[Misato]
"Zhen, Eh entruhst zhe vriting of zat skript to yuhr handz, vihle Eh zhink Eh vill be layink dovn hehre for a vhiiile!"
//Still used the same T2S thingie in CCA0006. Accent's pretty damn thick, so I cut down a little. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You a foreigner now?"
//Sleepy Misato is childish; drunk Misato is a hardcore libertarian. -GHS

[Misato]
"Uuugh..."

She lies sprawled on the floor.

[Taichi]
"Why you worthless...!"

[Misato]
"Mfhehehehehe!"

[Taichi]
"Senpai! Senpai, seriously!"

[Misato]
"Whsprn..."
//Suka = nonsense. Suka子? -GHS

She's asleep?
That serious Senpai, in vino veritas...

[Taichi]
"Uhm, at least... could you sleep in the infirmary or something?"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, entrustman..."
//Yoroshi, but since 子 (ko/child) is also shi, yoroko due to personification. -GHS

And with words that personify the concept of entrustment, Senpai abdicated all responsibility to me.

[Taichi]
"Really, you want me to carry you in my arms like a child now?"
//See CCD1001 -GHS

[Senpai]
"Kusuh, kusuh..."
//Foreign SFX. -GHS

[Taichi]
"When I might cop a feel of your boobs or your butt or something?"
[Taichi]
"You might wake up and find that your panties are gone, you know?"
[Taichi]
"And when you're awake... 'why is Omata all breezy, what's that... oh noes, I'm not wearing my panties?! What is this?! Did I do something slovenly?! no waaay... that'd be... yuck... ah! I'm getting all wet... have you gone all mad, girl?!'"
//HACK shake screen -GHS
[Taichi]
"No, the question is, have you gone mad, BOY!"
//...which is why the point is that HE is going into the girlishness, not imitating Misato's speech at all. Therefore, it's a pronouns thing (watashi vs. ore). That last thing is North Kanto/Tohou. Wait, Tohoku still hasn't changed name to Tohou? What are they waiting for? Think of all the tourists going to literal Bullet Hell! What could possibly go wrong! -GHS

I struck at my temporal lobe.

[Taichi]
"Seriously..."

Helpless people aren't we.
//Either works. -GHS
First thing, raise Senpai's upper body.
Plump!
//Soff'. -GHS
Her necks limps to one side.
//How much stuff does he do to sleeping people anyway? He certainly pesters sleepy Touko lots. -GHS
She's seriously asleep.

[Taichi]
"...ahhhh, I feel... I feel something really wrong here..."
//His pervert instincts are taking over. -GHS

Squeeez'!
I hugged her,
squish the pit of her stomach, and had a twin balloonlike sensation.

[Taichi]
"That moved me to tears..."
//See CCA0012. -GHS

And for the next thing to move me to tears...
Tamper with a rustle around the middle of the upper back.
Bra hook detected.
Undone (time required: 0,5").
//Self-destruct button? Well, that he knows all sorts of embarrassing sexual techniques shouldn't be surprising for a first time reader, all things considered, but it's really uncommon for this kind of character to be able to quickly undo bra hooks. It's of course because he's worn bras. -GHS
Shift the bra itself, and from the gap of the frontal stoppers, and carefully, caaarefully, move to slip it out.
//It seems to have no shoulder straps, same will be in CCD1001. Odd for someone with boobs that size... -GHS
Accompany its skin-induced warmth to the tip of one's nose.
//Purple. -GHS
What. A. Scent.

[Taichi]
"...compensation for health services has been certainly received, Misato-senpai."

It ends in my pocket, and Senpai goes on my back.
Heavy with measure,
but the double sensation adequately riding on my back is unbearable.
Especially this chest,
because behind a single layer of shirt, it is now raw.
My excited breathing goes nasal and rough, and a tent is also erected.
//Curiously, the term used here reads "setsuei", like this Tanaka-supervised project: http://vndb.org/v660 -GHS
That was the birth of Tentman.
//Anthropomorphizing of his tent. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, let's go."

Who's looking at us now anyway?
//HACK changed these to another unused FX that looks more appropriate than a Star Wars wipe. -GHS
Cut it out, cut it out!
The feeling bouncing on my back unbearably wonderful, I ended up pointlessly doing the rounds of the school grounds.
Well then,
there's no people in the infirmary.
//Gunjou having an infirmary but no nurse on duty's par for the course. -GHS
I lay Senpai to sleep in a free bed.

[Taichi]
"Good night, Senpai, and sweet dreams."
[Taichi]
"..."

Prezy-kiss!
//This is written Buchuu, which is a hideous combination of President and kiss. See CCA0029 for "payoff", such as it is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Now then."

The beginning of this day was all narrow dodges.
...wait, those were the cheeks?
//Where he kissed her nobody knboobs -GHS
