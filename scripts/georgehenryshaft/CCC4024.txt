[Taichi]
"We're together part of the way."

[Miki]
"Yes."

Walking.
//Copyp--- whoa, it isn't? -GHS
On the way, Miki linked hands.

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

[Miki]
"I'll be borrowing this!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

So meek.
//OMFGLOL THERES A GOD KANJI THIS MEANS RELIGIAN -GHS
Miki's hand was so tiny and so slender.
It's with these hands that she has acted as arbitrator in this world of only eight people, and lived on.
The timing with which she kicked me as I ran, of course,
but also in her movements when she rescued Miki on the rooftop.
Those were not trivial things.
//The latter, more importantly, is an act that gainsays her solipsism. -GHS
She's someone who leaps off of the rigidification of the moment and into the act.
//The rigidification of the moment is an interesting concept to bring up in a world that's become still in action and time, even if just metaphorically. -GHS
That is the difference between the mediocre and the prodigious.
That's the extent to which Miki has disciplined herself to survive until the last.
//More reminders of Youko and parallels with the ways she is wrong. -GHS
It all comes down to one word: admiration.
//HACK disable darkening -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, here we have our parting."

[Miki]
"......"

She does not release the hand.

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"Ah, uhmmm, welll."

[Taichi]
"Still want to talk some more or something?"
//HACK less ecstatic Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes, the truth is..."

[Taichi]
"The truth is?"

[Miki]
"Welll, it's, ah, really..."

Stagnation.
I launch a lifeboat.

[Taichi]
"Come to think of it,"

[Miki]
"Yes?!"

Her face lights up.
She became strong, but still she was innocent.
//Strength does not mean losing innocence... -GHS

[Taichi]
"You saved Kiri on the rooftop, right?"

[Miki]
"Yah."

[Taichi]
"All that's good of me are my eyes, so I understood this."
//HACK sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"...huh?"

[Taichi]
"Those where not the motions of a calculating self-interested person."
//HACK actually do it. -GHS

Her eyes open wide.

[Taichi]
"I'll just leave it with that said."
//HACK no need -GHS

[Miki]
"............"
//This is proof of how badly she is lying to herself about herself. Miki thinks she's a reflexive egotist who doesn't care for anyone, and an insect clothed up as a person, but when push comes to shove, she helps whoever's in danger. Compare Miki saving Kiri with CCC3003, when Taichi saved Yutaka (not that he really needed saving, but...). Miki is lying to herself about herself as badly as Taichi is! That's why he's not reliable when he discusses his status as monster: because after all, it's not that Miki's all that ruthless herself. -GHS

She stood stock still as if she was struck by divine revelation.
//See CCA0021. Hello. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...live on, Miki, as you are now. You've gone to great lengths to protect yourself as you are after all."
//Don't let Cross Talks escape just because they're not net negatives for all involved: although Taichi is stupidly sincere with this, she can't but be hearing it as a complete indictment of her behavior. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I'm so looking forwards to you teasing a different me that lives waaay on ahead, Miki, as you become an aaawesome adult and an amazing woman."

[Miki]
"...eh, yes... because I'll become an aaawesome amazing woman..."

Her voice had become husky.

[Taichi]
"Good, just like that."
[Taichi]
"And then, here, the diary. Be sure to offer it to the inside of that hokora."

A slender, frail, feminine hands receives it.

[Miki]
"......yes."
//HACK out doll -GHS

I bend over, and one last kiss.
Quickly distancing.
//HACK fade doll now. -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Then well then, see you next week!"
//First part's been typically used by Miki. -GHS

That farewell I found suitable.
//Hapchew! Did I get a cold? -GHS
I decided, I'm gonna be cool.
With good manners I turn on my heels,
//See CCA0009C. And it loops... -GHS
and gentlemanly set on walking.
//HACK no doll now. -GHS

[Miki]
"...Senpai!"

Stop.
//HACK doll now, with the fade -GHS

[Miki]
"Thank you again! For all you have done! This week tooo!"

A farewell shouted like she were in a cheer squad, that makes my lips curl into a smile.

[Taichi]
"...right."

[Miki]
"See you! Next week!"

Hands shaking swiftly.
Yeppy yep.
//Nanaka now. -GHS
People who intend to live alone really gotta go all out.
But the way of holding oneself so precious is, at times, painful.
It's something of an extreme argument, but,
it's because if one tries to take their self-sacrifices back, they'll all become acts that can be said to have been merely performed for the sake of the self.
//Except, even with the loop, the past can't be taken back. The only way to make this work is for some future event to make these nothing but the expectable stumbling of an infant trying to learn to walk. This would still require Christian philosophy to really work. -GHS
Miki is unreasonably correct.
//...as long as he sticks to his erroneous assumption that the past can be changed. This is why he's wrong even when technically he's right. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oooh-huh."

And that was how we parted.
