Good, let's stay loyal to the source material.
//This an anime adaptation now...? -GHS
It went...
I was walking down the corridor to find Miki cleaning.
The tips of my fingers fired towards Miki's ass with the speed of lightning, but merely grazed and couldn't seize the substance.
But Miki had been slow up until now, enough that I could touch her as much I liked.
This is a most alarming problem, Headmaster!
However, a pupil growing in skill is something to be honestly happy about.
The day when she surpasses I, her mentor, grows near.
I see, speed of lightning to the ass then.
Though I have to say that the details of the circumstances in the diary aren't clear to me.
Well, I'm sure it's setting off a sex prank to give me some Sex Appeal Wohohoh (Showa Era expression).

[Taichi]
"Teh'ryaaa."

An dispirited fighting scream,
together with hands reaching out.

[Miki]
"!?!"

Miki's eyes gleam with a flash of light.
Jumble!
Four hands ended up in entangle.

[Miki]
"He-, he is inside the castle, he is inside the castle...!"
//This entire scene seems to be a style reference to period pieces, though not to a specific one that I can find. -GHS

Grindy, scrapey, grindy is our close struggle for supremacy.
//Kiri-giri-giri. See CCA0021. Hum, can't find a way to work 'fog' in without making it sound even sillier. *badum-tish* -GHS

[Taichi]
"Thine ass our fingertips just have to brush, doth give me thine understanding on this!"
//screw it *chug* -GHS

[Miki]
"I understand not nonsensical words of that sort, Miki here can understand them nooo〜t!"
//Random pseudo-olde speech. It's almost as good as engrish. Urge... to write... "understoodn't"... rising -GHS

[Taichi]
"At peace be ye. 'Tis is but a brushing graze, the substance itself I shan't grasp!"
//This seems to be a straightforwards Three Kingdoms reference. -GHS

[Miki]
"That is the most ununderstandable..."

Grind, struggle, grind, c'mon already...
//Drop in all the meanings! -GHS

[Taichi]
"This is a most alarming problem, Headmaster!"

Things remain progressless, so I abandon the arrangement.

[Miki]
"...headmaster???"

[Taichi]
"OK got it. I'm stopping."

I unfasten my hands.

[Miki]
"As ever, the manners of someone deranged."

She's on a very subtle guard.
She has grown to be a girl without vulnerabilities.

[Taichi]
"Your skill's improved din'nit."

[Miki]
"Well now, well now."

[Taichi]
"Once upon a time that arse had only ever received massages, but it seems to be already in the process of becoming something that cannot be touched so easily."
//Another literal-only use of 揉... except he IS also belaboring on her ass (NOTICE: random British in effect in this sentence). -GHS

[Miki]
"Well now, well now, well now."

[Taichi]
"However, a pupil growing in skill is something to be honestly happy about. The day when she surpasses I, her mentor, grows near."

Merely reading in monotone without interpreting its meaning.
//[Joke about translations omitted]. This continues the World is a Stage metaphor. Merely replicating what went before won't work. -GHS

[Miki]
"You've been blurting out odd things for a while now."

[Taichi]
"Don't mind it. I'm just someone who loves harmonie preetablie from the roots."
//Adapted same as CCA0007, see CCB2010 -GHS

[Miki]
"...sigh."

Appalled,
but soon a laugh slips out.
//or laughing with a drug, which also means to reminisce. Ah, that's why drugs make you dream? -GHS

[Miki]
"Seriously, like always."
[Miki]
"Even when it turned out juuust like this."

[Taichi]
"So it seems, yeah."
[Taichi]
"No bodies, nothing, a very literal disappearance act."
[Taichi]
"It just doesn't feel real."

[Miki]
"So true."

[Taichi]
"Haven't seen dogs or cats, haven't heard the cries of the cicadas either."
[Taichi]
"If the microorganisms inside the human bodies were gone, wouldn't it be really bad?"

[Miki]
"But shouldn't they be safe inside the body?"
//She's given the Settei more thought than he did... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right you are."

[Miki]
"But maybe there's something just reallly off in this situation."

[Taichi]
"For example?"

[Miki]
"Hmmm."

Miki meets her hands at her chin as if praying, and thinks.
//Since Buddhists tend to make their hands come together with their elbows flat at a 90* angle, this gesture is suspiciously Christian. -GHS
That was kyuuute.

[Taichi]
"Nice gesture that."
//And therefore, SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Miki]
"Thanks. For example... we could be dreaming."

[Taichi]
"The 'it was all a dream' ending, yes."

That'd be depressing.
//Not as much as "it was truly science fiction all along". -GHS

[Miki]
"That would be depressing."

Oooh, a kindred soul!

[Taichi]
"The lack of sense of reality is indeed indicative of a dream, however,"
//Or of a sort-of hallucination... -GHS
[Taichi]
"I predict the following:"
//See CCC0020 -GHS
[Taichi]
"The FS Phenomenon!"
//See CCZDXC -GHS

[Miki]
"...Flying... s, sha... shi..."
//Shine. Congratulations on changing the publisher name to Cross Channel for the Reprint which completely screws up this line, though I guess if readers got this far and haven't even guessed most of what's happened so far, it's hopeless. -GHS
[Miki]
"Sherbet, is it?"

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Miki]
"Flying... shi... scha..."
[Miki]
"Schale!"

[Taichi]
"A petri dish flying in the sky. Unfortunately, you fail."
//I know, but IMO it's funnier this way. -GHS

[Miki]
"Flyin〜ng... shi... she..."
[Miki]
"Sherlockian!"

[Taichi]
"Holmes then. That guy learned the Japanese Style of Baritsu Wrestling that even I must admit to be an amazing form of unarmed combat."
//Technically it's BarTitsu, as Holmes' Baritsu is a likely a misspelling of that (though the forms have nothing to do with each other). Except... -GHS

[Miki]
"...was it even real that one."

[Taichi]
"It forms a matchless pair together with Karade."
//...Karade->KaraTe, Baritsu->BarTitsu. That's all. -GHS

[Miki]
"But I've never ever heard of either at all."

[Taichi]
"Because they're meta-arts."

[Miki]
"???"

[Taichi]
"They're only capable of defeating opponents that meet certain requirements."

[Miki]
"...they're garbage martial arts aren't they."

[Taichi]
"Take the game seriously, follow it to its logical conclusion and you will end up in the meta!"
//See, occifer? It taunted me! -GHS

I started heating up.
//See CCC3012B, CCC3019A -GHS

[Miki]
"Is that what it is then..."

[Taichi]
"The specific adversary is one of absurdly powerful Mecha-Strength!"
//Lateral meaning + literal term for lawls -GHS

And there have been many sightings of biological entities that do not exist on this Earth, too.
//Sightings/evidence of suspicious creatures, rather uncommon usage. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Miki's Karade has reached grandmaster levels too!"

[Miki]
"You mean what you've been always drilling into me is that martial art of meaning incomprehensible you call Karade?!"
//Someone's not resetting... -GHS

[Taichi]
"That 'meaning incomprehensible' was most uncalled for!"
//No denial, though. -GHS

[Miki]
"...I have received a shock."
//Seems to work better stock -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

[Miki]
"Flying Shy!"

Sudden return to previous conversation.

[Taichi]
"A particularly shy person flying in the sky. It'd be really ridiculous if someone were to draw that."
//Paraphrasis: COUGH COUGH WHAR FANART COUGH COUGH. -GHS

[Miki]
"So, in the end, what's the FS Phenomenon?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, it was the SF Phenomenon. My mistake."
//And that's part of why SF must be kept like this. Part. -GHS

[Miki]
"............"

She made a facial expression as if completely and thoroughly outsmarted, that is hard to attach adjectives to.

[Taichi]
"It's a somewhat freaky phenomenon, so to say..."
//Sukoshi Fushigi. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, whatever then. I understood it at that moment."
//Uncertain, of course, if she's speaking of when he first spoke, of when he said Somewhat Freaky/Sukoshi Fushigi, or who knows how long ago when they had this conversation already. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you, did...?"

[Miki]
"In other words 'dunnooo', that's what it means."
//Poor Miki doesn't get that it requires following the VN to get to the metaelements... it's why she can't win in the end. Or part of it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Science is powerless innit."
[Taichi]
"And with that said, it's signing time."
[Taichi]
"Love Prince Stamp Signature Collection. How many has Miki-Miki collected I wonder?"
//Hum, not Princess Stamp? Wait a sec, this doesn't mean that it was Love Aristocrat all along and the nickname just kept changing and they forgot to change these, right? But possibly, just like the MateBook's origin, it changing name is an in-joke between them. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes, this is Miki-Miki. It has been a while since the last reception of a signature."

[Taichi]
"It was Summer Vacation after all."
//しね! -GHS

I was given a booklet.
It's the Matebook.
The book taking its name from the famous Soapland "Matebook" in which the first-generation school Headmaster achieved enlightenment via excessive pleasure is nothing but a lie.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapland see also CCD0001. Uhm, the book taking its name from a soapland is a lie, not the book itself. Though the placement at the end is the joke. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

The booklet is buried in my scribbles.
I jot down a new signature in a fresh blank page.

[Taichi]
"Collect 20 of them and you'll have an amazing service!"

[Miki]
"...it's totally a sexual prank!"

[Taichi]
"Hm, did you say something?"

[Miki]
"I did not."

[Taichi]
"Well then, with this one I met my quota."
//AKA "script complete". Hey, look at that RET command: -GHS
