[Taichi]
"That son was, of course, Yutaka."
//HACK flashback exit whiteout, fade BG instead of pixelating in. -GHS

[Kiri]
"............"

Kiri was unable to react.
The shaking of her hands stopped.
Calming down... was not the cause.
Terror in her facial expression, she looks at me.
She hadn't noticed that the tip of the bolt had strayed from me.
//Arrow + butt = tip of the bolt. I don't actually know if it's called an arrowhead regardless. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And, as you maybe have guessed, 'S' is also the initial of Shinkawa."
//HACK fade the doll instead of popping in -GHS

[Kiri]
"...wh-, what did you say...?"

Half smile.
She is unable to keep even emotions under control.

[Taichi]
"Guy's a child, but he's well acquainted with that stuff. I thought he'd never be able to have a proper life anymore."
[Taichi]
"He'd end up as a pervert or maybe a junkie."

[Kiri]
"YOU LIE!!!"

Piercing loud scream.

[Kiri]
"You lie, you lie you LIE YOU LIE!!! Don't lie to me! Did you lose your mind?! You're just spreading garbage..."

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."

Once again Kiri's hands began shaking.

[Kiri]
"That simply can't be! It's simply impossible that Yutaka would ever do anything like that!"

[Taichi]
"That simply is. Yutaka did all that."
[Taichi]
"And he was the most enthusiastic!"

I laugh.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, and he was a kid, so raping adult females has gotta have been harsh. To a child, those privates would a big shock that's---"
//強姦 -GHS

[Kiri]
"SILENCE!!!"

Her voice seems to be bursting open.

[Kiri]
"I have never heard about this anywhere! We've always lived together, and he never talked about that. Impossible... unthinkable---"
//Already from the voice it's obvious she suspects. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Memory loss."
//HACK actually do it. -GHS

Kiri's lips closed tight on the spot.
It felt she had become a detective, and a great one.

[Taichi]
"So you have unraveled the mystery, Kiri-chin."
//He's still being an ass. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...that is... he has no memories of it and..."

[Taichi]
"And, I know why that guy's leg is injured."

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Because I was there."

[Kiri]
"...then... Senpai... you knew he...?"

[Taichi]
"Nyope."
//Fukuoka-ben. Cats will be fine, too. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I never thought that Yutaka would still be around... I forgot the very name Yutaka."
//MEMORY HUNTER! Yutaka came to Kamisaka when Taichi was halfway through his first year, around one or two years after Taichi did. Utterly ridiculous he'd have forgotten the guy who had spearheaded his torture for weeks, perhaps months, and that he thought he had killed so ferociously. Of course, see CCA0011C: like hell he's forgotten. This is a hint that while Taichi remembers, he doesn't necessarily Remember. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...meeting him was a coincidence."
//Of the same kind that'll be seen in Miki's route. This is pure Providence. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I had been put into girls' clothing so... looks like there wasn't any recognizing from him either."

For all that, Yutaka had survived.
//Readers still don't know Yutaka should've died. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So well, lots of complications and I was set free... there were lots of twists and turns and I ended up here."
[Taichi]
"Thinking back, it's just natural, isn't it."
[Taichi]
"There was no way that that wouldn't break our spirits, nor for me nor for Yutaka."
[Taichi]
"I wonder if us meeting was just inevitable."

[Kiri]
"...but he's... not that cruel a person... I'll never believe this!"
//Going by how she treats in CCC3004, it's possible that she figured out exactly what kind of person he was, whether she accepted it or not. Then again, she's not the smartest or hardest to convince. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I recognized Yutaka after we got close."

[Kiri]
"...that's why... you murdered him?"

Well, seems deceptions won't work anymore.
I, too, just wanted to spit it out.
//This reads as if he wants to just state outright his hatred for him... -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's not like I immediately fired into some murderous rage."
//...but he doesn't. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It was just a thing of the past."
//It's both true and false. -GHS

[Kiri]
"But then...!"

The flow began to reverse.
//Pshaw, this requires at least seventeen more twists, none of which make any sense (though some of which are certainly awesome). -GHS
The wave of her swelling emotions had broken ashore, drenched me, and is now withdrawing.
Kiri...
She had gone on the attack because that is her way.

[Taichi]
"I thought, if he's in pain, I'll let it go."
//See CCC3007, it's possible he was already aware then. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But when he was hanging around with me, he seemed to be happy."

[Kiri]
"...!!!"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS
[Kiri]
"That day... you asked me... was he happy...?"

[Taichi]
"You remember that, good."
[Taichi]
"That's right. That was what it meant."

And now, once again, I throw the same question at her.

[Taichi]
"Say, Kiri, I'm wondering... was Yutaka happy?"

An usual question to ask,
but,
the meaning was wholly and damnably the opposite.

[Kiri]
"...he was feeling bitter!"
[Kiri]
"His relatives were so cruel... so rough..."
//Possibly referring to how they looked relieved at the funeral... possibly referring to the story in CCC3025. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Truly, always, bitter?"
[Taichi]
"There were never times of happiness, not even one instant?"

[Kiri]
"Well..."

[Taichi]
"I'm sure there were."

Kiri doesn't answer. And hangs her head.
The weapon points down as well.
Hostility and murderous intent too wither. A wilted flower.
//SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
Her thin slender body fills with a toxin named doubt.
//What toxin, this is a well needed medicine! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sooo, well, yeah, that's that. All the stuff he's done long ago is all beautifully and spotlessly forgotten, and his heart is all clean and refreshed. How so very happy could he become after that!"
//This is why forgetting's not removing the past, and why Taichi's attempt to have his way with the time loop can't work. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And that is why I made him remember."
//HACK sweatdrop Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...stop this..."
//See CCD5001. It's not word for word, but it might as well be. And in both cases it's something they need to hear. -GHS

Kiri goes to cover her ears.

[Taichi]
"Don't cover your ears!"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Hands stop.

[Taichi]
"It was a nice clear sunny day."
[Taichi]
"As you did see, that moment we talked about everything."

[Kiri]
"...ngh..."

[Taichi]
"And then he asked: how can I make you forgive me?"
[Taichi]
"There's no forgiving nor condemning. Sins perpetrated remain like that in eternity. There's no putting your hands on them in any way. Neither there is changing them. I didn't feel like there was blame then."
//And... -GHS
[Taichi]
"...just, there was one thing unclear."
[Taichi]
"So I asked him a question:"
[Taichi]
"Say, I got one question though... why don't you just die right this very instant?"
//This is one of the cornerstones of Cross Channel. The better question is: how come Yutaka didn't have another answer? -GHS
[Taichi]
"...that was what I asked."
//Hypertritlerasdpoxcvds e he wore incredibly varnished clothes from The Gap and a star in her hair and as she monologued for a two hours she ended up, what are your names? -GHS

[Kiri]
"Aaahhh..."

[Taichi]
"And then... that guy killed himself for real."

Kiri crumbled down.
She squats cradling her knees on the spot.
A smile of pity engraves on my face.
//But is it an insincere one? -GHS

[Taichi]
"However things may go, the truth is only one:"

Just one more try, one more push, and she'll shatter.
//See CCA0026B. Since he's about to do a great big favor to her, I suspect this is intentional. Kiri's no more going to shatter than Misato is going to reject Taichi (provided he does it the way she wants it, i.e. giving her plausible deniability). -GHS
And I know that, but still,
I whisper in her ears,
so as to stab her with the blade of a weapon with a real edge.
//Because of the vagaries of Kiri's knife etc., this will return in CCX0001. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your nii-san was a filthy, rotten, disgusting rapist fuck."
//"Rapist monkey" or "rapist chimp" sound a tad too silly, though it connects to how Touko calls him a monkey in heat. Outside of that it's not used literally anyway, and as I can't think of an animal that wouldn't sort of blunt this (like 'dog'), I fucking need to fucking go with another fucking swearword, mother of all shitfuck. -GHShitfuck

[Kiri]
"..............."

Snap.
And so I knew that a string inside Kiri had been cut,
and may never be reconnected again.
//The one that binds her to Yutaka. This is a GOOD THING FOR HER. -GHS
