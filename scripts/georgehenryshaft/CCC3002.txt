Kiri went red in the face.

[Taichi]
"What is even next now."

[Miki]
"That is obvious."
[Miki]
"I have said to remove your belows."
//See CCC0026 -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"You sure?"

So I proclaim with seriousness.

[Taichi]
"That means to expose 'this' to the public, do you know that?"
//HACK later BG, with Miki doll already in -GHS

[Miki]
"Making threats at this late stage, are you?"
//Watch Miki take Taichi's crap even more seriously than HE does. If there were a metachuuni Settei working throughout, this is evidence she'd not only follow it, but be perfectly incapable of telling whether others are serious or not. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Fool! You fail to comprehend how scary this thing is!"
[Taichi]
"You think it's like that crossbow, some sweet little thing that even a beginner can easily control?"
//That's, of course, kinda laughable. Sure, it's easier than a bow, but it's not that trivial. -GHS
[Taichi]
"All throughout the world, endlessly will it greedily devour those membranes we call hymens, those girls we call virgins... it is truly a demon."
//The implication remains that Taichi's Monster is and has always been his sex drive. -GHS
[Taichi]
"If it is released but once, the disappearance of the dazzling radiance of virgin girls from the world is a certainty."

[Miki]
"...meaningless whining."

[Kiri]
"Say... I don't really want to see it either..."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin will be silent."

[Kiri]
"...oh, 'K."

She's downhearted.
Miki is serious.

[Taichi]
"...do you intend to return everything to nothing?"
//See CCB0022 -GHS

[Miki]
"What if I say I do?"

[Taichi]
"But! You... the person you are... you are still a scientist!"
//Doesn't seem so much a reference, as much as a masquerading of the simpler truth: Miki plays the "villain" by pushing her Dragon, Kiri, on Taichi because stories demand villains and their sidekicks. So Kiri is made to look like the villain, but she's just a manipulated puppet, and the true villain was the protagonist's pupil who turned to evil. This is all metagame within metagame. And then the true villain was coincidence, and coincidence was no villain but God. The End - Cross Channel. -GHS

[Miki]
"Science is thorough investigation to its inevitable conclusion. Science is the progress through and beyond the taboos."
//No it isn't, and no it isn't. Miki's a mad scientist, though, certainly. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I can't see what you're talking about at all..."
//"Seeing" is important, of course. See Shimura Phenomenon: when Miki can't see... -GHS

[Miki]
"Science performed while looking backwards is meaningless, Professor."

[Taichi]
"Ngh, did you sell your soul to the devil?"

[Miki]
"Indeed, just like Einstein."
//Robert Johnson. ...I actually thought that up as a stupid joke, but see CCA0008: this is the simplest explanation for why Taichi would call Miki with the name 'Johnson'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Can't avoid this..."

I touched a nipple.
//The second will come into play later. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then I will use this Self-Destruct Button!"
//See CCA0008, same term as his sexual molestation technique. -GHS

[Kiri]
"............"

Kiri put away the crossbow and went into the toilet.
//Since it fits into her pocket anyway. -GHS

[Miki]
"Self-Destruct Button?"
//Wonder if she thinks he's about to assault her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed. For I absolutely cannot let this... this mephistophelic masterpiece loose onto the world!"

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Be all at peace, ladies. My wife, my son, sorry... forgive your stupid father!"
//HACK stop music and wait for 1.5" -GHS
[Taichi]
"...hm?"
[Taichi]
"What is the meaning of this? Why doesn't the Device work?"
//HACK restart music -GHS

[Miki]
"...heheh, I have seen through all your actions and behaviors long ago, Your Highness!"

[Kiri]
"The cast has changed..."

Returning from the toilet, Kiri sluggishly readjusted her crossbow posture.

[Taichi]
"The wiring... dammit! The hell is this!"
//Wiring's not his specialty after all, see CCA0006. See CCB0022 again. Combine with Tower of Friends and... -GHS

[Miki]
"It is inescapable doom."
//On random and very much likely unrelated news, the Zettai Zetsumei Toshi series is 2002 at least... damn I really thought it was older. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Heh..."
[Taichi]
"Did you forget now, that there are TWO nipples!"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Miki]
"?!?"

[Taichi]
"Wallowing in your science, ergonomics caught you off-guard... Miki-kun, this is how you are beat!"
//The subtext should be making your head spin right about here, especially considering she just goes and tries to kill him over this very comment. -GHS

[Miki]
"'Cause I'll let ya!"
//Hmmm. -GHS

Miki jumped on Kiri.
//And zero fanfictions were born. Boo! -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh!, what are...!?"

On my forehead, a small warning signal goes off.
//See CCC0006A, CCC4010 -GHS
At once Kiri shifts the point of attack.
CIN 4 480 0 0 0
CR 0
//HACK in the bolt. The hardcoded speed for displaying the CG coming in from the side of the screen is waaay too slow, but this nice command fits the bill. -GHS
A bolt is fired.
//HACK out bolt with a white flash. SFX is later, dunno why but it's so in all console versions. -GHS

[Taichi]
"!!!!!!"

As expectable, even if seeing it is possible, reacting is not.
It grazed the side of my cheek.

[Taichi]
"......"

I look behind and see it stuck on the wall of the corridor.

[Taichi]
"............"
[Taichi]
"EarMikiEar..."
//Mimi-Mimi + Mi-Mi-Mi-Mi[-Miki] -GHS

[Miki]
"Apologies, Professor!"

[Taichi]
"Don't 'professor' me! Super dangerous! That now was super dangerous!"

[Miki]
"...ehahah."

[Taichi]
"Don't you 'ehahah' meee!"

Whoa, cold sweat came out behind schedule!
//see CCC4006 -GHS

[Taichi]
"I-, I thought I would die..."

[Miki]
"I'm sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm still alive so I guess it's fine."
[Taichi]
"Isn't it, Kiri-chin?"

[Kiri]
"Eh, ah, huh..."

Kiri was overcome by surprise.

[Taichi]
"But are there nooo words of apology from Kiri-chin then?"

[Kiri]
"...eh."

[Taichi]
"But I nearly lost my life didn't I, that just caaan't end with saying it was a joke can it!"

[Kiri]
"...that is..."

[Taichi]
"That is...?"

[Kiri]
"............"
//Miki reacting to the next line not added. -GHS

I can understand her conflict.

[Taichi]
"An apology, right?"
//Continuation of the "that's" -GHS

[Kiri]
"......ngh..."

She's nearly crying.
That's how much she doesn't want to, then.

[Taichi]
"The apology?"

Kiri" "......so-... sorr---"
The instant she tried to push out the words,
I felt an extreme desire for a reset.
//To save her from embarrassment... though as usual in their cross-conversation, he does so by making himself look even worse in her eyes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Knew it, ain't happening. I'm getting a Seal of Apology on my own accord then."
//HACK Miki shocked, Kiri sweatdrop -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh..."

[Taichi]
"T'eyaaah!"
//VERTICAL STRIPE SHIMAPAN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-GHS

Outspokehhh!
//明け透け. -GHS
That's the onomatopoeia that was audible.
//See CCB2007. Same issue. -GHS

[Kiri]
"!!!???"
[Kiri]
"Wh-, what? Wha-what?"

[Taichi]
"Did you see it now!"
//How Taichi is wearing pants despite him being in his underwear until moments ago? Yeah, I do. This one I think is just a plot hole. -GHS
[Taichi]
"This is Extreme of Skirt Flipping: the Parachute Death Sentence!"
[Taichi]
"On access to the skirt, that 1 instant in which the fingertips clench the cloth, I make 24 joints simultaneously operate so that inside the ravishing sealed space of the lower portions of a girl's body outbreaks a turbulence most minute."
//Sealed space = recurring term. Not certain what is meant with that joints things, there's 28 joints total on the hand, so which 4 are missing? 2+4=6,+1 (the 1 instant the operation takes) =7. Forced... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Via this act, the flipped skirt is maintained into the state of a parachute, and via an estimated flight duration many times that of an everyday skirt flip, most assuredly exposes the underwear to the public's attention!"

[Miki]
"...Senpai's not a person, really."
//This'll be nearly Kiri's catchphrase around Taichi. See CCA0027. -GHS

[Taichi]
"However, via this endlessly long Nuditeh time the degree of bashfulness swells by leaps and bounds, that when the perduration of the Parachute Effect enters its demise, it assuredly also signifies a Sentence of Death with regards to my life!"
//Sekirara, see CCB2007 again. Line was actually split exactly here in the console version -GHS
[Taichi]
"It is a bold move that expends life, ergo its name: Parachute Death Sentence!"

[Miki]
"...that's a biggie even for you, pervert-san."
//See CCC4012. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Wh-, why doesn't it go down... eh, eh, eh?!"
//modoraNA...na / na na -GHS

In a flap Kiri flaps her skirt down,
but the side opposite of her flapping flips fluffily higher.
//I have avoided "flips fluffily further up". Be glad. -GHS
But even if she were to leave it be, the medusiform skirt would continue to expose her underwear.
Exactly as if from the lower parts a wind were blowing upwards.

[Taichi]
"Have counterintelligence measures. There is no certainty that those who have been allies thus far will be allies hereafter."
//Even though he's telling Kiri not to trust Miki, it doesn't really fit. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Make good use of this lesson, Kiri-chin!"

[Kiri]
"Sk-, the skiiirt... floating all fluffy! Really, what is this?!"
//It's FUCKING FUWA FUWA TIME it's what it is. -GHS

[Miki]
"Amazing trick isn't it..."

[Taichi]
"Lovely, innit, Kiri-chin."

I stick my thumb up.

[Kiri]
"AaAaAaaaAaaaah..."
//7x2 As total -GHS

Kiri-chin was in a feverish haste.
If there was real public presence, she could mayhap even experience death in agony.
So is expected from Esoterica.
Youko-chan for example wouldn't be moved at all wouldn't she.
Indeed, a skirt flip needs to send in a flap.
//No, not planning to stop. -GHS
Eventually, slowly, the skirt returns down.

[Kiri]
"...hah... haaah..."

She broke into some really nasty sweat.

[Taichi]
"To bring a Parachute Death Sentence into existence, the time taken is a mere 0.05" and no more. Therefore, let us now see the process for ourselves one more t---"
//See CCA0006 and CCB2015 - that's 2x faster than Taichi's intercranial Ph*tosh*p and as fast as the summoning of the Harakiri Blade! Hmmm, 5+2 (the times he tries to go and do them) =7? OK, too forced. -GHS

I had laid my hands on Kiri-chin's skirt and,
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Kiri]
"CH'EYAAAAAAAAAAA!!!"
//See CCB0006 (but not quite) -GHS

[Miki]
"First time in so long we've seen her foot techniiiiique!"

[Taichi]
"G'hyaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
//Hmmm, don't see it in either of these. -GHS

The dropped heel instills endlessly changing trajectories left and right as they please.
It was definitely the turbulence of the kick.
//Same term as PDS -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oooooooh..."
//おx7, still -GHS

[Kiri]
"You are abnormal!!!"

Treated as one abnormal.

[Taichi]
"OwChCh..."

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki!"

She's in a real huff of a mood.

[Taichi]
"...aaah, ah, she's gone."
//HACK Miki doll fades in instead of popping. -GHS

[Miki]
"Your spirit of self-challenge is admirable, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Indeed. Humans don't know the moment of their death."
[Taichi]
"Well, you guys should live at ease and carefree too."

[Miki]
"'essir."
[Miki]
"Still... you get along bad, you two."

Reciprocal bitter smiles.

[Taichi]
"Because me and Kiri are Worthy Rivals of Love over you, Miki-Miki."
//好敵手 -GHS

[Miki]
"That's right, yes. Really worthy rivals for sure."
//She's using Kiri as the Dragon. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

She said that very casually.

[Kiri]
"Miki!"

[Miki]
"Yeeeesh. Well, Senpai, someday someday see you again!"
//いつか、わたし -GHS

I return a merry greeting.
Miki ran over then lined up with Kiri.
