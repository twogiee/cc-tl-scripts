[Touko]
"...'lling you!"
//[I'm te] -GHS

Yelled at right in the ears, I come to my senses.

[Taichi]
"Ye-, yes?"

[Touko]
"All spacing out. Ignoring me. That hurts!"

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm."
[Taichi]
"Don't I even have the privilege of spacing out now?"

[Touko]
"...were you thinking about Miyasumi-senpai maybe."

[Taichi]
"I was thinking about a guy."

[Touko]
"?!?!?"

Touko was engulfed in shock (visual impression).

[Touko]
"A guy... but no... that's so... (blushing)"
//SHE'S INTO BL RUN -GHS

[Taichi]
"The hell's that!"

That was really mean.
And still it's not like it's all that strange.
//Her reaction and him thinking about a guy. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dreaming lady, don't be having too many dreams!"
//夢見る薬？ -GHS

[Touko]
"...well, since you three stooges always gave that impression, of course there's a bit of a dream."
//... -GHS

[Taichi]
"STOP!"

That's revolting.
//Contrast with CCA0018B, i.e. the script that's just ended. -GHS
A Pure Love Story with one of those two, really!

[Taichi]

[Taichi]
"Whyyy are you thinking stuff that creeepy, it's just friendship, just friendship, it's all normal!"
//See CCA0013. Taichi dreamed it was possibly in response to creepy stuff he wrote about Touko, as well. -GHS

[Touko]
"That's not disgusting! At least, as far as outwards you three stooges can be looked at."
//...shouldn't this mean "that's what you three stooges look like [gay]?" But below... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...don't you include me."

[Touko]
"Oh no, are you still playing ugly duckling?"
//Oono? Ohho? Onno. Onna noh mask. -desu -GHS

[Taichi]
"Shaddep!"

This is a serious problem!
My self-deprecating routine is there to cover for it somehow.
//Best explained in the ending. ...not that Taichi gets it himself... -GHS
Sure... this might not be a problem of looks at all but...
I can understand that as much as I like, but completely changing one's way of thinking is not so simple.
Because,
because, well...

[Taichi]
"So anyway."
//And cuts to perversion, i.e., no change. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Punishment for having disgusting thoughts!"

[Touko]
"Eh?"

Nuditehhh!
//赤裸々 -GHS
That's the onomatopoeia that was audible from someplace.
//Since there's serious possibilities that Taichi is having auditory hallucinations, and this is almost certainly one of them regardless, can't specify more. -GHS

[Touko]
"...!!!!!"

[Taichi]
"Annnd UP!"

I seize the hem of the skirt, and affix it to her head.
//I think they sell glue in Japan for that -GHS
Now, the shaming of Touko is at levels incomparable!
And in public as well.
So, what shall you do Touko!
Oh Samurai Girl of the True Blade, what will you doooooooo...! (next episode preview-like)
As a matter of fact,
I was prepared to get beaten, anticipated it even.
But despite that,

[Touko]
"............"

I am but stared at by reproachful eyes.
Her face dyes a light vermilion, that's it.
Holding down her hand as if in apology, there is no serious volition of guarding her Scanties.
//http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3 http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scanties -GHS
But very much all of her frankness is visible.

[Taichi]
"How... come... not... angry?"

[Touko]
"...but... there's no one looking..."
//See CCD2002. Does she think that a good thing, or a bad one? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tha-!"

My lips tremble.

[Taichi]
"That's not true you know?!"

[Touko]
"Why would a skirt flip make me angry now?"

[Taichi]
"Shouldn't there have been a 'dun-dun-dunnn' there?"
//May have termed the inversions. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Well, show me some your techniques!"

[Touko]
"...let it go, I can't walk."
[Touko]
"And it's... embarrassing."

Flush!

[Taichi]
"Flushed..."
[Taichi]
"That's it?"

Bob and the girl gives a nod.
Alas.
//Just bein' pretentious, really. -GHS
Nietzsche had said it:
//See CCA0015C -GHS
"Touko is dead."
//This line is so not funny on the second time through. -GHS
Nay.
Touko, the individual, has not died.
In the analysis of Touko's character, the
quarrelsome, unyielding spirit that acts as an
enormous maximum common denominator for her values
had now been forcefully removed from her.
Meaning one part of Touko's personality has died.
Touko became completely realistic. Again.
//Hint hint. -GHS
But me, I like the Touko that is always
irritably edgy.
Because that's the most equilibrated.
Well, if it has to be like this---

[Taichi]
"Time for Forbidden Esoterica!"
//See CCA0022 -GHS

[Touko]
"Lemme go alreadyyy... it's all breezy and it won't stop."
//See CCA0015B -GHS

[Taichi]
"I will make it more breezy-breezy. Otherwise it's impossible for me to take off the panties or make you wear a sanitary napkin!"
//STILL on about her being on her period. -GHS

[Touko]
"...wait, you can't exactly yank them off when I'm like this---"

[Taichi]
"T'hyah!"

And then,
I unleashed the forbidden move.
The underwear down slides.
Until the ankle.
Hurry up, mosaic censoring! Quick, quick!
Hoh, it already took. As typical, it works so fast!
It's a question of life and death, isn't it!

[Taichi]
"Ah, Touko! C'est si bon! (so very good!) C'est si bon! (so very good!)"
//Added some random French for--- no, wait, this one wasn't me. -GHS

Freely using most skilled French, I present great admiration to Touko's genitalia.

[Touko]
"..."
[Touko]
"............"
[Touko]
"'llyyyyyy!!!"

She's saying "reallyyy",
so that had to have been her lisp.
//Technically it's identical, but the original line doesn't have the kanji in 'tarazu'. -GHS
It's easily understood when kissing:
suck a bit on her lip, and she flounders as if drowning, up, up, up.
//アップアップ sometimes the Japanese have an actually clever sense of humor. -GHS
But on the other hand, the insides of her mouth have the heat of a furnace.
Her tongue too has the softness of cream. It's an intoxicating flavor.
My memories run to my lovellatious days with Touko.
* Lovellatio = Taichian for caresses of all types to lips
  in general... maybe. Origin unknown. Seems to be
  love + fellatio.
And,

[Touko]
"SCAPONTAAAAAAAAAAANNNN!!!"
//Time Bokan reference. http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/%A5%B9%A5%AB%A5%DD%A5%F3%A5%BF%A5%F3 There doesn't seem to be an official translation for this, and the English transliterateing doesn't google either. I can't even find videos of this in either language. -GHS

Bokan!
//Well, why not. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Helpy heeeeeeeeelp!!!"
//Response to Scapontan? Without even a video... -GHS

As I was fluttering through the air, I thought,
about Shinkawa Yutaka, the man that was no more.
