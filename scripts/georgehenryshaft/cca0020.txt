I returned to the room and turned on the light.
So much had happened, therefore I was tired.
//I wonder if today's the day Yutaka died... -GHS

[Taichi]
"But damn it's hot."

I gotta get the air conditioning repaired quickly.
The ground floor living room has air conditioning, but I just can't settle down there.
//He wants privacy for his porn. Maybe. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Should I just take a cold bath."
//It's a flashback because he pretty much never does in the main story. -GHS

I decided to do so.

[Taichi]
"'wat...?"

The doorbell called back an awareness that had nearly left for the pleasant comfortableness of the other side.

[Taichi]
"No way."
//Though it's not exactly an uncommon wording, here it's sorta Yutaka's catchphrase. -GHS

I hurriedly get out and wipe myself down.
With a Kimono over me, I head to the entryway.

[Taichi]
"Cooo-ming!"
[Taichi]
"Who might it be?"

[Yusa]
"Ah, uhm, it's Doujima!"

[Taichi]
"A gangster-like surname associated with a conversely kyute voice... Yusa-chan? It's open, do come in!"
//see CCA0013 -GHS

Slowly and carefully the door opens, and there stood a beautiful girl.

[Yusa]
"Hello, good eve... ning."

Her pupils go wide.
The reflection of my figure on her deep dark pupils.
//See CCA0001 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Good evening."
//HACK normal Yusa -GHS

[Yusa]
"A Kimono... yes it is."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, this? Astonished?"

[Yusa]
"Surprised, yes..."
//Not quite the same acceptation. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's because I like dem Soseki."
//See CCA0019 for the pun. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"And it feels very good on me."
//Cooough. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Uhm, it suits you."
//Coooough. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Yusa]
"Well, the hair is indeed giving it some white and... it suits you, I think."

[Taichi]
"But still, dark hair is the best with a kimono."
//I wonder if that was the hair he used to have. I suspect it was the same color as the Youko wig he has. -GHS

Rise a bitter smile to the surface.
//Imperative and specific, remember he molds smiles. This is pure resentment. If Yutaka isn't dead, he's about to die. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't it'd fit you a lot better, Yusa-chan?"

[Yusa]
"B-, but it's... hic!"
//And there it goes, right on cue. -GHS

On the downbeat of her raising her voice, out came a hiccup.
//See CCA0013, exact same term. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Hic! ...hic! ...hic!"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh my my."

[Yusa]
"Hic!... sorry, hic!..."
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"Doesn't look like it's gonna stop."

But it should be fine if I give are fright, right.
If this was Kirihara, I'd just jerk open the front of the kimono without a second thought, but,
//Meaning he's holding himself back. But is that what he should be doing, really? -GHS
to scare this girl, well...

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."
[Taichi]
"Yusa-chan, look at me."

[Yusa]
"Hic?"

The head of the pretty girl looks up to my approaching face.
I draw near to five centimeters of distance, and whisper:
//See CCA0030. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's get married."
//I suspect she takes this seriously. I admit, part of the evidence is how Umineko handled this, and by that I mean committed one of the most grandiose crimes against writing, but think about it: her Ultramarine/Split Personality/True Persona calms down after this. -GHS

[Yusa]
"!!!!!!?!?!?!?!"
//Hmmm, just 6? -GHS
HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Yusa-chan froze.
For about one minute, there was not the faintest of stirs.
//That's... ouch. This is more than a little shock. -GHS
The hiccups stopped.

[Yusa]
"Ah, uhm, now?"
//And... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, first of all come inside."

[Yusa]
"But, now?"

[Taichi]
"Please, make yourself at home!"

[Yusa]
"...now, what just happened now...?"
//...something wrong has happened. Did this event happen? Did she get replaced for a moment? Did her Real Self come up? Harder to answer. -GHS

I let her sit, and lay out some barley tea.
//So he DOES have tea in the house. -GHS

[Yusa]
"And the people at home?"

[Taichi]
"Don't think she's gonna be coming back, tonight at least."

[Yusa]
"Eh?"

A complicated expression rises to the surface.
//Same term as his more than a little suspicious one above, not imperative of course. See CCC4012, hmmm. -GHS
She guesses complicated circumstances, no mistake.
//She probably guesses his host family isn't his actual family. -GHS
But truth is, they are more or less complicated.

[Taichi]
"It's that she always keeps staying at the company dormitory when she's busy with work."

[Yusa]
"Ahhh, that is what..."

[Taichi]
"So, what thrilling news may you be bringing me bring here on this day?"

[Yusa]
"That's so very much how a character from some foreign novel talks."
//Told you some of this stuff should sound backtranslated. -GHS
[Yusa]
"Uhm, it's that today would be my birthday."
//This seems cut from two very different parts of a take, or two takes. Unfortunately, there's been no pickups for Yusa (she has not a single line in After Story either), so this is still like this as far as the 360 version. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, it was, right."

I didn't know.
That was sloppy, Taichi-kun.

[Yusa]
"So then, here... a birthday present!"
//That doesn't happen even in Japan as far as I can see. But is she scared of him so much he can't even ask him for the diary back without somehow appeasing him, or is this just what her mother taught him? -GHS

I unconsciously accept a something packed inside wrapping paper as "?" fill the inside my head.
//fucking metal gears -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm... first of all, thank you. But, uh...?"

A birthday present, she said?

[Yusa]
"A little gratitude for always taking care of me."

Certainly, I'm taking care of her quite proactively.
Or should I say, I'm trying to make her fall for me. Experimentally.
//See CCD2002. It's no more an experiment here than it is there. -GHS
Because, I thought, if she received gentle attention from the time of youth, then that 'minus' that is my appearance could be mitigated.
//OTOH, this is closer to what he really thinks his problem is. -GHS
The Super Was Hikari Genji Truly All Satisfied Smiles Experiment, as I call my plan, has presently assembled sufficient data to produce a judgment of 'favorable'.
//See CCA0013. -GHS
As to how I hadn't given much thought what to do after a success, I realized it just now.
//What does a dog do after it's caught a car? -GHS

[Yusa]
"And also, I thought, so I could hand in the exchange diary tomorrow..."

She rocks back and forth above her lap fingers that don't wish to readily settle down.
She bows, and all but the nape of the neck is completely red.
She looks like she's full, full to the brim.

[Taichi]
"Moe!"

[Yusa]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, it's all done! I'll go get it."

[Yusa]
"Ah, yes!"

I head upstairs.
The girl's diary, and...
I survey the room.
Something that I could present Yusa-chan...
You should've had a stuffed animal or something in you, dear my room so indifferent to the Marchen.
//http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/364221/Marchen -GHS
Anything but fairy-tales here.
CARNAL ONLY.
//Kannou even sounds sort-of like 'carnal' (written kaanaru). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Cut it out, cut it ooout!"

Let's try thinking about what I'd want if it were for me.
...Yusa-chan's just-stripped underpants...
The self's hand that with spontaneity goes to unfasten the kimono's belt is torn off via rationality and the iron will it possesses.
//Reminder that it's technically not his hand. Interesting he's going for HIS kimono, isn't it? Now look at CCD0021. Whose clothes is he taking off there? -GHS
What would I do if what was built up 'til this moment were to be cast towards the horizon in an instant?

[Taichi]
"Cut it out."

Something suitable for a birthday present. Is there nothing?

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

Nah, how could I use this.
It's way out of character.
If she awakens to this weird hobby I'm in trouble.
//SHE LISTENS TO RADIO BURN THE WITCH. This line hasn't made any damn sense for nearly ten years since the full identity of the present hasn't been revealed until the Xbox 360 version. The radio he's giving her has listening device capabilities, and of course there's otakus of that. See CCB0018, which used to be just a copypasta of this script until the console versions rewrote that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhhh-huh."

It does have that it's unpredictable, doesn't it.
Could it work?

[Taichi]
"Nnnaaa〜h."

And from downstairs,

[Yusa]
"Uhmmm, Taichi-saaan, it's that it is just about time and I just must head back..."

[Taichi]
"Ngh!"

Got no time for indecisiveness.
Search for manual and box, repackage, and cram into a paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Sorry for the wait!"

[Yusa]
"Ahh..."

The color of relief rises to the surface.
//It continues. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, first of all your exchange diary, and also, this is a birthday present from me."

[Yusa]
"......"

This young lady has the bad habit of losing words when surprised, don't she.
Explanations for the present are best left for some other time.
//It'll never come, according to CCB0018, so him attempting to push her down will likely come not days after this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's see you home."

[Yusa]
"............!!!?!?"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Her loss of words about doubles from before.
//This isn't moe; this is a girl who is utterly and honestly astonished at being treated as anything but worthless. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's night by now, and there's kinda dangerous people out there."
//That would seem extraordinarily unlikely, given the difficulty of access, but considering Gunjou... -GHS

And especially in this town, oh yes.
//...and this is a hint that that's what he means. And two of them are about to run about unsupervised at night. Great job, Japanese government. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Shall we go?"

[Yusa]
"Ye-, yes!"

We walk side by side in the streets at night.
Yusa-chan's stride is short, and the flow of time waddled by leisurely.
//Random cough-cough stuff, ain't it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, of course, please extend my thanks to your mother."
//Gotta leave it a bit vague for below -GHS

[Yusa]
"But, to mother?"
//Suddenly tense. Possibly because her mother is partially to blame for her bullying. -GHS

[Taichi]
"For always allowing me to feast on delicious food."
//HACK puzzled Yusa -GHS

[Yusa]
"...well, if you say so."

[Taichi]
"You fitting in well at school?"
//HACK happy Yusa. -GHS

[Yusa]
"That question... you just ask me that every time, right Taichi-san?"
//Besides his fixed behavior, notice she refused to answer. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, do I?"

Now that she mentions it, I sure do.

[Taichi]
"It's sort of like a fixed form for me. A cushion for conversations."
//Focusing on Fixed for reasons obvious, at this point. This is evidence he's known to repeat the same questions, and perhaps the exact same conversations, over and over and over. As if every day was the same. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Still, you've gotten sooo big now, Yusa-chan!"
//Annoying grandmother style. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Ta-, Taichi-san, I believe you don't know about when I was a child..."
//She's not being naive, she's serious. She really fears he knows. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What are you saying, you will be so many years after this being told that!"
//By annoying grandmothers, given the answer above doesn't seem to imply he already says this often. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Teheh, I've been told that for a long while now."
//By her annoying parents (unseen), or by him? -GHS

[Taichi]
"You've grown up a lot since the time we first met, I think. From what I see with my eyes."
//Now he's ogling her. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But one part's still undeveloped♪."
//HACK Puzzled Yusa -GHS

[Yusa]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Gladden me with holding yourself more precious. Physically, I mean.."
//Ah, there we begin with the 'holding the self precious', see Miki route. "Gladden" is that damn running gag, see CCC0026 for payoff. -GHS

Though that ain't happening.

[Yusa]
"Eh? Ehhh?"
//Technically the second is an 'ea', which is sorta Mikish. -GHS
[Yusa]
"That is a bit complicated so I do not really understand but... yes!"
//HACK happy Yusa -GHS
[Yusa]
"If Taichi-san says so, then I will try my best!"
//Motto-like. -GHS

She squeezed both fists tightly.

[Taichi]
"Yes-yes."

[Yusa]
"Uhm, sorry for having to take me home."

[Taichi]
"I am a young adult who is experienced in the ways of the world, having tasted both its bitter and its sweet, so it is expected of me."
//See CCA0008. Taichi's around a year younger here. -GHS

So I proclaim with a finger raised.
//See CCX0001 -GHS

[Yusa]
"Trainingful then!"

[Taichi]
"Hah hah hah!"

She's really mispronounced that 'grateful'.
//Literally it's kyoushuu vs. kyoushuku. This is either the misreading that becomes fixed into the OH NO ME SO VIOLENT AND MAD in CCB0018, or, she's not misreading anything as practicing to be normal IS training to him. This trends heavily towards the latter, unfortunately, but it's still on the topic at least. -GHS
Sooo kyute.

[Taichi]
"Certainly, a Nightly Bedroom Assault is something one wishes to do to a girl like you."
//Cats seem to top the topic, so I'm not sure if it's a specific type of fet-- ah, dammit, forgot it's Japan. Of course it's a specific type of fetishism. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Why in the bedroom at night?"

[Taichi]
"Hah hah hah, well, forget it, forget it!"

[Yusa]
"Being walked home at night like this I thought would only happen in the story of a novel.

[Taichi]
"Innit?"

Ah, right, this girl really loved Co**lt novels.
//See CCA0013 -GHS

[Yusa]
"I was a bit surprised."

[Taichi]
"But I told you before, this is absolutely normal."
[Taichi]
"Because in this world, there are some parties that will never, ever allow the small to coexist with the big."
//Remember that Taichi's not anti-loli, just anti-pure lolicons. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Pitiful fellas."

In the big the virtue is the big, in the small it is the small.
//Makes more sense remembering that, to the first reader, Taichi's going after big boobed Misato AND small-breasted Yusa at the same time. -GHS
Ultimately, either choice is a good choice, and that is Mai Philosophy.

[Yusa]
"..."

'Senpai, adult that he is, has expectedly said something difficult', says her face.
Something is stimulated.
//There he goes... -GHS

[Taichi]
"However, 『this one』 does not wish to become a man whose operative striking range is exclusively long."

* Paraphrasis: I ain't an Onee-sama Character Attribute
  Only guy.
//Consider it's impossible to go after any other girl right now... -GHS

[Taichi]
"My desire is to become a human who focuses on what's ahead, while also being careful about what is underfoot."

* Paraphrasis: I'd looove to get spoiled by the older
  while being loved by the nice young ones.
//You-jo, nice girl + young girl (幼女) -GHS

[Taichi]
"The enlightenment this one shall provide with regards to the Microists is what is called a Make Drama, a dramatic result reversal at the finish line!

* Paraphrasis: I wanna say it waaay loud and clear to
  Lolicons and show them the error of their ways.

[Taichi]
"Certainly, there is something of the freshness of youth in the flatness of a board. Let's admit that. Yet to speak of that alone is not to speak of everything."
[Taichi]
"To a greater or to a smaller extent, people will end up confronting problems of mass and shape. Perhaps it's because of their experiences of failure in life, or perhaps again it is from trials of childhood..."
[Taichi]
"...yet, this popular wishing to return once more to the absolute nothing out of those fear is something this one cannot see but as flight!"

* Paraphrasis: Sure, they may be tsurpet(snip)
//Very interesting in multiple meta senses. These lines are split sorta-random in order to avoid NVL mode. -GHS

[Taichi]
"According to materialistic values, each and every one of those 'existences' can be classified into into a number of models. Bowl Type and Rocket Type top the list, while Temple Bell Type, Hang-down Type and Platter Type are also common."
[Taichi]
"From the viewpoint of those who bore down into the most minute of details there have been cases like Caved-In Tip Type also reported---"
//Same. -GHS

Casually my glance fell on Yusa-chan, and she was taking notes.

[Taichi]
"Bwaaaaaah! You can't, you CAAA〜N'T!?!?!?"

[Yusa]
"Eh? What is wrong with that?"

[Taichi]
"Making recordings is out of the question!"

[Yusa]
"Ah, but the words are kind of difficult, so I was thinking I'd look them up later...?"

WHAAAT'd she SAAAY?!
//Random tsundere-like. Won't be the last. -GHS
She wants to implement the act of Research on these Dangerous Words on the Internet etc.!!!
//Engrish-y = flat translation -GHS

[Taichi]
"Watch out! Ambush!"
//HACK sky at night -GHS

I embrace her, and we hide behind an utility pole.

[Yusa]
"Bwha--?!"

[Taichi]
"Quiet and be still, this is a battlefield."

[Yusa]
"This place I can't see as anything but a peaceful townscape of Japan is now a battlefield?!"
//Yeah, she's toootally buying it... -GHS

[Taichi]
"So it is! Just now I felt the blood thirst of a Heishi Soldier!"
//Simply redundant and Engrishy. Of course, there goes Taichi making up stuff about the identity of people on the streets... -GHS

[Yusa]
"But then, it's a soldier?!?"

[Taichi]
"From the CIA or the KGB, but there is the possibility of the N*K as well."
//That may sound like a North Korean espionage agency, but I can't find anything that's more likely than the NHK. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Any of them is an extraordinarily militarized intelligence agency."
[Taichi]
"That last group, in particular, is of a brutality so extreme that it is known for guerrilla-like violence, resorting even to assaulting private homes and pillaging cash."
//SOMEONE hates public TV. This is only one of many strongly and sorta-explicit anti-government messages. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Hyyy!"

[Taichi]
"...he's gone. Good, we should be safe now."

Back to the street.
//HACK back to, uhm, the street. -GHS
That salaryman on his way home that we accidentally happened to pass looked at us with doubt on his face.
//Maybe the guy works for the NHK...? How many times has he done this? This is so Settei-like it's less uncanny and more telling. -GHS
An idyllic journey at night, where one could even hear the relay broadcast of the night's game from somewhere.
//Should be specifically Baseball. -GHS

[Taichi]
"My apologies. As you saw, the subjects I discussed are confidential information. Recording them would be perilous to your innocent body."

[Yusa]
"Wo-, whoa."

[Taichi]
"My apologies, but may I ask you to erase the relevant parts?"
//HACK very worried Yusa -GHS

[Yusa]
"Y-, yes, I will erase, I'm sorry!"

And with the eraser attached to the back of the pencil, scrub scrub the page is reset.
//Specific term. Interesting. -GHS
Ahhh, that eraser so unsullied, likely kept in reserve unused...
//SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"My deepest apologies."

[Yusa]
"It is all right! It is my bad!"
//She probably means that literally. -GHS

My heart was in pain.
Or should I say, I was in pain.
