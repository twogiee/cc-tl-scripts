[Taichi]
"Hey, unyielding girl with the Reversible Character Attribute!"
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"I'm giving you this."

I present her with the sandwich from this morning.
Touko gazes at it, flabbergasted.

[Touko]
"What's this, even?"

[Taichi]
"Anman."

[Touko]
"'s not that at all you know!!! It's a sandwich you know!"

[Taichi]
"So you do know don't you."
[Taichi]
"Have it."

Slid over,

[Touko]
"...stop this."

a swat of her hands,
the sandwich fell,
recovered.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"That's... none of yer business."

Uncooperative.

[Taichi]
"Having no human alive, none outside of you, that worry about you... it's painful, right?"

[Touko]
"What's that even mean I don't know."

[Taichi]
"You want people to worry about you."
[Taichi]
"You want to be fulfilled."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And me, I'm getting somewhat worried here."

She sternly glares at me.

[Touko]
"Look... who's talking."
[Touko]
"If you're worried, then why, why!"

She loses her temper.

[Taichi]
"Ah, but I'm not really thinking of trying to anger you or anything right now."
//Intentionally odd. -GHS

Smaaack.
Staggering.
That did not hurt in the slightest.

[Touko]
"...ngh..."

Right after this strike, Touko collapses sitting on to the floor.

[Taichi]
"You OK?"

[Touko]
"...nh..."

Holding her eyes shut, her face almost colorless.

[Taichi]
"...Touko."

I crouch next to her.

[Touko]
"Don't address me without honorifics, you..."

So she says as if squeezing it out.
In that moment, sweat surfaces on her forehead.

[Taichi]
"Where does it hurt?"

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Things are like this, OK? Truce."

Because there are no doctors anymore, now.

[Taichi]
"TOUKO!"

[Touko]
"My eyes, I can't see..."

Loss of eyesight?
She's shivering.

[Taichi]
"Anything else?"

[Touko]
"I feel nauseous. I feel dizzy... like to throw up."

[Taichi]
"Want to throw up?"

[Touko]
"...no!"

[Taichi]
"Then lie down!"

Urgently.
Touko had no resistance.

[Taichi]
"Eyes?"

[Touko]
"All dark..."

Is this just loss of eyesight?
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension looks legit -GHS
If so, we're still good.
Anything is preferable to serious illnesses, or external damage that reaches internal organs.

[Taichi]
"Stay composed, OK? Don't you dare panic."

[Touko]
"......I'm fine."

[Taichi]
"Was there anything out of the ordinary physically in the last few days?"

[Touko]
"Nothing."

[Taichi]
"Did you get some powerful medicine or something poisonous on the eyes?"
//Accidentally, maybe, but given it's her... -GHS

[Touko]
"None, no."

Okay.
Really all of a sudden then.

[Touko]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Touko]
"I think I'm starting to see something now."

Relief.

[Taichi]
"Then this was just anemia."

[Touko]
"Anemia?"

[Taichi]
"The symptoms seem to be all there. It should also cause your feeling of nausea."

[Touko]
"Right..."

[Taichi]
"How's your nausea?"

[Touko]
"A bit... better I think..."

[Taichi]
"...seriously, are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"......"

A silence that meant denial.
//Similar, but different, from CCA0028 -GHS

[Taichi]
"No appetite, is that it?"

Touko slowly raises to sitting.

[Touko]
"...never in Summer."

[Taichi]
"But an attack of anemia is bad, Sensei!"
//As she's a martial artist as well. And in pretty much the same sense he is (not at all). -GHS
[Taichi]
"What have you eaten today?"

[Touko]
"......"

She didn't eat anything...?

[Taichi]
"Here, sand and witch."

[Touko]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Sandwich."
[Taichi]
"According to the legends, it was eaten sandwiched between sand and a witch, and that is the origin of its name."
//Just for stupids. Actually British, the favorite food of the Earl of Sandwich so he could stay at the cards table longer without a full lunch. Wow, that was particularly useless knowledge. -GHS

A most nice bit of nonsense to deceive the shallow etymologies & legends snobs.
//Do keep thinking this is about Purty Words, my dear illiterates. -GHS

[Touko]
"......"

Touko rubs around her eye sockets.

[Taichi]
"How's the eyes?"

[Touko]
"I can see."

[Taichi]
"Here."

Touko's hand went up, slow and steady like the rising of the waterline, and seized it.
//Waterline/water level will return. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nicey nicey."

[Touko]
"I'm not some pet..."

Even her straight-man has no strength.

[Taichi]
"This is hand-made, I'll have you know."

Fidgeting she removed the wrap, then took a little nibble.
//MUGU, MUGU. -GHS

[Touko]
"...it's all dry."

[Taichi]
"They're this morning's."
//Hour is undetermined. Possibly nearing noon. -GHS

[Touko]
"It's too big and hard to eat."

[Taichi]
"It was made for me."

[Touko]
"There's way too much mustard."

[Taichi]
"I really like 'em harsh and spicy."
//Intended to be a riff of how he likes 'em tsundere, but it's interesting considering curry is Christianity. -GHS

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Well, is it bad?"

[Touko]
"......delicious."

[Taichi]
"Well then, eat it slowly."

[Touko]
"Sob."

She was sniffling.
Mortified, it seems.
Dear me, dear me.

[Touko]
"Ngh."

She clamps down her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Need to vomit?"

Shake of the head.
Deglutition, even if forcefully.
//See CCA0004... -GHS

[Touko]
"...I wanna drink something."

[Taichi]
"My canteen."
//My + water + pipe... dammit, that's too forced. -GHS
[Taichi]
"An essential in a fallen world."

I hand it over.

[Touko]
"..."

With excessive hesitation,
she puts it to the mouth,
then raises the canteen's butt to the sky.
Her throat giving protuberance as water passes through. Vigorously.
//HOLY SHIT SHE'S A TRAP -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you're not replenishing your fluids regularly?"

[Touko]
"But there's no running water."

[Taichi]
"Tasaki Store."

[Touko]
"...I went, but,"
[Touko]
"They fell on the way home, and rolled all the way to the bottom of a hill."
//See CCA0004. I guess they broke too? -GHS
[Touko]
"Clumsy-chan I'm gonna call ya."

[Taichi]
"You could've just returned to the store and taken more."

[Touko]
"...but then I would just have to write another memo and then,"
//Flustered -GHS
[Touko]
"if people were to see it..."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Just because of that?
It's only a question of honor?

[Taichi]
"One's life takes precedence!"

[Touko]
"But..."

She became as if to cry.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, Kirihara-sensei, you are acting too much like the funny man in a comedy duo you are!"

[Touko]
"I am delicate!"

[Taichi]
"If there's no people anymore, then the recognition of values like that disappears."
//See CCA0021 -GHS

Nothing is permitted anymore either.
//Seems to be in the meaning of, "what gives permission is gone". -GHS
All that is demanded now,
is the strength to live.
//"And do what you will shall be the whole of the law". -GHS
That is a person existing in pure Individuality.
All desires are being usurped by the previously scorned wants.
//See CCA0021 again -GHS
I didn't think those wants were in Touko.
No.
They are something that I discovered, long ago.
//HACK This is erroneously onscreen for less than a fraction of a second, copied this from the otherwise 'pasta script CCD0020B. -GHS
Touko's violent weakness,
I had understood.
This gal's already at the limit.
Mankind fallen, her family also gone, and in that enormous castle-like mansion...
...her, alone.
//That's because her parents are still on vacation. They DID leave her there for a week at camp, didn't they. Hell, they even let her go to Taichi's house. Even before this possibly metaphorical Fall she was left well enough alone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...from now on, we're going to have to make do and live with only eight of us."

[Touko]
"............"

The silence is heavy.

[Touko]
"Everybody'll just die."

[Taichi]
"Die we will."

Death is an inescapable eventuality for everyone.

[Taichi]
"The problem is when one dies, and how."

[Touko]
"This... can't be can it... people are just... not there anymore."
//STILL can be because she's lonely. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But it's reality."

I thrust it before her.
//o.O -GHS

[Taichi]
"This world has painted out all people. We alone are... reciprocal."
//Awww don't spoil iiit! -GHS

[Touko]
"This is unbearable for me..."

[Taichi]
"Hummm."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

This flow, it's...
//Water-related word. Connects to many more things, but especially the concept of "game flow". -GHS
There's... no other way, perhaps.
There was involvement. A wish for it.
//Here with Touko, but also before at the hokora. -GHS
The relationship I wanted to build with Touko was never to be in any way similar to honey, but...
//Translation: BAKAPPURU HANTAI -GHS
...the choice to abandon this broken girl to herself will never appear.
//Meanwhile, in inaccessible scripts... -GHS
Up to partway through it's fine.
But... what about the very final part?
What to do?
What will I even do?
There are no more places to escape to, no mistake.
Even if I ride this flow that ought be called the Touko Route, even if I go all the way to the edge, even if nothing is there but Downfall...
//Name drop. x2. -GHS
This time, not going together to that demise will be impossible.
While being hailed torment by the agony that is this over-ripeness.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"If whatever you do it remains unbearable..."
//He's planning on inviting her to live with him. -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh...?"

Touko's response is sensible.
I clam up.

[Taichi]
"...whatever I do, what?"
[Taichi]
"No, well, it's fine if you eat it all."

I stand up.

[Taichi]
"Say,"

[Touko]
"...mwht?"

Touko was still nibbling on her sandwich.

[Taichi]
"What do you think annihilated humanity?"

I look outside the window.
It wasn't a question I expected an answer for.

[Touko]
"This isn't annihilation, no."

An unexpectedly philosophical answer returns.

[Touko]
"...they've just thinned out until they were gone."
//HACK slow fade to black -GHS
