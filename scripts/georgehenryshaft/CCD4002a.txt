[Taichi]
"Ah, I'll be coming too!"
//HACK yada yada redisplay yada -GHS

[Miki]
"...yes, please do."

She might get anxious if she's on her own.
We join hands again.

[Miki]
"...why is this even happening..."

[Taichi]
"Dunno, dunno."

[Miki]
"But there's no bodies, so does that mean they all just vanished?"

[Taichi]
"They've all gone somewhere, who knows."

[Miki]
"But where..."

[Taichi]
"Look, we have a power plant here. They might have evacuated."
//This is more like what happened with the Hasekura in CCC0000 than Chernobyl. -GHS

[Miki]
"Meaning that it's dangerous here?'

[Taichi]
"Well... I dunno."

[Miki]
"But then... I don't think that can be the reason for why the radio and the telephone aren't usable."
//Lit. "aren't understandable", obvious troll is obvious now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, yeah, right."
//Great lying, moron. -GHS

And, Kiri's house.
//No wonder her head is so puffy, she literally lives in the clouds! -GHS
We explored the house half apiece, me and Miki.

[Taichi]
"Got anything?"

[Miki]
"She's not there?"

[Taichi]
"Not where I looked."

Miki's shoulders droop down.
//What the hell are they doing at Tasaki? Gunjou is between here and Kiri's house! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Maybe we've passed by each other and didn't meet. How about we return to school?"
//HACK fade doll -GHS

[Miki]
"She must have passed through that road, she must!"
[Miki]
"We can't have passed by each other..."
//There was no crossing, in other words, SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Maybe she went to school ahead of us?"
//His lies are just getting worse by the second. Forget lacking Kiri, there's no way Miki can't tell that Taichi is being this damn dishonest. -GHS

[Miki]
"......"
[Miki]
"I'm sorry, I'll be searching for her!"
//HACK out with the doll, footsteps SFX -GHS

She dashes out.

[Taichi]
"Ah, waaait!"
[Taichi]
"And she's gone..."
//HACK NVL mode. Damn, gloomy. -GHS

And after that, Miki continued to search for
Kiri for three days.
In her day-long searching, Miki completely
rejected the outside.
//COUGH COUGH COUGH -GHS
And on the third day, the seclusion was complete.
//This has nothing to do with her being secluded at home; she is just ignoring him and everyone else. It probably doesn't get any clearer that what they're doing is within their minds. -GHS
However much persuasion I use, there is no
indication that she will come out.
By now, that heart was completely enshrouded
by despair.
                  ...failure.
