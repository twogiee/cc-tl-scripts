The school infirmary.
//Eh, just this once. -GHS
A space that demands a teacher nurse with glasses and big boobs (oftentimes with the verbal expressions of a man, like saying 'sugee' instead of 'sugoi').
//Specified due to of course. Not 養護教諭, which is used below. Unsure of the difference, perhaps fetishism, training, gender... typo? -GHS
An infirmary with no teacher nurse with glasses and big boobs is like medium-fatty tuna served without any condiments at all.
//Or a tuna that doesn't fit into the joke...? -GHS
However, right now, I of course cannot have any expectations of a teacher nurse with glasses and big boobs.
//Someone likes those words sooo veeery muuuch. -GHS
Instead, Youko-chan was there.
//Booo! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Put on glasses and wear a white labcoat!"

[Youko]
"...yes."

She disappears towards the beds.
She returns wearing glasses.
Procurement was way too fast.
And why from the beds even...
Next up, she goes to the locker that the schoolnurse uses.
//Different term here. -GHS
Inside there was a white robe.
She comes back.
Delivered as ordered.

[Time required]
short of 10".
//HACK hellooo Nurse Youko. -GHS

[Youko]
"...is this fine?"

[Taichi]
"Better than Templeton Peck."
//HACK Nurse Youko with eyes closed -GHS

[Youko]
"I see."

Not conceding this is out of the question:
her bust is, well, not bad at all.
White-Robed School Nurse Youko-chan...
//HACK Nurse Youko overlap 1. This looks like crap, sorry. -GHS

[Nurse Youko]
『Strip. I cannot diagnose you otherwise.』
[Nurse Youko]
『Below too.』
[Nurse Youko]
『Because this is a medical examination of sexual functions.』
//HACK Nurse Youko overlap 2 -GHS
[Nurse Youko]
『...no good. If you touch me, you won't get away with it.』
//HACK Nurse Youko overlap 3 -GHS
[Nurse Youko]
『...yes... stand firm like that... good boy...』
//HACK Back to Nurse Youko eyes closed -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nh-, ngggh..."

Pretty nice ain't it.
//HACK Nurse Youko eyes open -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi seems to be currently having ribald delusions about me."

[Taichi]
"..."

The taste of defeat.
It's because we have known each other for so long.

[Taichi]
"That's enough cosplay for now."
//HACK Nurse Youko eyes closed -GHS

[Youko]
"I've been made to cosplay..."

Muttering with a sigh.
//HACK back to empty BG -GHS
She returns to the herself of always.
//See CCA0017A. Curious that there's so many tiny references to Misato when she's in the room, isn't it. Could it be because there's no one else? -GHS
She really does go back to the beds to return the glasses.

[Taichi]
"So, why are you here?"
//Interesting that the doll switches with a fade in the original script; normally they don't fade unless it's their first appearance on screen. This is indeed the first doll that appears in the console version after her changing. Wonder how late in production Nurse Youko was cut... -GHS

[Youko]
"...Miyasumi was injured."

I peek into the beds.
//BG aside, I suppose the curtain is drawn. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mimi-senpai?"

[Youko]
"She is already asleep."

[Taichi]
"...medical services?"

[Youko]
"Performed."

I stare at her very very fixedly.
//That's almost duct tape levels of fixedness. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So rare... you did something to help someone else spontaneously."

[Youko]
"If I hadn't... I thought Taichi would bully me..."

[Taichi]
"I see."

I certainly would.
I pinch her cheeks on both sides.

[Taichi]
"Bullied regardless."

[Youko]
"...indeed."

Her noblewoman's face kneads like clay.

[Youko]
"Stop it."

But she doesn't resist seriously.
She doesn't know ways to resist.
Because at her foundation there are either removal or ignoring all the way through.
//See CCC3005 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Rubbity rubbity!"

[Youko]
"Ng-, ngggh..."

[Taichi]
"Soft cheeks yours, aren't they."

[Youko]
"...hurts... hurts so much..."

[Taichi]
"It's your having cheeks that's to blame."

[Youko]
"That's nonsense."

I quickly tire of this.

[Taichi]
"So, what are Senpai's injuries?"

[Youko]
"Light abrasions and bruises. Her life is in no danger."

So she said with a cheek turning somewhat red.

[Taichi]
"Right."

On closer look, I see she has a light sleeper's breathing.
It doesn't seem to be labored.

[Taichi]
"She's sound asleep."
//See CCB2019 for why it won't last. -GHS

I draw through her hair to her forehead.

[Misato]
"Nnnh."

A moan from the throat.
Indeed moe.
//Seems to be just a literary form of saying 'moe'. Now, is looking that up borderline OCD or completely OCD ha ha I spent a year on this already of course it's OCD but Japan has a literary form of saying 'moe', that's just crazy man. -GHS
Next I extend my hands towards a different part.
Snatch!

[Taichi]
"Nmuh!"

Youko-chan had grasped my wrist.
A grip on the level of an adult male!
//See CCC3005. Wonder if she's the literal nurse now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...whass'at for."

[Youko]
"Taichi was currently attempting to perform a Bajungas Touch."
//Tying the term to below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"NO-, NOO (No)."
//More than English, it's using Tomoki's words with regards to Misato that's suspect. -GHS

[Youko]
"Choosing to turn to English is suspicious I think..."
//See below -GHS
[Youko]
"As Taichi is weak at English, that is an important point in a deduction."
//See CCA00016. It makes a bit more sense in Japanese... but that'd be only a worry if we weren't speaking Japanese. Right-o, lads? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Guh, she researched me to that extent..."
//And she doesn't understand him at all! -GHS

Indeed society is metagame in every way.
//See CCB0005. -GHS

[Youko]
"As long as there is the spark of life in my eyes, I will not allow you to touch these Bajungas."
//See below still -GHS

[Taichi]
"How dare you!"

But close-quarters combat has no chance of success.

[Taichi]
"If this is how it's going to be... then your chest I shall be going over now!"
//揉 Oh, it's not over by far. -GHS

I dispatch a single hand towards her breast.

[Youko]
"...I thought it would come to that, yes."

Youko-chan's eyes both filled with fearless self-confidence.
What does she know!
But even if there is a trap,

[Taichi]
"I shall be rubbing right through it!"

Snatch! and my left hand seized her breast.
//It's a running gag now I guess...? -GHS
No bearing of avoidance, no sign of defense either.
Is this indeed a trap?

[Youko]
"Caught..."

[Taichi]
"WHAT?!"

[Youko]
"Confused, Taichi assaulted what was in front of his eyes, me... a move I anticipated."

[Taichi]
"This tactile sensation, could it be?!"

[Youko]
"Indeed... no-bra."
//See CCA0016. Someone was watching. See CCD1001 for more on this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, AAAAH, WHAAAT?!"

Soft.
From over her uniform, a tactile sensation of softness that even imagination cannot speak of!
//HACK let's COMPLETELY UNSUSPICIOUSLY begin to fade to white like in those flashbacks. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, AAAH!"

My wisdom vanishes before my eyes.
//HACK further white blend -GHS

[Taichi]
"M-, my Sophia (wisdom)..."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_%28wisdom%29 -GHS

Via my touching this soft and springy bosom, my intelligence is indeed being wholly disassembled!
//See CCC0000. Same term used for the world at the loop. Nice. -GHS
The higher the voluminousness of the chest, the faster the velocity of that disassembly.
//HACK further white blend -GHS

[Taichi]
"Guh, what's with... these breasts... feels like I'm turning totally dumb..."
//Oh noes, trapped into the stupidifier! Quick, switch to Annie before you lose all your commands and... oh wait they restore with time??? I didn't know that in nearly 20 years of, uhm, what were we talking about again? -GHS

Before I knew it, I was sinking them into with both hands.
//HACK total white -GHS

[Youko]
"...ngh..."

A feverishly husky voice.
It enters the ear and make my rationality evaporate.
//Now THAT is dangerous. Mimi... -GHS
Up down left right every direction every side east west south north.
//Overliteralized the one in the middle because of ["Japan" not allowed as reason, please input another] -GHS
My massage makes those breasts travel with a degree of freedom comparable to an analog controller.
//I agree with this diatribe, two analog controllers are necessary for proper enjoyment. Uhm, see CCA0025C. These are Misato's boobs. -GHS

[Youko]
"Tai... chi, nh..."
//See CCA0016 once again. What if he's done there the exact thing he's done here? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Guh, why is this Busto so Sofistiketedo..."
//Continuing with Engrish... -GHS

[Youko]
"I don't, know at all... ah..."

Aaaah.
I have been made prey of temptation.
Artfully been made prey of temptation.

[Misato]
"fWaaah〜"

Senpai had awakened.
//HACK remove white -GHS

[Misato]
"...unacceptable... sleeping while wearing glasses... sleeping..."
//HACK earlier doll -GHS

She took notice of our foolishness.
//And this is the absolutely first time ever in the whole of Cross Channel that anyone interacts with both Youko and Taichi... or do they? -GHS

[Misato]
"SE'YAH!"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

A hand chop swung downwards.
It severs the contact between fingertip and udder.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun!"

[Taichi]
"Ye-, yes!"

[Misato]
"That now was a yellow suspension do you know!"
//RED SUSPENSION C'MON! -GHS

Snatch!, and she thrusts a finger at me.
//BTW: "gasshi", the (odd, undocumented) SFX used here, also means "to combine". Let's say it's a coincidence. Let's say that. -GHS
Could there be a red suspension I wonder...
//What you'd call a full mast? See CCA0003 -GHS

[Taichi]
"B-, but this here is a Sofistiketedo Bajungal!"
//Banjugas + gal, should be clear with the Bajungas Touch above. "おっぱいのでかい子" confirmed to be this http://ts.revinx.net/project/dic/crossc.htm -GHS

[Misato]
"Being an urbanly refined Bajungal is not the kind of thing that can allowed as an excuse!"
//http://www.boobpedia.com/boobs/Alternate_names_for_breasts I can't even wonder WTF, I am too flabbergasted that this isn't a Japanese page -GHS

With a heroic gesture that reminds of the slaying of her enemy, Senpai scythed her arm sideways.
//It's a very chuuni gesture. And the very next line... -GHS

[Misato]
"It has been a while, Hasekura-san."
//This is the absolute first time that any character has interacted with Youko and Taichi simultaneously. It is also the single and only line that Misato actually addresses at Youko throughout the entire scene. She's also changing in mood immediately and straightly, just like the similar scene in CCA0016. Right after a line chock full of chuuni. It can't be said it's not suspicious. -GHS

[Youko]
"...mh."

[Misato]
"Truly... owChChCh!"

[Taichi]
"Are you all right?"

[Misato]
"Yes, for some reason the materials fell down on me..."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan has saved you you know."

[Misato]
"Oh... it was Hasekura-san?"

[Youko]
"I was not the one who saved her, no."
//These two lines are not necessarily directed at each other... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then who?"

[Youko]
"...Shima Tomoki."
//HACK (...though this may be just another instance of a character reacting to the wrong line...) -GHS

[Taichi]
"It was Tomoki?"
//...but only when he and he repeats it out loud, so if she were to have said nothing, Misato would still hear this. -GHS

Ah-hah, that is why that guy just earlier...

[Taichi]
"Senpai, that guy's really shy, so..."
//HACK perplexed Misato. -GHS

Senpai was standing in blank amazement.
//And this'll be the least strange interaction with Taichi, Youko and someone else... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hello?"
//She doesn't even seem to be 'here' anymore. Of course, metaphircally it fits - it's how she ignores the world, similarly to how everyone else does, one way or another. -GHS

[Misato]
"Tomoki has... me...?"

She also seems to be disconcerted.
//HACK dusk sky -GHS
When did it even begin,
the disappearance of any and all verbal contact between these two.
In the club room Tomoki,
Senpai in the broadcast room.
The mere mutual simultaneous presence of both in the same space became rarity.
It was something that could be perceived by anyone who went and looked.
Just that the reason for it, alone, they kept to themselves.
Our discord was something that existed between anyone.
//HACK back to room, Misato alone -GHS
When I come to notice, Youko-chan had disappeared.
//As always, if she had never been there in the first place. Or, given Misato's refusal of noticing Taichi, maybe as if he was the one who left. -GHS
