"Hellooo."
//HACK zoom -GHS

[Misato]
"Aaah, good morning, yes."

[Taichi]
"How is it going?"
//HACK less sad Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Not favorably at all."

[Taichi]
"What a problem."

I look at the antenna.
//NOT a copy paste? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS???? -GHS
At the base, steel framing, wiring, tools, the like... oh, come on, she just keeps leaving those tools high up there.

[Taichi]
"Hmm-hm, this is the antenna the rumors talk about theeen,"
//It's everybody's favorite, antenna. But even if you say such things, I must pierce such a small honeypot with my brobdingnagian meat poleaxe? -GHS

and with that I go to lay down on the floor the hazardous materials from the top of the stepladder.

[Misato]
"...uhmmm?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, so that's how it happens then!"
//He may still be talking about her work at the antenna, trying to distract her. -GHS

I also put all the tools hung partway up the antenna on the floor.

[Misato]
"Are you still asleep?"

[Taichi]
"No, hyper awake I aaam!"
[Taichi]
"Then well then, seeya-seeya!"

Senpai watched me leave, mouth agape.
Pulling them down at this juncture she won't be injured... probably.
//HACK earlier, sharper music cutoff -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah."

...but if I don't let her get injured, then there won't be any progress, will it?

[Taichi]
"Yeah, but..."

But letting the incident just happen because of that...

[Taichi]
"Sigh."

In the end, there will likely be no acceleration in the capture from this.
