On going to open the door there was just a bit of hesitation.
//These need to all fit CCB0005 as well. -GHS
And I also thought, how could one do this after all that?
Yet humans are animals of mood, and this morning that was the mood.
For myself, that is explanation enough.
//And rationalization. Notice that right now Misato should be REALLY pissed at Taichi. -GHS
But what will Senpai even think?
That was a little bit worrying.
Turning the handle, I push out the iron door.
The wind blew,
//Plus all the meta stuff about Misato. In short, it would go in the explanation anyway. -GHS
on the exact instant I stepped outside.
//The implication is that the wind started when he was there. Hallucination in part, in part hints at the above interpretation(s). Which may just be hallucinated because his hallucinations still betray a truer reality. -GHS
But, inexplicably, that made me feel all bright and cheerful.
Ahead in my line of sight, standing apart from the large water tower on the staircase with which it shares the foundation, stood a large antenna.
//And the antenna is clearly on a different level from the staircase, so how it can share foundation I simply don't know. Plus there's those three steps before the antenna, so, dunno. Anyway, there are Two Towers in this place close to God and the outside world: it's a Tolkien reference. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."
//Unsure what attitude this is supposed to be. Doesn't sound *that* cheerful. -GHS

A still unfinished antenna,
components and knowledge both insufficient.
Yet little by little it was taking shape, as that insufficiency was being supplemented by proactive feelings,
those of a single solitary girl.
//Solitude still focus. -GHS
And that single solitary girl, right now,
stands with the antenna, cradled in the wind.
Admiration, so much it becomes jealousy.
//For her ability to escape. -GHS
It's Miyasumi Misato,
Misato-senpai.

[Taichi]
"Senpaaai!"

I called out to her, and the black hair that the cradling wind had made so membranous twisted about grandiosely.
//See book. Otherwise: yuck. -GHS
Turning this way,
the strong wind made her glossy long hair as if a raging stream.
With difficulty, Misato-senpai parted the flow of her hair with a hand, so her face would peek out.

[Misato]
"..."

An expression of engrossment clings to her face, under the sunlight already growing in strength.
//As in, she's lost in her flight. -GHS
The date of Summer's lease is coming to an end,
//Usurai is a really pretentious way of saying "the season is ending": http://nihongohaomosiroi.seesaa.net/article/159092872.html (Japanese) so have some Shakespeare instead. -GHS
and therefore I know how that would melt off in an instant.
//This line just makes me laugh. I'm sort of wagering it's intentional. Of course he knows her face would melt off, she's about to 'build' her smile. Like Taichi does, according to her. If she's not projecting. -GHS

[Misato]
"......?"

Her plump reddening lips begin to part as words begin to be formed.
A gust of wind near my ears drowned out what was but a murmur with its roar.
By the movement of her lips I knew what she had said.
//He can't read lips. He's just hallucinating the words, see CCB0005. Notice how we don't actually hear them. -GHS
Grinning broadly, I replied,

[Taichi]
"I have cooome!"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun..."
//'distant voice'. But such directions don't seem followed? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hellooo!"

I thrust both hands to the sky and shout.
//See CCA0010, supposing "I surrender". Also means "to pressure one's superiors", interestingly enough. -GHS
And, the corners of Senpai's eyes fell.
As if watching a time-lapse film, a look of gentleness fades in.
//Obvious artefaction. -GHS

[Misato]
"Heeellooo!"

So came the answer.
The girl that she is always.
//Somewhat recurring. -GHS

[Misato]
"What can I help you wiiith, Peke-kuuun?"
//The shouts are 99% in the text, sorry. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I can see your pantieees!"
//Although pretentiousness makes me laugh on its own, the entirety of it was just as setup for this punchline. Besides requiring understanding what the hell he's talking about, the reason this thing is so damn hard to translate is because of the absolute tonal precision some parts demand, like this. Although pretentiousness for the sake of laughter seems to be in Tanaka's style, and it further continues the undercurrent of criticism towards this kind of writing when used for its own sake, it's worked in the plot: this is Taichi not taking this seriously in the slightest and refusing to let heavy moods settle in. Later on, this will become uneasy and outright cringe-worthy. -GHS

Why do I keep saying this stuff...
Whatever, she probably won't hear that right.
//"she probably hasn't heard it at all" + "she would dishonestly act as if she hasn't heard it". Bluff. -GHS
I can really see her panties, and if I'd been any closer my rationality'd be in trouble.
//Vs. what he did with Touko just before. -GHS
Having given plenty of prior consideration to the possibility of the strong wind giving me a show of panties, and therefore steeled myself for that beforehand,
I was therefore still somewhat calm despite ending up witness of the well-proportioned and furthermore sensual sinful thighs of this third year girl, as well as bearing the brunt of the passion of the reverse triangle that like an eagle unopposably ensnares the male heart.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
* "Passion of the reverse triangle that like
   an eagle unopposably ensnares the male heart"
//See CCZAS. We're in a Post-Babel world too, it seems, that humans have their own languages. Eagles because Tolkien (actually Bible, but let's not go into the advanced stuff). -GHS
  Taichian for women's underwear (briefs type).
  Taichi's striking range is extensive both above
  and below but, expectably, he considers the
  belongings of younger girls to be desirable.
//See CCA0020: he's both into lolis and the older. Likely much older, in fact, given his backstory. -GHS
  Generally, pure white is valued highest, while
  more lascivious colors are valued lowest;
  however, depending on the situation, these
  standards will change.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Without doing that, there would be no way for stinkbugs like I to ever restrain their sexual appetites when confronted with the offenseful carnal desires induced by this third year girl's loins.
//All the insect stuff means him being a stinkbug is also meant literally. Notice that this is meant in reaction to his steeling himself, not the standards changing. ...though I suspect ambiguity as both work, really. -GHS

[Misato]
"What is iiit?"

[Taichi]
"Please sell me what you wear!!!"
//Please sell me what you wear! -> please bake me some bread? -> Please buy what I wear (see CCA0013) Original pun is: pantsu utte kudasai (please sell me your panties) -> pan tsukutte kudasai (please bake me some bread) -> [ore no] pantsu katte kunnai (please buy my panties). -GHS

[Misato]
"Please bake me some bread?"

[Taichi]
"!!!???"

Seh can uhnderstand meeh at eh nearly 80% rahteh! (Mexican accent)
//Randomly foreign. I suppose American would be too obvious. I just fed the translation through this http://www.oddcast.com/home/demos/tts/tts_example.php?sitepal (Spanish language/Javier's voice) and transcribed. More importantly: this is an eight (80% is written hachi-wari), and she's sort of misunderstanding him. It's a very very early reading key: Eight Means Wrong. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lunch, let us go eat it togetheeer!!!"
//This should be like 8:30, time screw or not, so it's just a really panicky response. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ohhh, that is fiiine!"

Senpai spins round and round the fist she raised upwards.
//For some reason ぐるぐる拳 comes up as Hokuto no Ken's seminal Atatata thousand-punch. -GHS

[Misato]
"But I cannot bake bread, I cannot!"

[Taichi]
"Th-, that is too bad!"

[Misato]
"Sorryyy!"

Deceived somehow.
That was close...
I keep my Dirty side secret from Senpai.
//English. He's so gone. And she totally heard him, too. -GHS
Being despised by this one person would be just a little tiny bit heart-breaking.
//See CCA0016, where he'll ask her if she despises him for doing what should technically have nothing to do with this dirty side of his. Or does it? -GHS
Because when I was alone... it was she who invited me to the Broadcast Club.

[Misato]
"Is that what you were here fooor?"

[Taichi]
"While I was at it I also came here for cluuub!"

[Misato]
"W-, while you were...?"

Her face twitched.
//Intended to be read that she's angered at her casual dismissal of club on first pass; she's actually annoyed that he came to club at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Something I got from Didnotmentat Literallia-san!"
//Kotoba no Ayako-san, just a widespread pun, doesn't seem to have a specific origin. Since it's an anthropomorphism, of which there are a fair few (may or may not include Youko), now she's a Family Circus running gag. See CCD1001 for Tomoki using this normally. -GHS

[Misato]
"Sigh... please be patient some mooore!"
//HACK zoom the rooftop! Get used to this. I used the 1280x960 files with no resize, just cropped to 640x480. Works nice. -GHS
[Misato]
"Yes, here I am now."

She smiles brightly, her hands overlapped in front of her.
The exact spot where her hands met seemed to be hiding Omata.
* Omata (kanji: small, crotch) = Taichian for the
  nether region. It somehow got anthropomorphised.
//HACK dim the screen. -GHS
Launching intracranial Photosh*p (pirated copy).
//HACK that addition is from the 360 version. Nice censorship, by the way. -GHS
Startup completes in 0.1 seconds. That's why it's intracranial.
//That would still make it about 1 second. -GHS

[First pass]
extract Senpai's face from background.

Searching for a nude picture of a gravure idol in a similar position.
//The implication is that he knows them all by memory, i.e. supermemory. But perfect callback, considering. -GHS
Of course there is one picture of exactly that pose.
It's quite old, but it's from a nude photo-book of an Idol who got sort of famous for having dated a sumo wrestler, extreme weight loss, and some standout issues with her mom. Amen!
//Credit to here: http://www6.ocn.ne.jp/~rejina/cc/motoneta.html here she is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rie_Miyazawa See book on this. Notice the amen. -GHS
Anyway, composing the layer with Senpai's face into said photo.
While fiddling all sorts, erase while smoothening the excess parts in the areas that connect the two.
The chest part appears in truth wrong, therefore compositing with plumper and beautiful breasts.
//Indeed Rie is faaar less plump than Misato. -GHS
While I'm at it, I use Senpai's tone from the exposed skin on the arms and legs.
//No way that "while I'm at it" is coincidental. -GHS
With an eye on the whole composition, regulate the excesses and defects of light, and draw shadows.
As for the difference in skin color, add a pale yellow into a new layer, and consolidate using Soft Line Blending Mode.
//That's the correct translation according to the Adobe help pages, except it should be soft LINE blending mode (ソフトライト not ソフトライン). There's no Soft Line mode documented, so either it's a typo that went unfixed as far as the 360 edition, or Taichi's talking out of his ass. Which seems likely regardless. Does he even know how to use Photoshop...? -GHS
Because without scenery it looks sort of lonely, I pasted the image of an austere church nave in the layer below Senpai's.
//Original BG was a wall. That's an explicit reference to a Christian Church, by the way. So, on this little irrelevant aside, besides having an external real-life person provide multiple overlaps with this character, showing Taichi can have perfect recall at times, seeing him composite a sexual situation from nothing in what takes a few seconds for him, but is a long time for the outside, there are two religious references, one that in practice can go both ways (the amen), one that can't be but Christian (this). -GHS
Perfect.
A sexy 'shopped image that will last decades has here its explosive birth.
//I can't find that word used seriously outside of the Pokemon 2000 movie, so I got the word from the Wikipedia literal translation of the title. Will recur. No, seriously, it will. Although ten isn't as recurring as 7 or 8, ten years is cross-years. -GHS
I promptly saved it in my intracranial hard drive, inside the folder "Level S" under the folder "Math Homework".
//That's ridiculous! You need at least THREE subfolders for this! -GHS
The levels are ordered: S→A→B→C→D.
//This is important mainly in how Yutaka shares this, and may have been the one to teach him for that matter, but it's still interesting in how he makes stuff up in his mind about the people while simultaneously losing all contact with the world, and being caught by surprise, see in a moment. -GHS
S is the strongest, D is the weakest.
//Redundant... or is it? "Saitei" is typical Tsunderese for "disgusting". It may be that Ds are where he keeps his really nasty stuff. Sorta-literal, see CCA0007. -GHS
My real PC is also organized that way.
//Wondering if Youko's is, but more importantly, given his emphasis on Wacchi, wondering if his real PC is also full of photoshopped porn images of his friends. That'd be quite creepy, but not unexpected. -GHS
Thus, the very first thing that's written at the beginning of my last will and testament goes,
//So he HAS a will. Was it even executed? Inquiring minds want to know! -GHS
'Please dispose of my hard disk drive without even a single thought (inspection or utilization as memento mori are strictly forbidden, violators shall be cursed to the full extent of the powers of my soul.)'
//Ironically, if he's not dead, at the end he'd be a ghost of sorts... -GHS
In no way can anyone be allowed to look in my Math Homework folder,
the reason being that said math homework folder is my wildest impulse incarnate.
//His wildest impulse contains PORN. -GHS
Yes.
My math homework folder I know as,
             The Forbidden Secreted Holy Ground
                       〜SANCTUARY〜
//HACK remove dim, with doll change -GHS

[Misato]
"What has happened to your maths homework folder?"

[Taichi]
"KHH!!!???"
//Let's go with snakelike. -GHS

Ieh spokeh unconziouhslyyy!!! (Mexy (abbr.))
//Would've worked better if the term'd been longer... I guess the joke's that... well, they can't all be winners (coughs suspiciously). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Lady, is there then nothing with which your worthless servant could perhaps assist You with?"

I take her forefingers with extreme deference.
Senpai remains calm.
//No rejection to physical contact. -GHS

[Misato]
"But... it is about time for school, right?"
//She's escaping reality; unless he is. -GHS

That act of slightly tilting her neck is criminal.

[Taichi]
"School and all that, right!"

I shake my head with exaggeration and smile at that idea.

[Taichi]
"What priority exists outside of helping you now?"
//Back to formal. He's trying to work himself back in her graces, not necessarily because classes don't exist anymore. -GHS

/見里「え……？」

[Misato]
"Eh...?"

Senpai is wonderful when bewildered, as well.

[Taichi]
"Shall you not entrust this most lowest servant with assisting you even in regards to the certainty of the perpetuation of your descendance?"
//120 characters to ask "can I fuck you?" Also see CCA0003 -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"AhWahWah!"
//Girly speech is hardest, unfortunately, it just doesn't exist in English. -GHS

I restrain my mouth in a frenzy.
I reeeally gotta do something about this bad habit of passing thoughts through the mouth.
//Can't source this dialect-sounding expression. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The antenna seems to have mostly taken shape, has it."

[Misato]
"Yes, I gave it my all!"
//No problem changing topic. She knows he's... like this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is it complete already?"

[Misato]
"...not at all yet, it is not."

The antenna should have been assembled by the contractors,
but it was just brought in and then abandoned.
//Yutaka incident -GHS

[Misato]
"I am not a specialist, but by hook or by crook I am putting it together."
//Lit. 'every trick in the book'. "Following the book closely" would fit Misato's apparent personality better, but since this is a finery that reveals the truth - the term literally reads "deceiving deceiving" - this is closest. -GHS
[Misato]
"The frame may be fine, but I have not laid hand on the wiring or the tuning."

[Taichi]
"Oh my my."
//More girly-ish. -GHS

Sad as it may be, I'm no expert on those things either.
//Notice the complete lack of even the idea of calling Youko in. Who is. Maybe. If she exists. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...seems unlikely that I could help you, then."

[Misato]
"I appreciate the thought."

I chanced to look closely at Senpai's hands, and they were covered with scratches.
//This is what she uses in replacement of the wrist slashing. -GHS
Ahhh,
she's having a really hard time then...
When her slender arms could never lift up but one of those transceivers.
//Although 'monitor' is technically the correct word, it makes it sound like she's carrying computer monitors around, which have very little to do with an antenna that has no video feeds whatsoever and very little apparent need for any. Someone should probably tell the guy who draws BGs before he fills the Club Room with actual--- whoops. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhm, Senpai."

[Misato]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Why are you trying to this all alone?"
[Taichi]
"Because everybody is here. Should you not just call us to assembly?"

[Misato]
"...hmmm."
[Misato]
"Well, I am the President after all."
[Misato]
"'Cause if the Prez don't do it, nobody'll come along, is that not it?"
//Sorta lapsing into accent. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, right now no one is coming along, are they..."
//That katakana 'desu'... smells like he's saying "following you to their death". -GHS

[Misato]
"But you did come here, Peke-kun."

Waah, killer words.
//Random usages of the kanji for 'kill' will return. -GHS

[Misato]
"Plus there is also how I just want to do this myself."
[Misato]
"This is just me doing something that I like."
[Misato]
"It is the same for everybody."

[Taichi]
"Everybody... but they are not doing anything they like doing, you know?"

[Misato]
"They are not?"

[Taichi]
"I do think so."

For some reason or another.

[Taichi]
"It is just that their true feelings are sort of not coming out in the open, definitely."
[Taichi]
"Because things are like this."
//No humans + they're just reciprocally alienated -GHS

[Misato]
"Then it is the same for me."
//Everybody's in flight, therefore she's flying as well. This single sentence is definitive PROOF that Misato is intended to be read as an airplane. -GHS

Suddenly her face darkens. For an instant.
Then, once more, a smile blooms.

[Taichi]
"You are so strong, Mimimi-senpai!"

* MiMiMi-senpai = short for 『Mi』yasu『Mi』 『Mi』sato
//Still not 100% sure about why she's annoyed by this. See CCD1001 for more theories. -GHS

[Misato]
"......"

Ah, that hadn't come out in a while.
Her unembellished expression.
//See CCA0015B. -GHS
Achromatic features, so cold and distant:
this is what I would call her "me, I am quite angry right now" face.
//That's written so cutesy. -GHS

[Misato]
"You do know that Senpai does not exist?"

[Taichi]
"Apologies, I made a mistake, Mimi-senpai."

And a smile.

[Misato]
"Then, Peke-kun, I have already calmed down."
//Easily forgiven. Too easily, perhaps. -GHS

Damn she's sooo kyute...
But why does she get mad just by adding one syllable I wonder...
Why is she even alright with 'Mimi-senpai' in the first place anyway?

[Misato]
"That is why you came here, then."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, well."
//Sorta indecisive -GHS

My real intention was to be all lovey-dovey with Senpai, though.
//sooo want to translate it ICHARABU (all caps)... but that'll be for later. -GHS

[Misato]
"Niiice boy yes you are!"

My head is stroked.
Soft fingertips rustle and ruffle the hair
My hair is rustled and ruffled by soft fingertips.
Ah, having the whorl on top of my head so daintily and lovingly stroked... makes my groin ache (me=worthless human).
//Hum, now see CCC0034. Stimulation to the whorl make Youko want to vent her bowels... -GHS

[Misato]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"A tent has been erected."

[Misato]
"Eh, but where?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi-senpai, could you please tell me a mathematical formula within the range of those you learned last semester?"
//Meaning it'd be a semester after Taichi's year, meaning Taichi should have the basics to comprehend it, meaning math kills Taichi's sexual desires... nah, it's just a stimulation of rationality, nothing big behind it. -GHS

[Misato]
"Of course!"
[Misato]
"○ × ▽□▽ ○ × □□▽▽ ○ × □▽□ ○ × ▽▽□□ ○ ×"
//Tweaked a little as it doesn't look as good with this font. Comment = "should be fine without voice" -GHS

I stand straighter in reverse proportion to the withering.
//He must bend himself to hide his monster... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, if I may graciously interrupt Mamodoaselle!"

[Misato]
"You are talking all gentlemanly all of a sudden."

[Taichi]
"My calling is that of the gentleman."

[Misato]
"Also, it is not 'mamodoaselle', it is 'mademoiselle'."
//I'll refrain commenting since for the longest time I thought it was madamoeselle. My reasoning was that one of the characteristics of madamoeselles is moe. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"So, what may I help with then?"

[Misato]
"But we cannot put mascara on the pig of it being well past opening time..."

With both hands she shook something I can't see with a shaka-shaka.

"Start of classes, then."

I didn't notice because the bell didn't ring.
//Maybe it IS opening ceremony, and that's why. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Shall we cut?"

[Misato]
"My, looks like we have a problem child here!"
[Misato]
"...but that is how it is."
//She's agreeing, but to what part is ambiguous. -GHS

She looks at the sky and gave an audible sigh.

[Misato]
"Problem children, indeed so."
//Because of her own problems. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Nothing, nothing at all!"
[Misato]
"Regardless, it is hot in daytime, therefore... we should not be doing hard manual labor here."
//She's just pushing him away. -GHS
[Misato]
"So even if we go to all the trouble to cut, there is nothing to do."

[Taichi]
"Ah, right."

It'd be a big problem if we ended up with sunstroke.

[Misato]
"I will begin again after dusk."

[Taichi]
"Can I help you then?"

[Misato]
"You are so much stronger, Peke-kun."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Misato]
"Because you organize your mind as proper, and you are set on what you want to do."
//She's envying his tendency to be fixed. Not impossible she's envying his perfect flight into an illusory world, possibly even unaware of how ultimately imperfect it is. -GHS

Seems that subject has returned all of a sudden.
//This seems odd, but it reconnects to the Mimimi sentence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, isn't it the same for you, Senpai?"

An indistinct sadness came to that melon-shaped silhouette.
//Still not sure whether he's talking about her face or her b-GHS
Seeing something so as if to cry makes my chest tighten.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
That's right.
It is her alone who can make me feel that.
That proud, conventional, ordinary puff of the chest... an emotion.
//Specific: he believes himself an unemotional insect, or at least incapable of having the 'correct' emotion at the correct time: see his tears. -GHS
Even setting aside whether or not these feelings are caused by her being of opposite gender, I think I really like this person.
I want her to be happy,
I don't want to be hated by her.
//HACK disarm fade, blurred zoomed rooftop (even that? ;_;) -GHS

[Misato]
"Is there some problem?"

[Taichi]
"d'Wah?!"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

Senpai upped the level of proximity of her face to right under my nose.
//HACK back to zoomed rooftop -GHS

[Misato]
"Wah?"

[Taichi]
"I was scary'd!"
//"Surprised/frightened" in Hokkaido-ben. http://www.jinsho.jimokuji.ed.jp/bunkarekisi/hagyouhougen.htm - uhm, link worked during translation but was dead last time I checked; according to the Trap School Cross Channel subsite, it should be a relatively common variant of びっくらこく which googles straight to dictionaries. -GHS

[Misato]
"Hum, scary'd... hum."

She is impressed by something.
//Hard to pinpoint, but see CCA0010, she might think Taichi's beginning to understand how coming close to people all of a sudden is bad. See also Youko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is getting hotter, will you not go back inside the building?"

[Misato]
"Yes, I should."

The President of the Broadcast Club moved her sight to the antenna, only once.

[Taichi]
"..."

What she's thinking I don't know.
This person here does not want to show her true feelings all that easily.
That is exactly why the face of mute displeasure she made earlier is so precious.
Her gentle face is nothing but a mask, this I completely understand.
