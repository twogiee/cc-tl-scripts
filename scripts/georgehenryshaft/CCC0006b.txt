[Taichi]
"Sigh."

Like a robot I began my school commute.
//Robodian? -GHS
A sense of physical discomfort in my nethers.
//Precisely the same term used for Nanaka, Youko and non-reset Miki. Is the chastity belt only in his mind, too? -GHS
Chafing and pain.
I'll become bow-legged.

[Taichi]
"At least being bow-legged suits a fine, honorable man (in the manga hero sense)... should I go with the scruffy roughedness of Bankara maybe."
//Still that 漢 -GHS

All I could do right now was but to make my geta resound while never dropping the Cheer Squad flag to the ground.
//I guess it's a certain type of exaggerated walk that may or may not have a specific name in English, too, but wouldn't even know where to begin to research it. The cheering squad flags are BIG, so certainly walking with them's gotta be tough. Not letting them drop is cheer squad regulations, as far as I can find. どうしました、旗ふるクロス？ -GHS
As I begin to walk the hills,

[Taichi]
"Mnuh?"

The screeching sound of a tire chafing the ground.
Warning signal.

[Taichi]
"...hoh, naive!"

This flesh has been baptized in the waters of an early-morning blowjob.
This just-climaxed body has become very sensitive, assuredly!
Namely, this is a sharpening of the ability to sense danger.
//Taichi-sense... tingling...! See CCD5001. Foooreshaaadowiiing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"HAAAH!"

No matter what attack it may be, if it is predicted, it becomes easy to avoid.
Badooom!

[Taichi]
"SEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"
//...ven? Got nothing otherwise. -GHS

If only the chastity belt wasn't in the way of walkiiing!!!

[Nanaka]
"Soooorry!"

I am thrown into a grove of trees while I take an appealing side chest pose in the sky.
//That's how the typical body builder's pose is actually called. Also, I looked at pictures of oiled naked burly men while researching something for a Japanese porn game translation and learned something that won't leave me scarred for life. This is a red letter day. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Alriiight?"

[Taichi]
"...because the chastity belt protected me, yep."

[Nanaka]
"Haaah?"

[Taichi]
"Just a token of irony. Don'tcha worry."

I dust off clothes and pride as I come out of the grove,
//See CCB0002 -GHS
bow-legged, naturally.

[Nanaka]
"Bowleggity."
//Nani + gani + unlistenable moe words -GHS

[Taichi]
"...don'tcha call it 'Bowleggity'."

Damn this running mouth here.
//Both, of course, since there's only one. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Another week in high spirits it seems."

[Taichi]
"The meaning of that doesn't convey."
[Taichi]
"But I'll make you convey the truth, Tomie!"
//道 は 通. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomie "Tomie is the ultimate self-destructive entity, yet ironically she survives anything" heh. Might be a direct quote, but... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"It's N-a-n-a-k-a, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"First of all, what is it with someone who's a perfect stranger to me yet knowing my name?"

[Nanaka]
"Don'tcha worry 'bout it."
//See CCC4006. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Worry about it I will, neh!"
//It's totally a "real" word in English too! http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neh -GHS

Her motor skills seemed pretty good.
I am in the further low gear of bowlegged walking, yet she keeps pace without staggering.
From the looks of it, a flavored mix of sprightly genki childhood friend bishoujo.
The kind that would come to wake you up every morning.

[Taichi]
"So, you person who feels un-beinglike, do you need anything?"

[Nanaka]
"I don't have the feeling of a being?"

[Taichi]
"None. Lightweight. Sound of shaking a box that's not filled to size."
//Damn those specific SFX. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I don't really get it, but you mean as in the presence?"

[Taichi]
"Right. To put it bluntly, you are no human and that has been made clear by my Intercranial Deliberation Committee."
//Any queer Outer Space Hyper Intelligent Beings called OMRUS there? -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Huh, even that you got... you're way too sharp, Taichi."
//Funnier and funnier considering she'd be part of that committee. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hoh!"

Here we can see the counterintuitive effect of a morning BJ.

[Taichi]
"Via the superimposition of my meta-reasoning on this inferential skill, I am able to wring out even your true identity!"
//See CCC0040 -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Whoa, seriously?"

[Taichi]
"You are a woman of Scorpio... to be precise, I'm thinking you are an intelligent life form residing on a planet in V861 Scorpii, are you not."
//Proper star name of the constellation. Doesn't seem to have a point besides its name being 8 and 6+1=7. See CCX0001. If she's Scorpio, then she's born between October 23 and November 22. Don't see the point of that if there's one... maybe, like the biorhythms in CCC3020, it's just a superstition that's typically non-Japanese? Although it's been used more often in recent years that I've seen, blood type is still more common than astrological signs. See CCC4025: interesting he'll name his broadcast channel after a scorpion, but definitely not coincidental. If the name of the channel is after Nanaka, then the question "seven?" is still at the heart of things here. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ain't there a black hole there."
//Apparently not: "This effectively removes the secondary [of the binary star] as a black hole candidate:" http://www.researchgate.net/publication/23622409_Precise_positions_and_optical_search_for_the_38_second_X-ray_pulsar_near_OAO_1653-40_and_upper_limit_on_X-ray_emission_from_V861_Scorpii -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
//...the stuff I research, really... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Unserious, aren't you, and considerably."

[Taichi]
"...bah. That's just work."

[Nanaka]
"Every time it's a big mess."

[Taichi]
"And 'every time' and 'this week'. I don'getcha. This should be the first time we met."

[Nanaka]
"How many times have I bumped into you?"
//Of course, not just literally. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Never, that'd be never."

Not in my memories,
got no memory loss either.
//A reminder that 'intentional abandonment of memories' is not memory loss, technically. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...well, that's still fine."
[Nanaka]
"But if love were to sprout after just one time, that'd be interesting wouldn't iiit."
//This, once more, is the crap that Nanaka told her infant son. WTF. -GHS

She has said something amazing.

[Taichi]
"Eh... does that mean you have an interest towards me? This aquiline nosed me?"
//Given the eagle talons all around. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Where's that aquiline? Because it looks normal."

[Taichi]
"'s all crooked ain't it. Look, you'll see."

[Nanaka]
"Nooot at all."

[Taichi]
"Sooo weird innit..."
//All around -GHS

[Nanaka]
"It might be a bit bent or something but... I don't think it's at the level where it's noticeable."

Szok!
//Stab sound -GHS

[Taichi]
"I knew I was right... it's crooked innit..."

Ever since a time, the twist of my nose had become bothersome.
//Generally the term used to indicate the Hasekura slaughter event is 'mukashi', not this one, but I suspect it's still that one. -GHS
...I synchronize the time when self-hatred ensued with my becoming aware of myself with maturity.
//Remember how Youko refuses to accept Taichi's abandonment of his gender, true form, and true name; see CCC0000, when she describes her as a punishment, of sorts, for what he was doing. If Youko is just in his mind, then her desire to escape (broken and cowardly as it may be, see her room in the Hasekura mansion and her apartment in Kamisaka) is his, which he repressed and which comes out as this self-hatred, which would otherwise be one detail that doesn't have much of an origin. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nhhhhh."
//Unrecognizable grunt. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"What-what."

But is that true, I wonder.
There were varieties of ill will and malice coming from my environment.
Perhaps, awareness of that demanded a rationalization, which took the shape of my outward appearance.
//These support the idea above... -GHS
I must've read that theory off somewhere.
//...but not literally. It was his reaction to his insufficient reaction to the malice that generated self-hatred, not simple rationalization of malice. This satisfies the typical criteria of Taichi telling the truth, but only unconsciously. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh, whatever, it's always with the looks. The tendency in stories to describe the hero in the text as average looking and then show them as beautiful when depicting them in images will never change."
//Now he moves to meta, but don't forget that thing about Yutaka and the looks being "everything". Remember how RPG protagonists are generally girly (in certain cases, like Squall from FF8, girls written by someone in hopeless denial). The irony isn't that Taichi is depicted as perfectly attractive here, the irony is that he's not depicted anywhere near feminine enough. And his hair ain't white. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...come, come, let us leave self-poison at that."

Nanaka's face was in the same class as that of a secretary that had passed a political decision.

[Taichi]
"So, you are related with the Mankind's Fall Syndrome in what way?"

[Nanaka]
"Unrelated."

[Taichi]
"That's a lieee... gotta be."

[Nanaka]
"But it's true. Mankind annihilated of their own accord. Don't get the reason."
//Specific. And technically true. -GHS

Frozen in place I stared fixed at the girl.

[Taichi]
"...you know?"
//Not *understanding* isn't not *knowing*, of course. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I saw it."
//No contradiction. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"You saw it?!"
[Nanaka]
"Yep. I saw it."
[Nanaka]
"The world, well, it was destroyed pretty slowly."

[Taichi]
"Slowly?"
[Taichi]
"Slowly, but about how long?"

[Nanaka]
"Hmmm, that now. The feeling of passing time went away."
//See CCB0001, CCC0001, CCC0002, CCD5001. This isn't a non-answer; Taichi kept feeling his days were similar if not identical, which he rationalized as a time loop. As he slowly stopped interacting with people, he then shrank his world until he formed his chuuni (but is it false?) world where humanity was gone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's odd. Because, wasn't it all normal before us guys went to training camp?"
//And throughout it, see Tasaki Store notes. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Training Camp was two nights three days, therefore... the fall should've taken three days?"
//Starting previous Friday... Except according to CCA0002 it was a week. Except the Tasaki Store says they went back and forth. Might be a plot hole. Might. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Uh-huh."

Nanaka shakes her head.

[Nanaka]
"...it was more."
//Indeed, whether it is meant as a literal week of literal days as we mean today is still being discussed. I'm of a more complex opinion, but admittedly Genesis 1 is only laterally relevant. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ain't that strange then. Theories don't merge into something that makes sense."

[Nanaka]
"I think it's just a question of perspective."
//Still hinting that nothing has happened, and that's just how he's seeing it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

I don't get what that means.

[Nanaka]
"Well, tediously and repeatedly thinking over things past is just pointless."
//That's still not a non-answer: Taichi's jumbled memories are what generates this one-week world, where he's stuck in September of 1998 even if the world keeps marching on ahead. -GHS

[Taichi]
"True, but... mankind isn't the kind of thing that would just go away that simply, that's all."

[Nanaka]
"Something happened somewhere, so I'm thinking."
//Well, she was helpful until now, so. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Somehow, I feel it in my skin."

[Taichi]
"But what?"

[Nanaka]
"With just words I can't really explain it well, but..."
//And it recurs... -GHS
[Nanaka]
"There was this great big wave from somewhere, and I think that's what bwooom spread out."
//Hum, context, what's been said about the spread of the disappearances in Miki's route (see CCC4025) and voice seem to imply it would be 'slowly', but it's one of those Triple Cursed Non-Joyo SFX so... -GHS
[Nanaka]
"That's the limits of my perceptive ability."
//See CCB0005 -GHS

[Taichi]
"...are you... God by chance?"
//Capitalized, given the 'wave' thing is talking about the Great Flood (except with Denpa instead of actual water). Just so we don't kid ourselves here. -GHS

She gave a wry smile.

[Nanaka]
"Wrong and wrong. I'm not that important. I can't do anything ya know."
//At absolute best she's the Holy Spirit... although given Youko is metaphorically closer to being Taichi's physical mother, or at least the one who adopted him, Nanaka would be a spiritual mother, one closer to the Virgin Mary than her simple birth mother. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"...I don't understand anything."
//"Wakaranai" *can* mean "I don't know", but this isn't a semantics game. She knows, but like Taichi, she just doesn't understand. For reasons of transitive property more than similarity. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then, why are you in front of me?"
//Specific as well, since he's asking "why do you, spirit/ghost/memory, appear?" -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...hm, well, that's... I can't really say. I'm not qualified to say. Sorries."

[Taichi]
"Unqualified... then."

That's a feeling I understand well.
I am... equally unqualified to live normally, mate-ing with my peers.
//Considering her backstory, it's not impossible she indeed had just the exact same feeling (more or less justified) of being "unqualified" for this life. Given how Taichi was likely an illegitimate child and all. -GHS
That is why I was sent to Gunjou.
Because I'm someone who hurts people.
I am dangerous, so I am unqualified to make friends.
And that is... correct. Overwhelmingly so.

[Taichi]
"Then I won't ask you beyond reason."

[Nanaka]
"...mh, my bad, eh."

[Taichi]
"No biggie."
[Taichi]
"Anyway, we don't get this at all and that's that."

[Nanaka]
"If that girl does her best, she can untangle all of this enigma I think."
//This is odder than anything of the above. Of course Taichi would think so, and Nanaka by extension, but Youko has better odds getting good with Taichi as she has of solving this. Then again, laterally, she may just be meaning Taichi himself if he stops kidding and gets using his brain. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Her? Youko-chan you mean?"

[Nanaka]
"...but getting to like her is out of the question."

With lips on edge, looking displeased.

[Taichi]
"You hate her."

[Nanaka]
"I don't but... it's that somehow I can't stand her."
//MOMFIGHT -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hummm."

[Nanaka]
"I'd make her to do cleaning, then I would brush just one finger on the windowsill to point out her inadequacy."

[Taichi]
"You're thinking like a mother-in-law."

[Nanaka]
"Mother-in-law... not bad, not at all."

[Taichi]
"Whassatmean."

[Nanaka]
"Taichi."

The voice I heard from far in the rear.

[Taichi]
"?"

An impossible distance,
as Nanaka was traveling right beside but three seconds ago.
Twenty meters. That is not a distance that can be traversed in an instant.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaka]
"Because this seems to be have the most success..."

[Taichi]
"Wai-, you..."

I knew it.
Not a person.
//This returns, especially in the Kiri route. And then, see CCD0021: not people but a phenomenon. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...the hokora, you know 'bout it right?"

[Taichi]
"What hokora?"

[Youko]
『With that and the information at the hokora I was able to understand the outline.』

It is connected.

[Nanaka]
"If you want to know, 's there!"

A white fingertip shot out, pointed at me.
No, at something behind me.
The school.
No... the mountain?
The mountain path that we used when going to the training camp is there.
It's almost an animal trail, but it reaches the summit fast.
And right before that,
there is a hokora.
What is enshrined there I don't know.
It's an ancient, forgotten, tiny little hokora.
Once, it might have been that the place was dedicated to some rogue god.
Now, nobody approaches it.
There could be anything there.
With the intent of tossing this trifling doubt her way, my sight returns to Nanaka.
She was nowhere to be seen.
And neither was her bike.

[Taichi]
"......"

It was a quiet new school term, when even the cicadas didn't cry.
