[Tomoki]
"Taichi!"

I walk down the corridor when I'm stopped by a call.

[Taichi]
"Oh, you're still around?"

[Tomoki]
"Same back at you."

Tomoki's face was like a noh mask.
It's a complex distance that they keep, these two.
//Ambiguous, but it's definitely between him and Misato. Remember he's out of the infirmary room because he knows Misato got injured. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I was at club 's all."
//He keeps eyes on Misato, so he knows where they were. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I've been going to club activities lately."

[Tomoki]
"...why again?"
//Odd question, in retrospect. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nah, it's just, isn't it nice to be gunning for something?"
//Subtext that he's aiming for Misato. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Club activities, you mean that garbage?"
//Love how the term is "give fat speech", where the middle is the first kanji for Taichi. Well, now it's what he defines himself. -GHS

The inauguration of the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Department.

[Taichi]
"That wasn't garbage, maybe."

[Tomoki]
"Well, if you're doing that, Taichi... then, well, there's gotta be a reason or something I guess."
//Remember that club means flight to Tomoki. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"Who's else's participating?"

[Taichi]
"The Prez."
//HACK Tomoki astonished -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...that's it?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."
//HACK Tomoki shocked (for some reason it used to return to the normal doll here, which is pointless) -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That ain't a club..."
//Although there's vaaague hints that Miki and Kiri are in there, Tomoki's in his club pretty much alone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If I think it's club then even 'self-consolation' is club."

[Tomoki]
"...I only knew there's been moving about here and there of late, so it was about club."

I shrugged my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Well, back to you again. Whatcha doing now?"

[Tomoki]
"Club."

[Taichi]
"Wahahah!"
[Taichi]
"...eh, but I don't get it?"

[Tomoki]
"Real club activities."
[Tomoki]
"If you're free, come participate."
//See CCB2006. Appears to be a contradiction. Unless the idea that he's King of Foodsnatchers hasn't Fixed yet. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, see, it's..."

[Tomoki]
"...you'll be betrayed."
//This has nothing! to do! with sci-fi! Nothing! Nothing!!! -GHS

Fragmentary, to say.
//ぽつぽつ. See CCA0028B. I think this refers to how he just drops it in with no context, but that script'll be different. -GHS

[Taichi]
"By who?"

[Tomoki]
"The President."
//HACK keep silence -GHS

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Tomoki]
"And that's why you'd better not get too close to her."
//Ties with "you'll be betrayed", not Taichi's "why?" -GHS

Turning his back to me, Tomoki departs.
Quite an odd behavior we had here.
What could've happened?
