Right, then.
Let's go to the First Years' classroom.
The Mikiri duo might just be around.
There is no one.
Looking closer, their bags have been laid on their desks.
//Don't they have hangers on the swho cares. -GHS
They did come by.
They should be somewhere on school grounds then.
Thinking over it, school is the midway point between Kiri and Miki's houses.
//Miki has actually much more road to go. The Tasaki Store is much closer to the midway point. -GHS
That school they're used to go back and forth from might be just right as a meeting point, perhaps.
But to do what?
I look outside from the window.
I could see the pool.

[Taichi]
"...ehhh."

They were playing.
Cheerfully.
Faint voices reach me:
//Or maybe he's hallucinating the sound, again. -GHS

[Miki]
"S'oryaaah!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I said don't, dooon't!"

[Miki]
"Soh'ra-Soh'raaa, then you can't even avoid iiit?"

[Kiri]
"But we're into water aren't w-, AH! You'll wet my hair, you'll get them wet!"

[Miki]
"Were am I getting you weeet?"

[Kiri]
"Why like an old lech now..."

[Miki]
"I have the heart of an old lech, TEH'RYAAA!"
//Because she's older now. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, my haaair!"
[Kiri]
"Vengeance!"

[Miki]
"Kyaaah!"

I was looking at a happy scene.

[Kiri]
"'llyyy!"
//Tsunderes will tsu&dere. See CCZAS. -GHS

[Miki]
"Teh'rya'ryaaa!"

[Kiri]
"Drink thiiis!!!"

[Miki]
"Waaah... buuut, I ain't gonna driiink!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, kickboard usage is forbidden!"

[Miki]
"It's my shield!"
//I guess the absence of a flat-as-a-board joke here is due to her not being that flat anymore...? -GHS

[Kiri]
"Cheeeat!"

[Miki]
"The length of my hear is different, so I gotta have a handicap!"

What's even that mean.
I end up with a strained smile.

[Kiri]
"But now that one of your hands got busy, your offensive abilities have decreased!"

[Miki]
"Daymn iiit!"
//Yntentional -GHS

[Kiri]
"Time to hunt!"
//*shudder* -GHS

[Miki]
"They rescinded the hunting prohibition?!

Splashing and splashing around they toss water onto each other.
It's so innocent.
Badump.

[Taichi]
"...!"

My physical heart took a leap.
My chest was struck, lightly.
Unconsciously I was pressing onto my heart.
//Over the chest I suppose, but sudden open-heart surgery seems to fit this guro nukige well, like that scene where they obviously turn a girl into a nymphomaniac by sticking a dick into her--- wait what was I translating again -GHS
But the heart, as in the spirit, is not inside my internal organs.
What I had felt gave a knock onto my physical heart.
//That may just be arrhythmia. Considering he's going deaf/blind, that's just about on point. -GHS
I was happy it did.

[Kiri]
"KyAaAh!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah, you feeell!"

[Kiri]
"I'm soaked..."

[Miki]
"Sluuuggish, slooow!"

[Kiri]
"...now you said iiit."

[Miki]
"Oyoh?"

[Kiri]
"I'm all wet so I might as well swim."

[Miki]
"Ah, ah-ah, close quarters combat nooo!"
//She's best at that, see her crossbow. -GHS

[Kiri]
"You think you can beat crawl with breast stroke?!"
//Because she has no boobs. Since "breast stroke" is "flat swimming", that still works both ways. -GHS

[Miki]
"Hurry-ingly-pani-icky!"

[Kiri]
"I'll plunge you down!"

[Miki]
"Nooo! If you wet my hear it'll turn into Wakame seaweed!"
//This line MT translated by my ATM machine's awesome DRM management DLC content. -GHS Shaft

[Kiri]
"I'll make you into Wakame-chan theeen!"
//A character in Sazae-san, this is one certain reference unlike the others, see CCA0022 and CCD2002. -GHS

[Miki]
"Wah, wah, bad!"

[Kiri]
"Soh'raaa!"

[Miki]
"Myeeeeeeeeow!!!"
//ãƒ¼x7 -GHS

Sounds of water bursts.
Ceaseless laughter.
A gentleness that reminds of the soft flowing of hours.
A scene from a gentle world.
//See CCB0022 -GHS
I thought I would write this in the diary,
so that I would never forget these emotions.
And I, all throughout, gazed at these two girls lost in their playfulness.
