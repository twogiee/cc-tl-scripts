"Whew."

On the table was laid a memo.
                 『There's dinner perhaps』

[Taichi]
"Weeee, I'm coming I'm comiiing!"

I don't need to make it myself then.
I changed my clothes in three minutes then cheerfully headed towards her house.
'Twas a most pleasingly delicious dinner.
I ignite a candle.
A very peculiar radiance illuminates the room.
I loved candles.
Their raw flame captivated me so strongly.
When I looked at the flickering flame swaying so absentmindedly, my heart was enraptured and I could just doze off endlessly, endlessly.
Once, I even singed my bangs in it because of that.
OK, that was like three minutes ago.

[Taichi]
"...singed... dammit."

It's to cry.
Anyway, to the diary.
I open the thick diary book.
//Second of three mentions of this. -GHS
The records of life are really precious.
I went to school.
I believed that everyone would come, even if there were no people. Expectably, there were no classes held or anything, so I just hung out.
Touko was extremely crabby and mean.
She doesn't understand the situation, and seems all grumpy-grump and irritated.
On the rooftop, Mimi-senpai was having activities.
She was putting together the antenna that had been abandoned there.
That's not a simple assembly we're talking about here.
It's really hard work.
But that hard work is Senpai's salvation.
//Cough cooough. -GHS
I was walking down the corridor to find Miki cleaning.
Is cleaning to Miki what club is to Senpai, I wonder?
//See CCB0007. She has read this line. -GHS
I don't know.
Has the desperate situation that is the Fall of Mankind awakened her somehow?
Miki at last gained one point over me.
This is a most alarming problem, Headmaster!
However, a pupil growing in skill is something to be honestly happy about.
The day when she surpasses I, her mentor, grows near.
And lots of other stuff happened, so overall it was a good day.
