Touko's house.
//Saaay, without Youko, how does he get here? Walk, maybe, but it remains odd. -GHS
No... mansion.
I go inside, and it was nothing but darkness.
//This seems to partially contradict CCC3021, although the term is the same. Very hummm. Consider it's unlikely Taichi ever goes to the mansion... -GHS
The windows are shut tightly.
//See CCC3021 again. Boarded up? When? ...why? -GHS
I take out the flashlight, and head to Touko's room.
//Didn't he give it to Kiri? Oh yes he did. And what for, since he has night eyes? -GHS
I have come here several times in the past.
//Contrast CCC3021. This isn't a plot hole; this is a contradiction so blatant one simply has not to have read both scripts not to notice. This has to be intentional. -GHS
I almost ended up being introduced to her father.
...but I ran away.
Second floor.
//No hesitation this time. -GHS
I go check the rooms one by one.
I'm sure, it was around here...
I open one of the countless doors there.
Light was shining in.

[Taichi]
"........."

The window was wide open.
The wind gently enters, makes the rounds of the room's interior, then leaves.
This is probably why,
there's no smell of rot.

[Taichi]
"...Touko."

A bladed weapon was thrust into the chest.
I see, it's certain, it's the body of a murder victim.
//Well now, this is odd. See CCC3025. Perhaps, given how much he must be broken over Youko, it's not strange at all... -GHS
The weapon likely came from this very mansion.
//IOW, if Kiri had seen it, she'd have to have at least one question: why use that Knife when Taichi has one of his? See CCC4010. -GHS
A dagger as ornate as the furniture, with a gaudily engraved handle.
//Wonder if this very line gave us the Seven Sisters. -GHS
There's bleeding.
Soaking her from the pit of the stomach down to the sheets, it had become a discolored dark red.
//This much bleeding hints that she was alive when she was stabbed. The answer then becomes simple: if Kiri never saw the body, and just listened to what Miki told her (I mean, why even go to the Kirihara mansion in the first place?), then the Knife is only in Taichi's mind. The bleeding doesn't exist; it just tells us that Touko is still alive, and likely sleeping in the infirmary after a collapse. -GHS
Yet still,
what a pretty husk she made.
//And even more absolute and complete total lack of any reaction whatsoever to the blood. THIS is what a wham line looks like. -GHS
I though this noble corpse was so Touko-like.

[Taichi]
"......"

For a long time I stood still.
It's as if time itself had been pierced through along with her heart.
Touko seemed exactly as if she had just stopped for a moment.
Pull out that dagger, and she could immediately wake up, and hurl abuse at my ill manners.
//And if my theory is correct, this is literally true and we're being trolled so hard it's impossible to tell up from down. He means his coming to her room. -GHS
That was what it felt like.
...someone must have killed her.
But unfortunately, the suspects were quickly enumerated.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
Kiri,
Miki,
Tomoki,
//Seems a line feed was missing here. -GHS
Sakuraba,
Mimi-senpai.
If there were some other human hidden somewhere
it would be different, however, that is everyone.
//HACK faded, uncut Kiri doll. These'd be so much PITA if I didn't do them already. Whew... -GHS
First, Kiri.
No, I don't think so.
She was the first to find her, but...
It's hard to imagine.
Kiri's anger was genuine, and her confusion
was also very real.
//HACK faded, uncut Miki doll -GHS
Miki.
The possibility exists.
However, I don't get the motive.
We are now in a place where alibis have no
meaning, and there are no means to ascertain
wherever Miki could be and whatever she could
be doing.
Regrettable, but, she's suspect #1.
//HACK ...only one I had to do (whew) -GHS
Tomoki.
He's suspect #2.
Once more, motive is unknown.
//HACK faded, uncut Sakuraba penis -GHS
Sakuraba.
Suspect #3. Idem.
//HACK faded, uncut Misato doll -GHS
Mimi-senpai.
Suspect #4. Idem.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"Naaah."

Pretty much no clues on hand.
I can't see it, neither the one who'd be a killer, nor the motive.
Also, it's not certain that the one who killed Youko-chan and the one who killed Touko are one and the same.
...being a detective's hard, innit.
Suspect #2 spotted in close proximity of the front of the main gate.
//Going with police report. -GHS
Commencing Surprise Interrogation Attack.
//Also insanity. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your age?"

[Tomoki]
"...cannot state it."
//Remember that everyone is 18 or older even if the main cast is between 15 and 18. -GHS

Expectable from Tomoki.
Even my surprise attack doesn't seem to put him in a state of agitation.

[Taichi]
"You cannot state your age? Reason?"

[Tomoki]
"Cannot state the reason."
//Censorship. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You cannot state the reason either?"

[Tomoki]
"Yes... sorry."

[Taichi]
"Let's change question. Are you older or younger than twenty years old?"

[Tomoki]
"Younger."
//Odd, he should be 21. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You are under the age of 18 I suppose?"

[Tomoki]
"Cannot state it."

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh. You are 17 years old, are you?"

[Tomoki]
"Absolutely cannot state it."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you a high school student?"
//HACK no change. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...that is something that does not exist in this life."
//He's just playing along... or is he? この世 = "this world, this present life as contrasted to the land of the dead". Hmmm. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Which is incorrect between: Female Hi-School Student and Female, high, School Student?"
//HACK no need. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I have heard that both are incorrect."
//Note that he's asking two terms both terms pronounced "joshikousei" there's no possible way he knows this unless he's reading the screen. ...though EDICT knows 女子高生, and both terms GIS to girls more or less* in high-school uniforms. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You know of something called a 'student identification', I assume?"
//Doesn't seem to be the MateBook. Is this supposed to be funny like this? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...that is something that does not exist in this life."

[Taichi]
"Your age?"

[Tomoki]
"I am adolescent."

[Taichi]
"...I can't even verify your age, dammiiit!"

[Tomoki]
"Nothing you can do about it!"
//HACK this whole comedy scene is weak as hell, even considering it's supposed to be as funny as 'kiri-fuda'. A few new lines help... -GHS

Wiseguy's frightfully careful, innhe.

[Taichi]
"Come, come, Sister Prince, ain't no problem with declaring your age now."

Maybe.

[Tomoki]
"......"
//They spared no expense with this addition. -GHS

Ignoring me, is he now. Damn softy bastard.

[Taichi]
"Gah, playing the fake innocent, are you now."
[Taichi]
"Then I'll tell ya. No prob'. The greatness that is I is 17 years old."
//No, he's still 22 because of Eroge Years. Extremely minor inconsistency beats the original crap joke tho. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"............"
//Truly, no expense. -GHS

Tomoki began sweating.

[Taichi]
"Kuh kuh kuh, what is it, got the jitters?"
[Taichi]
"Then I'll have you hear it one more time!"
[Taichi]
"17 is my aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaage!!!"
//x27 Yes, these were fun to count. And this sentence isn't sarcasm. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Seventeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

eeeeen!!!"
//x46. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Seven plus teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen!!!"
//Adapted (he says "seventeen" in English). x110(!!!) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kuh kuh kuh kuh kuh kuh, HAAA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAAA!!!!!!!!"
//x6 x17 -GHS

[Tomoki]
"......"
//Admittedly, what else would YOU answer? -GHS

Tomoki looked at me and began crying in silence.

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha be giving me that miserable pity now!!! I ain't gone insane!!!"

No, I appear to have gone plenty insane indeed.
//Formal-ish. -GHS
Not happening. I just can't do this.
//Last line, which replaces a previous one. Suppose since the interrogation's too far back? Doesn't seem censorship. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, what are you doing?"

[Tomoki]
"...nothin' much. Just thinking of going home, 's all."

[Taichi]
"Weren't you standing straight at attention? You trying to get Denpa reception or something?"
//Trying to look up at the rooftop. Of course he totally means radio wave laterally, and after that mess above there's not a shred of a doubt. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...going home. 'Cause I was about to go home."

Tomoki left, drowsily.

[Taichi]
"What's with him?"
//Well, the answer's obvious now, genius. -GHS

I follow his line of sight from the place where he was standing.
Rooftop,
the antenna,
and also,
Mimi-senpai---
Gripping tight on the fence, she was lost in gaze of the townscape.
After a while, she distanced herself and vanished on the side of the antenna.

[Taichi]
"?"

Those two have been fighting, haven't they.
I didn't think there was much space in there to kill someone.
Miki was coming out of the toilet.
//Not the closet yet. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, Senpai!"
//PCP CCA0015, except not in Kanji. This is obviously important in some scatological exo-genesis that I don't care the slightest about. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yo! Suspect #1."
//Typo corrected in the console version script. This route had less than perfect editing. -GHS

[Miki]
"...eh-?"

[Taichi]
"Your age?"
//HACK this was probably the crappiest joke of the VN, and I'm glad I wasn't the only one to think so. This one is significantly better, and extremely thematically interesting. All doll work below is also new. -GHS

Miki gave a complacent smile.

[Miki]
"15 I aaam!"

[Taichi]
"You cannot state your age? Reason?"

[Miki]
"Didn't I say it?"

[Taichi]
"Eh... ah, right."

[Miki]
"Seems there's some aftereffects."

[Taichi]
"Yup, so embarrassing..."

[Miki]
"15 I am."

Bowing.

[Taichi]
"I am 17."

Bowing.

[Miki]
"I am fif-teen."

[Taichi]
"I am se-ven-teen."
//I'll show you love, like you've never seen -GHS

Bowing.

[Taichi]
"Seven plus ten!"

[Miki]
"Five plus ten!"
//See above. -GHS

Bow, bow & bow.
//Also famished. Not me, Mik-- no, the wor-- oh forget it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If I may be frank, I'm a minor."

[Miki]
"Me's too!"

[Taichi]
"Banzaaai, banzaaai!!!"

[Miki]
"Banzaaaai!"

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahahahahahah!"
//hah x8 -GHS

[Miki]
"Ahahahahahahahahah!"

Hyper Entertaining!

[Taichi]
"Tell me one last thing then. Are you not the student identification of a female hi-school student and a high female school student that's a high school student, aren't you?"
//And now, a line that was pure comedic FAIL in the original is actually good. -GHS

[Miki]
"Precisely so!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed... oh, and one last thing: your age?"
//Screw it, now he's Columbo. -GHS

[Miki]
"Fifteen."

I fix my eyes on Miki's pupils,
and Miki returned my fixed gaze at me.
Hand and hand grasp reciprocally.
Spin and spin in a revolving. Dancing.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah!"

[Miki]
"Hoh hoh hoh!"

There was empathy there,
and understanding, and liberation, and the four basic emotions.
//Meaning she's not totally broken (she'll bring up this fact later), and that she's an Expert - see CCC4009. -GHS
Two people who were able to dance together for all of eternity.
And there, Kiri came out of the toilet.
//The original, weak scene is below. The only thing of note is the mention of Kagure Kakka... but in the end, the way that Miki plays along so closely to Taichi in his madness is far more important than another tangential mention of how this is all chuuni. -GHS
//See CCA0015 -GHS
//1+0+0+1+5=7 -GHS
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3%E9%96%A3%E4%B8%8B Kanjis are there, timeline fits (active in the 80s and 90s), age is 100K+his real age. Plus, he's basically been chuunin' it for five decades so it's thematically consistent. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Kurosu Taichi!"

All at once she stares at me from the top of her eyes.

[Kiri]
"Miki, do not go speaking to that person!"

[Miki]
"Ehhh? Why even?"
//HACK you thought it was over? -GHS

[Taichi]
"No problem even if you don't allow us to talk. As long as we can dance like this!"
//Well, after American Graffiti, Saturday Night Fever, and I Vitelloni... -GHS

[Kiri]
"No dancing either!"
//;_; KIRI U FASCIST -GHS

[Miki]
"Whyyy?"
//Back. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Because he's dangerous."

[Taichi]
"You're still saying that stuff."
[Taichi]
"I went to look at Touko. She's really dead."
//HACK here a change of doll makes sense. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so impudently..."

[Taichi]
"One of your Companions is dead! Shouldn't another emotion be in you before thirst for revenge?"
//Manga-ish. -GHS

[Kiri]
"That's... th-, that goes without saying..."

...but isn't that the line I should be saying.
//Because he "doesn't" feel anguish at all, though that's delusional. -GHS

[Miki]
"So then, the culprit..."

[Taichi]
"All hands, me included, are suspects."

[Miki]
"...what can we even do?"

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't it be best if everyone was gathered in a single place, perhaps."

[Kiri]
"No and no!"
//Oh, a nono came out. See CCB2015. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...obvious answer."

[Kiri]
"I will be staying with Kiri! You'd best stay alone on your own as you like! Because... you are the culprit after all."

[Taichi]
"...that's enough of that, you know."

[Kiri]
"Please do not come close to Miki either."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm?"
[Taichi]
"Why do I even have to promise you something like that, Kiri?"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, agaaain..."

[Taichi]
"I will talking with anyone I want to talk with. How and whether that person responds will be left to that person's free will."

[Kiri]
"...with Miki you cannot."

[Taichi]
"That's not something for you to decide, is it Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Miki is... my very first buddy, that is why."
//Same name as Sakuraba's Sendback route. -GHS
[Kiri]
"...I have no intention to let you inflict her harm right under my eyes."

[Taichi]
"I told you I'm not gonna inflict any."

[Kiri]
"Always... bullied... because of those test results..."
//Ahhh, and her true problems come out... -GHS

She tears up
Whoooa...
I feel disheartened.

[Taichi]
"Is that my fault too now..."
//She does pin the blame of everything bad in her life on anyone she can find. It's her way of Escape. -GHS

[Kiri]
"That is why... I will... protect my friends!"
//~chuuniverse~ -GHS

[Taichi]
"...whatever."

Kiri has now spoiled,
in multiple meanings.
//See CCC4003 -GHS

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, let's drop this. You just keep going with this and that being Senpai's fault, but what are you going to do if the the culprit is some other person?"
//That's a suspicious thing to say for someone who knows this well and wants Kiri to get along with Taichi. Of course, Chuuni and Friendship exist on different worlds to her. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...that won't be."

[Miki]
"You've just decided he is."

[Taichi]
"Nay?"

[Miki]
"Naaay?"

But me and Miki are on the same wavelength, aren't we.
//Lit. "like rider and horse". I still think he's comparing her "neee" to a horse's neigh... -GHS

[Taichi]
"For starters, let's work on the Either Sakuraba Or Tomoki Is The Culprit theory."

[Miki]
"Nice male camaraderie there."
//Sarc -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't praise me, you want me to go all red in the face?"
[Taichi]
"...bu-, but, should Mimi-senpai be the culprit, then... a-, a-, a-, atoning for that sin would necessarily be, you know, with that sinfully-built bodeh!"
//See CCA0007 once again, as well as CCD1001. Prescient. -GHS

[Miki]
"Kyan!♪"

[Kiri]
"...stop this..."

[Taichi]
"You also gladden me with some wariness. If you were the culprit... sooo maaany perverted things shall happen!"
//Seems to be talking just to Miki. -GHS

I smoked an Imaginary cigar.

[Kiri]
"Stop this!"

[Taichi]
"...eh?"

[Kiri]
"I'm saying, why are you acting all friendly?!"
//Now it's Kiri who can't take this in any way with the right level of seriousness. Miki and Taichi are supposed to be enemies, dammit, that's the Settei! -GHS

The silence grows audible...
//...annnd, shiin! -GHS

[Kiri]
"When you're dangerous! When you're a menace!!!"

[Miki]
"Nah... Kiri-chin, there's no need to be all that vigilant."

[Taichi]
"I've had this feeling that I really shouldn't be exactly alive too..."
//Hum, from her speech? See CCC3009, could be just remembering that. -GHS

[Miki]
"You're way out of line, Kiricchi!"

[Kiri]
"And you're way too naive, Miki! Didn't this person here kill someone who was like a sister to him?"
//Actually a minor plot hole, since she learns this in CCC0031b, and it's avoidable in this route. Let's say Miki told her. -GHS

[Miki]
"That was... did you do that?"

[Taichi]
"It wasn't me. She was already dead."
[Taichi]
"Besides, that wasn't a knife wound at all."

[Kiri]
"And I'll believe that!"

I sighed in a way that felt more like vomiting.

[Taichi]
"Siiigh. Miki, help me..."

[Miki]
"You're in the wrong, Kiri-chin."
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Sternly.

[Kiri]
"Why... but I, it was for your sake, Miki..."
//She should be sounding like Youko right about now. -GHS

[Miki]
"Again with saying that stuff. We'll be through, permanently."
//In fact, Miki/Kiri is currently very much Taichi/Youko. Which is more evidence that, maybe, the Shinkawas were nowhere near as bad as Taichi says he remembers... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Miki..."

[Taichi]
"Breaking up, really..."
//...is he making a pun with the other zekkou, 絶好? -GHS

[Miki]
"Because I'm not your little doll, Kiri-chin."
//Interesting how pretty much until three days before Kiri had kept that Taichi doll veeery dear to her. And that doll was totally made by Youko (if she's Taichi, then no contradiction), therefore, that's how Youko views Taichi. And there they are. -GHS
[Miki]
"...isn't it Senpai who's still giving me any kind of respect?"
//HACK sweatdrop Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"?!"

Ah, that one struck and bad.

[Miki]
"Being friends means respect! Why are you even sowing strife at times like this?"
//Can't source the proverb, so went with a Proverb. -GHS

[Kiri]
"But still, but still!"

[Miki]
"Come on, apologize to Senpai this instant!"
//HACK ain't happening. -GHS

Kiri held her temper with gritted teeth.
She's in a state of considerable frustration.
She looks up at me sharply.

[Kiri]
"...who would ever do anything of the sort to you!!!"
//see CCC3002. She just can't forgive him. And she went and asked HIS forgiveness when she knew. -GHS

[Miki]
"Seriously!!!"

Twisting her knee backwards on her heel, Kiri runs away.
//HACK SFX -GHS

[Miki]
"Bwah, she ran away..."

[Taichi]
"Nice getaway, that."

The two of us gazed at Kiri's vanishing back.

[Taichi]
"...while we're here, Miki-pon."
//HACK recenter -GHS

[Miki]
"This is Miki-pon. What do we do?"

[Taichi]
"...did you... get taller?"
//HACK doubty Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Did I now? I can't really see it by myself."
//Evasive. -GHS

Of course.

[Taichi]
"My my my, if I look at your chest carefully..."
//HACK serious Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Nooo way no, hands off the dancerettes!"
//Seems like a prohibition for a strip club... or a normal family resturant in Japan. (All is porn in Japan. Don't you read about stereotypes of Japan on the Internet?). Makes waaay more sense with all the above now. -GHS

She goes in a guard on her chest with both hands.
//See Misato. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tsk!"

Well, 's whatever.

[Taichi]
"And while we're doing whatever, it's already evening."
//HACK normal Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"...should we just go home? Kiricchi's gone off on her own."

[Taichi]
"If you could follow up on her later. It'd never work with me..."

[Miki]
"Yee-es."

Miki is strong.
I didn't think her the type that would be serene at times like these.
Seems like the true mettle of a human is displayed when met with a crisis.
//Sooo ironic, considering. -GHS
