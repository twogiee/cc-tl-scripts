I'll just eat in Kiri's seat, yeah.
Today we have rice balls.
//Secret Sources in Japan(R) say that this specific type is the Rice Ball Onigiri, which are Onigiri made with 100% rice balls. Quite rare! -GHS
There's furikake mixed in, and it looks really tasty.
//whyyy is there furigana and furikake but not furicake--- ah right Marie-Ann Townette (who is a cat as well as Cross Channel) ate it all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Thank you for the food."

Munch, munch.

[Kiri]
"...why in my seat..."

[Taichi]
"Welcome back."

[Kiri]
"Ah, uhm... that's... my seat..."

[Taichi]
"Indeed. Wanna sit?"

[Kiri]
"......the seat..."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, right, that. Sorry.
//Androphobia, germophobia, germanicalphobia? Some of this don't sound germane. -GHS

I borrow another chair and sit back down.
Face to face.

[Kiri]
"...uhm."

[Taichi]
"Gladden me with eating. There's enough for two."

[Kiri]
"...Miki's gone to procure some, so..."

[Taichi]
"You think she'd mind as long as it's snacking?"
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...huh."

She extends her hand.
Breakthrough successful.
//See CCC3007 -GHS
Well, Kiri has lost heart too.

[Taichi]
"Cutlery and that sort could be seen as weapon so hands off."

[Kiri]
"...yes."
[Kiri]
"Because I... don't want to die."
//See CCC3023. What if she actually doesn't and knows perfectly nothing will happen to her if Taichi dies? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes-yes. Youko-chan's very powerful, see. And what she says she does."
//See CCC0045A, CCC3012B. Does she now? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...how come that person is so skilled at stone throwing?"
[Kiri]
"That is weird, very much so."
//Oh, this isn't the start of it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"She's great at almost anything!"
//SUPER NINJA. Also "foreign" and "outside the body". Because subtext. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Her fundamental capacity of doing seems just different."

Whatever she does, she catches the trick in an instant.

[Kiri]
"Did she get some special training?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, she did indeed. Every lengthy vacation period she goes to some foreign country and hires a local military instructor."
//This is a stream of bullshit so long it's amazing anyone *ever* read it with a straight face. He's borderline brainwashing Kiri with his chuuni. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Military...!"

She's at a loss for words.

[Taichi]
"She learned stone throwing in one of those occasions I guess. Might even be that she learned it from real-deal shepherds."
[Taichi]
"Still hurts?"

[Kiri]
"...not particularly."
//Noticing this is completely contradictory? If she's so good, then why is Kiri the Glasswork largely unhurt twelve hours after being subjected to it? -GHS

[Taichi]
"I am very glad of that."
[Taichi]
"I expect there's been lots and lots of other stuff."
[Taichi]
"It feels like her life is almost entirely used for self-training."
[Taichi]
"I'm a competent martial artist myself, but I couldn't hold a candle to her."

[Kiri]
"What kind of martial art do you practice?"

How wonderful that I was asked!

[Taichi]
"It's called Karade."

[Kiri]
"...I do not know it."

[Taichi]
"Eh?!"

[Kiri]
"Is it some plagiarism of Karate?"

[Taichi]
"You silly little brat you are WRONG!"
//dat girly wa. Same term he used for Yutaka in CCC3004, not very relevant but it's always interesting. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Kyah!"

[Taichi]
"...ah, sorry... I just fired in a rage accidentally..."

Kiri escapes to three meters away, and went into combat readiness.
//See CCA0008. Youko and Taichi aren't the only ones cross-training. OTOH, see CC0032: Youko manages only two meters. So Kiri and Miki both keep him at 3 meters, and Youko at 2... 8? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come back over here, I'm not gonna eat ya."
//I guess we can call this foreshadowing. -GHS

She returns, looking a touch anxious.

[Taichi]
"Come come, eat up eat up. It's the nice me now!"
//~eating come中~ -GHS

There is also a me that forgets hisself when he is called a Karate plagiarist.
//See CCC3016, but in general, he plagiarizes (and misreads) just about everything so it's just a detail. More importantly, see CCC0026. -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I can't really say, but maybe she can even use firearms."
[Taichi]
"In hand-to-hand, if it comes to grappling, I think you might just get killed in an instant. She has knowledge of lots of techniques, and lately, she purchased this really expensive knife."
//Kinda odd he also happens to have a weird, expensive, foreign knife that apparently she bought, see CCC4010. Consider Miki lied about having received it from Kiri, and her word on whether she has one at all is contradictory at best. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...but then... no matter how you put it, it's all about the killing..."

[Taichi]
"Says the one who wanted to kill me herself."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Come now, it's nothing to worry about."

[Kiri]
"Senpai, you are... alright with it?"
[Kiri]
"I, you, well... I detest you."
[Kiri]
"My life was saved, so I cannot do anything anymore, nor do anything to change this situation."
[Kiri]
"But... nothing changes, I still hate you."
//Not only does she still hate him with the world dead, she'll hate him after he saves her life. So much hypocrisy. Not that it matters since she's lying to herself. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hum."

[Kiri]
"Do not misunderstand that, please."

[Taichi]
"I'm not at all. I just think that's OK."

[Kiri]
"...but, eating a meal together... trying to make friends..."

[Taichi]
"I just want to get a closer look, that's it."

[Kiri]
"...closer? To what?"

[Taichi]
"To you, Kiri-chin!"

Smile.

[Kiri]
"Mo-, mocker!"

She's just a bit red in the face.

[Taichi]
"A precious gem is not something to be admired by touching."
//See CCB2005. Using his lines around freely, ain't he. -GHS
[Taichi]
"They're something to be enjoyed by looking."

[Kiri]
"...I think, Senpai, that there is certainly a part that acts like that in you."
[Kiri]
"It is something I cannot stomach. If you have to play around with girls like that, would it not be better for you to do so with Hasekura-senpai?"
[Kiri]
"We... are not tools for the sake of your amusement."

[Taichi]
"Not happening. She can't hold herself down."
//Though given the Alter Ego thing, not to mention the possible identity, something like "she's not her own person" would also work. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"I want to run away from her. Been like that for a long time."
[Taichi]
"She just gets on my nerves."

Kiri threw a look at me that said she was discerning something unexpected.

[Kiri]
"...this relationship between you two, Senpai, is something I just cannot understand."
//Oh, it's simple: he's the smart but sheltered child, and she's the oppressive and abusive mother that just won't. stop. annoying. him. While Nanaka is the mother he wishes he had... closer to an angel than a real one, though. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, don'tcha worry too much about it."

In my history with Youko-chan there are no fun memories. Not a single one.
//Since he's MEMORY HUNTER!!!, this is utterly meaningless. As she's there in CCX0001, there are some good memories still. -GHS

[Taichi]
"As for amusement tools, I don't think there's much helping it."
[Taichi]
"...this is all that can be done."
//Could be referring to how Youko can never replace all people, or how he can't stop using people for amusement. Leaving ambiguous -GHS

[Kiri]
"Meaning?"

[Taichi]
"Weeell..."

I think over it,
but I can't construct an appropriate explanation.
Generally, Kiri-chin, well, she generally sees through me, so there's no need for particular explanations.
//Seems to be tripping over words. Sincere Taichi's no more garrulous than just-woken Misato. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah. Also, if you're able to stay close to me, that'd be best."

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"I told her firmly so I think we'll be alright, but there's the possibility that she'll do something should you get away from my sight, Kiri-chin."
[Taichi]
"And without I becoming aware, poor Kiri-chin could get completely neckchopped."
//Trying to be funny again. くびちょんぱ kubichonpa (decapitation) is not to be confused with くびちょんば kubichonba (baker's dozen). -GHS

Kiri holds down her neck.

[Kiri]
"...ne-, neckchop..."

Trembling with a clatter.

[Taichi]
"For the sake of your life, thou must stay by my side... ain't that a nice thing to say?"

[Kiri]
"...of course, but still..."

[Taichi]
"Rather than reconciliation, this feels like armistice doesn't it."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"And with that said, let's have our friendly squabbles from here on."
//See CCA0030 -GHS

I extend my left hand.
//Wrong hand. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...huh."

Unwillingly and grudgingly, Kiri puts out her right hand and... cannot shake hands.
//Because of wrong hand. -GHS
She withdraws her hand, angry.

[Kiri]
"......you are making me look stupid!"

[Taichi]
"I'm telling you, don't just get angry at every single joke!"
//She expected Taichi to extend the Correct hand so much that she didn't pay any attention to what he was doing, played this by instinct, and got burned. This is no joke at all! -GHS

I correct and extend my right hand, and shake Kiri's right hand.
It's a thin, slender hand.
Certainly it's not suited for weapons.
Passing through the dangerous bridge that is Youko-chan, our relations have improved just a bit.

[Taichi]
"Then, this is a rice ball party to celebrate the settlement of an armistice!"

[Miki]
"Prowcurement compleeete!"
//Cutesy. -GHS
[Miki]
"...whaaah?"

[Taichi]
"Thanks for your work."

[Miki]
"Why are you two together?"

[Taichi]
"I invited her."

[Miki]
"...scary guy him... even enemies he makes allies..."

[Taichi]
"I just asked very politely."
//This term has a whole historical lesson behind it... but that seems excessive here. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...didn't..."

[Miki]
"Ahhh, why are you even eeeating, what will we do with this huge bag of foood?"

Miki let the contents of her tote bag fall, paf-paf-paf in rapid succession, on top of the desk.
It became a mountain that spilled off the edge.
//To avoid ending both sentences w-- hum, even I don't care. -GHS

[Taichi]
"WOOOOH!"
//7 characters total. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Ain't this all junk food!"

[Miki]
"Teheh!"

[Kiri]
"...where's canned food and the rest?"

[Miki]
"It was all gowne!"
//Cutesy again. Given CCD3003, this isn't even anywhere the most transparent of her lies. Remember she was lying about this stuff all the way back at the camp, see CCA0004. This is likely how much stuff she robs from Tasaki while writing down "vegetable juice". And since the Tasaki owner, who opens the store then wanders off to his hobby, is a Greek Chorus for Taichi's 98 Game, Miki robbing from him is a metaphor for how much food for her heart she steals from Taichi's... and writes down "it's another world" instead of the truth. Also, what she steals from Taichi is, therefore, intellectual junk food. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh. Using junk food in the stead of a proper lunch... that looks nasty."

[Miki]
"You think so?"

[Taichi]
"Terrible for the health, too."

[Miki]
"But Miki really likes sweets!"
//Hopefully someone will realize they're the same thing as junk f-- OK, now I sounded like an old politician. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Me too, but my stomach's full, so..."
//See CCC4012, which is the opposite of this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry, me too."

[Miki]
"...awww!"
[Miki]
"Well then, I'll eat them alone!"

Sullen.

[Kiri]
"...you'll get fat."

[Miki]
"..."
[Miki]
"I'll still fatteningly love sweets!"
//fu-tottemo. And I spared the pun with Taichi, which I'm sure is there. -GHS

She sets out to eat potato chips.
//BUT THOOOOOSE AREN'T SWEEEEETS. Well, that's not true. The potato is a tuber, and tubers are sugar due to various laws you'd need a thousand degrees in politicalicism and diacriticism to understand. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But inside yourself this annoys you, doesn't it?"

[Miki]
"But buuu〜t..."

[Kiri]
"Don't cry now..."

[Taichi]
"C'mon, I'll give you this onigiri!"

Because it's been made to adult male size, it should be just fine for Miki-chin.
//This line was removed from all versions, meaning the sexual pun should be this. It doesn't make much sense if it's Kiri, however, since she already ate. In CCD3003 it's Miki, and the copypasta of this script has been altered due to Miki being reset during Sendback, so it's likely a newer revision (unlike the unchanged scripts, which obviously aren't). Changing it to match. -GHS
It's not that much for me, but... ah, it's fine.

[Miki]
"Aaah, it's handmade coooo〜king!"

Hug!, she clings to the hand that's holding the onigiri.

[Taichi]
"Want sooome? Ehhh?"

I hold it aloft.

[Miki]
"Ah! Do want it!"
//She sounds sooo much like Yusa here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Allmost almost!"
//See CCC0033A -GHS

To the right.

[Miki]
"Awwwuuu〜"

[Taichi]
"Upppy uppy!"

To the left.
//Up is left and that's a fact. -GHS

[Miki]
"Uwwwaaa〜"

[Kiri]
"...that's bullying."

[Taichi]
"...here."

[Miki]
"Aaah, dewichious!"
//Cutesy -GHS

Chomp chomp she sets to eat,
while the mountain of sweets is left untouched.

[Taichi]
"...for being girls your eating habits seem unstable. Is it always like this?"

[Kiri]
"Sometimes it's canned food, sometimes it's bread."
//She talks as if this had started looong before the cross world affair, and of course it has: Kiri's family is almost never home, see CCC3004. So her having poor eating habits does not necessarily descend from everyone being gone. The question is about Miki's family, but that may be simple: she's poor enough she can't afford much to eat. That's why she steals from Tasaki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eat your vegetables."

[Kiri]
"We have none."

[Taichi]
"Here, tomatoes. Just two of them."

[Miki]
"Aaaah, tomatooo〜es!"

[Taichi]
"Ehhh? Want sooome?"

[Miki]
"Sooo want!"

[Taichi]
"Allmost almost!"

To the right,

[Miki]
"Awwwuuu〜"

[Taichi]
"Upppy uppy!"

to the left.

[Miki]
"Uwwwaaa〜"

[Kiri]
"......I knew it, this guy's... just a bully."

[Taichi]
"Sigh."

[Kiri]
"Mhhh〜〜〜!"

[Miki]
"Souuu〜r!"

[Kiri]
"But delicious..."

[Miki]
"Feels I'm crying!"
//See CCC4009. And compare Taichi. -GHS

[Kiri]
"We're living it up here."

[Miki]
"Myaaa〜wh!"

What kind of eating habits do these two even have...
While looking sidelong at Miki and Kiri's mouths go 『＊』-shaped via tomato eating, I quench my thirst with my canteen.
//See CCC4009. Miki and Kiri's mouths become like Taichi's asshole??????what??????? -GHS

//HACK slide from left instead, manual -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahkhof, akhahf!"
//Not the same as CCB2014. I am saddened by not being able to copypaste a cough. -GHSaddenedByNotBeingAbleToCopyPasteACough

She's looking she's lookiiing!!!
We're being calmly looked aaat!!!
She's just a big clump of jealousy isn't she...
Her showing herself to me is the same as suspecting me... this is an insinuation.
Being a Kunoichi, she has a high level of inherent stealthiness,
so this isn't me having spotted her, not at all.

[Miki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"...we are being monitored with the Intelligence Techniques of the Ichihara Style."

[Miki]
"Ichihara?"

[Taichi]
"A spy technique imparted by a group of resourceful Kunoichi, led by E. Ichihara."
//Etsuko Ichihara returns, but I can't see how that has anything to do with anything. Curiously, 市原エヅラ子 Ezurako Ichihara fits better. Except I can't find anything outside of a minor reference of one episode of Gintama, and the manga for that started December 2003 so it just cannot be that one. Could it be traditional character of sorts with all references overtaken? In Gintama, it's a man dressing up as a female maid in order to spy. If this is something taken from whatever is the original reference, that'd be very interesting. -GHS

[Miki]
"?"

[Kiri]
"KYAAAAH?!"

Seems Kiri has seen.

[Kiri]
"Senpai! Se-, Senpa--- it-, it's it's..."
//Don't blink don't blink don't blink, something odd happened midway through this sentence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're fine, you're by my side."
//I suspect he just played footsie. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...y-, yes..."

[Miki]
"Eh? Eh?"

[Kiri]
"It-, it's..."

Kiri points. Miki looks with a 'what?'.
//Sure she points, and that 'are' above doesn't mean the exact same as the odd one way up there. IOW: she points, but to what? -GHS
Youko-chan's figure is not there.
//How does Taichi know Miki can't see her, when he could see her just a split second ago? And this is not necessarily where Kiri points. -GHS

[Miki]
"...eh? There's nothing there, whass'it?"
//That's not necessarily the doorway. -GHS

[Kiri]
"N-, now, I'm sure that... Senpai?"
//Also note that Kiri never ever says what, exactly, she sees. Or even that she sees anything, she's just upset for some reason. That last "Senpai?" might simply mean Taichi did something. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's the Shimura Feno--- Phenomenon. Miki is no longer physically capable of observing Youko-chan."
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

* Shimura Phenomenon---
Taichian Physics. A type of observational problem
that occurs within specific, stable situations.
The observer looks, but the unseen subject has
its Still Unseen Attribute fixed, which reflects
on the physical world. Frequently, a drastic
change in the situation causes this attribute
to be lost.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Aaah, she's looking...

[Kiri]
"...ngh."

Kiri was deathly nervous.
Reflexively I hold her shoulders.
//Is he? Miki says nothing. -GHS
Twitch, and the corner of Youko-chan's eye quivered.
That is something unreasonably rare.

[Kiri]
"...ngh, ngggh..."

Kiri is so tense, she doesn't even notice my overfamiliarity,
//Ridiculous, she'd never do that. -GHS
like a cornered cat at its wits' end.
//What is really happening is, possibly, the exact opposite. See CCA0016, where Misato was also "crying". This may be entirely in Taichi's mind. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...thin shoulders you got here."

Lovability on one side, on the other, the want to destroy.
//Vs. desire -GHS
The two existed simultaneously.
//More split personality hints? -GHS
...I release my hands.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, pay attention!"

[Kiri]
"...to what?"
//See CCA0016 once more. Something that hasn't happened has happened. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Even if harm doesn't come, there is still the possibility of harassment."

[Kiri]
"Ha-, harassment? What type, specifically?"

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm... something fairly malicious, of the wet and private kind I think."
//Given Taichi and the circumstances, reading that as "wet vagina" is definitely expected. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Forcible deprivation of dignity perhaps, humiliating you and then brushing it off as a joke at the very last instant."

[Kiri]
"...is that that not the same as what you do?"

[Taichi]
"Ngh!"

[Kiri]
"...I knew it... you can't be trusted."

Kiri returned to Miki's side.
//Miki hasn't said a single word after the Shimura Phenomenon excluded her entirely. Not a word to Kiri who was shivering in terror, not to Taichi who was obviously harassing her. This is entirely out of character. This is Kiri returning to Miki's world, i.e. their own shared chuuni rather than Taichi's. -GHS
Ahhhh, same-sex netorare'd!

[Taichi]
"How dare you!"

I attempt to bear a grudge against Miki.

[Miki]
"...eh, whaaat?"
//Has his/their being 'out of it' lasted up until now? -GHS
