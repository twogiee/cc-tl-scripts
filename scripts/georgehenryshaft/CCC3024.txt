...ain't happening.
Accepting death is just out of the question.
I hate myself, sure,
hate everything.
My ugliness and my greed are repugnant.
//He still has a point when it comes to hating his human nature. -GHS
My self-hatred is no less than the hatred that Kiri has for me.
But... if suicide were to be it, I'd have done that already.
I will live.
If I don't... then what have I struggled for?
For the sake of living. Even if it ends up... that I break Kiri.
//Except he's about to do the right thing, not breaking her, even if he has no way of knowing. In this sense, this is the Coincidence that is Providence! -GHS

[Taichi]
"...just one question, though, who was it that saw me and Yutaka on the rooftop... was it you?"
//Of course I wrote "me and youtaka" dammit -GHS

[Kiri]
"Yes, it was."
[Kiri]
"At the time I thought nothing of it."
[Kiri]
"But... now I understand."
[Kiri]
"Just like what you did in the toilet, you... cornered Yutaka."
//Note the lack of the word 'pushed off the roof'. She's very very very unsure. She's right, in a sense, though. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Just to fulfill yourself!"

[Taichi]
"And how?"

[Kiri]
"...by picking on Yutaka's legs maybe... there's so many ways!"
//Soooooooo obviously reaching. Does she really think Yutaka'd kill himself on being teased? How stupid and weak does she think he is?! See CCA0011C: Yutaka's legs are the last of his problems, he'll happily make fun of them in a way that Taichi just can't do about his hair, see CCA3022. And so, if that's what she thinks he did, it stands that she'd do the same to him. Since he can't stand it, that may be what getting shot with the crossbow means. -GHS
[Kiri]
"I do not think I want to hear specifics."
//This is what's known in actually intellectual circles as a 'thought terminator'. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Are we done?"

Her hand was shaking, unchangingly.
It seemed the self would give up just before murder.
//He's talking about her... or is he? -GHS

[Taichi]
"One more, if I can. It's a tale that'll run a bit long though."

[Kiri]
"...go on."
//scaredy scaredy scaredy cat. -GHS

What was she thinking inside?
Kiri said that flat, as if not to give off any emotion.

[Taichi]
"...can I sit down?"

[Kiri]
"Go on."

[Taichi]
"Will you sit too, Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"......"

Killer silence.
Ah, whatever.
I begin to talk.

[Taichi]
"There was this family called the Hasekuras, long ago."
[Taichi]
"They had a big house. Western style. So big it was about ten times Kirihara's house."
//That'd be, hmmm... *overkill clone brush* about one third of the entire city. That seems small for the estate, even accounting for how Kamisaka seems to be a little off-scale, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay big for the house itself. Especially if only 14 people were in it. That thing would've required at least that many people to even begin to maintain! -GHS
[Taichi]
"Those guys were multi-billionaires."
[Taichi]
"I was... well, when I was a child my mother passed, and I was taken into their custody."
[Taichi]
"I was a live-in worker there, for a manager and his wife who were distant relatives of mother's."
[Taichi]
"It was a family with old customs, you know."
[Taichi]
"The children of servants were made servants, seriously."
//He's vaguely less serious here; the earlier edit of CCC3025 that remains in CCC3003B is more consistent with this, but not the final script. Interesting sentence of itself: if Taichi was made a servant, then was he the son of a servant? -GHS
[Taichi]
"I was just a child, therefore, my duty was to be sort of a playmate for the children of the family."
[Taichi]
"Youko-chan was the youngest girl there."
