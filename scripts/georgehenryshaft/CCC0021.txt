And in the end, I may have gone to school but there was nothing to do.
//Corridor BG instead of the nonsensical rooftop BG. This took until the Xbox version to get fixed! -GHS
Should I just go home?
But... I wonder if being this leisurely is right.
Sometime from Sunday onwards, the world will be rewound.
//He still doesn't know exactly when. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

What ought I be doing?
What am I even capable of doing?
What did Youko-chan think the first time she learned of that, I wonder.
//No, the question is HOW did she learn that without notebooks. -GHS
With what feelings did she leave that memo behind?
//...but if it's just his memories taking form and surfacing, then he's asking what he felt when he created this all. -GHS
I feel spent.
Whatever way I may live in this deserted world devoid of people,
all will be redone.
All the effort made in club, all the procuring of food, and all the running away.
//Curiously he's referring mainly to Tomoki and Misato. -GHS
One week,
and it's all thrown away.
So even if I live with all my strength---
...is there even meaning to that?
Vacuous thought.
I sit down hard in the corridor.
//This used to be despite being on the rooftop, hence the change. -GHS

"..."

As the case may be, this world could even be my Utopia, maybe.
A world where a mortal wound is not fatal.
All back to what it was after one week.
Whoever I might wound, whoever I might co-depend on.
Reset.
If I get on good terms with Touko, next will be with Mimi-senpai.
And Kiri.
And Miki.
And Youko-chan, if I feel inclined to.
And Sakuraba.
...that's not gonna happen.
My eyes numbed.
I have an abnormality in the eyes.
There's no impediment in normal life, but sometimes, I see the world oddly.
//See CCA0016... or rather, see CCA0001-CCE0001. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Why... I want to know why I'm not alone."

My heart was exhausted and torn, that for a while I could not move.
