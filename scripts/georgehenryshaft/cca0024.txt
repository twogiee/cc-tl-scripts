Writing the script.

[Taichi]
"Hihihi."
//First two intended to be read as laughter. This precise one comes up in laugh smileys, in fact. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Hihihihihi!"
[Taichi]
"Hiii hih hih hih hih hiii!!! (crying)"
//Total is 7x2 14. -GHS

It won't take shaaape!
This is the exact opposite spirit of that first day, when I wrote while spellbound by my own talent.
//Following the time-honored eroge tradition of having a sex scene whenever you have a writer's block... how I wish I could've written the monograph that way (hypersob). -GHS

[Voice]
"...keee-kuuun...!"
//Changed to 'voice' from Week 2 version instead of "woman", which is generally used by Taichi as a disparaging nukige-style term for women (here translated as 'female'). This is one of the few W2 copypasta scripts that show improvements, possibly because the sex scene was written then. -GHS

Someone is calling me.
I peek outside from the window.

[Taichi]
"Mimi-senpai?"

[Misato]
"Good eveniiing!"

[Taichi]
"What brings youuu?"
[Taichi]
"Where are youuu?"
[Taichi]
"Looking at you from the second floor windooow!"

[Misato]
"It's too dark I cannot seee!"

[Taichi]
"I can see you well from heeere!"

[Misato]
"How is that possibleee!"

[Taichi]
"Who knooows?"

[Misato]
"You got amazing night vision, Peke-kuuun!"
//And this is where he got his night vision, hasn't he. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I got sharp senses 'cause I'm wild animaaal!"

[Misato]
"That is pretty coool!"

She flaps and swings her arms around while she talks.
//BUT SHE CANT GIVE TACCHI HER LISENSE, SINCE HE ARE HEADCRAB ZOMBIE -GHS
That's pretty childish of her.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, please come insiiide!"
//AND STOP SHOUTIIING -GHS

[Misato]
"YEEE-ES!"
[Misato]
"Ah, a candle!â™ª"

[Taichi]
"Atmosphere is important to the act of Writing, my lady."
//Capital W because [boring explanation about minor details of Japanese no one cares about]. I sooo want to use 'hlaefdige' for that old pronunciation of ojou-san... -GHS

[Misato]
"I see!"
//...that 'hodo' also totally means 'spiky hair' and 'naru' is also 'lawyer'... -GHS

She goes into seiza with a quiet puff.
//soff' -GHS

[Misato]
"Were you doing your studies?"

[Taichi]
"No, the script."

[Misato]
"Ahhh."

[Taichi]
"Then, what might be the business at hand that brought you towards this domicile, ma'am?"
//overformal -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, because you have been so good at helping me, I thought I would give you a treat to eat."
//The implication is not quite feeding the dog... not *quite*. -GHS

She produced a package.

[Misato]
"It is a bento."
//TL note: bento means "hit accent". It's derived from an old practice of dipping people from Kansai in boiling oil. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Senpai banzai!"

[Misato]
"I made enough for two. Is together fine?"
//Remember she has no pure intentions here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I will bring something to drink."
[Taichi]
"Delicious!"
[Taichi]
"You are really skilled at this Senpai!"

[Misato]
"Am I now? But I only really started to cook recently..."
//Because No One Anymore, we're supposed to take it. Totally not because of his father being gone for about four months, both of which fit the 'recently' perfectly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, I am not exactly a gourmet."

[Misato]
"Aw, that is really a mean way to put it..."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, but it is delicious! Yes, delicious!"
[Taichi]
"They have been well cooked. Was it open flame?"

[Misato]
"Yes. Of course."

[Taichi]
"...really, eating a bento like this, it's been so long."

[Misato]
"Was it really?"

[Taichi]
"Me... my mother is not with us, that is why."
//But his mother never made him lunch, did she. And neither his substitute mother (Youko) and foster mother (Mutsumi) have. But Misato... -GHS

[Misato]
"Well..."

[Taichi]
"Maybe I just miss her, my mother."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

[Taichi]
"Senpai."

Gazes meet inside this faintest of lights.
The delicate flame of the candle shone a pale vermilion on the girl's cheeks.
