Club activities.
Miki flew out from under cover.
She cannot escape my eyes.
//Focus on eyes -GHS
I squeeze the trigger of the Uzi SMG in my hands,
//Interesting he doesn't just yank it like most would erroneously do. He sounds at least a little trained. -GHS
making it fire its bullets.
//For more contrast later. -GHS
Line of fire strays, striking Miki's underfoot.

[Miki]
"...ngh?!"

Miki notices,
and diving behind a planter, she fights back.
This is bad, I'm being suppressed!
Mimi-senpai juts out her face from the flank.
She takes out the empty magazine of her AK-47.

[Misato]
"Sakura-san is nowhe〜re!"

[Taichi]
"Did you lose sight of her!"

[Misato]
"She is so agile..."
//As keeps returning. Except, in a while... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tsk... this looks bad."

Losing sight of an enemy is always bad.
And, Kiri sneaked around from the right side.
//I think he forgot a り　in there. -GHS
Very bad, we'll get pincered!
Kiri's M4-A1 Carbine breathed fire.

[Misato]
"Ah, I have been killed!"
//Since they're playing for "real" this time. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Shit!"

It's two against one.
I fall back as I return fire.
If I get in their pincer it's over.
Miki, on the flank, also worries me.
That instant, a muzzle was thrust in my back.

[Miki]
"'Holdo appu!'"
//Badly imitative. -GHS

Wh-, when did she...!
//See Youko. -GHS

[Miki]
"Game and set!"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, killed agaaain!"

[Miki]
"Yahoooy!"
[Miki]
"Victoryyy!"

Miki and Kiri go for a high-five.

[Taichi]
"This is the fourth defeat in a row... grrr!"

Club activities were going well.
......wait.
//This switch is unclear and very odd. It may just be that he's realizing this is all void, as CCC4005 hints, but there's much more that's odd here. See CCC3028: he has the same reaction when he notices Miki being too mature for what she should be. It may be he's noticing the same. The simplest explanation would be to contrast this script with CCC4006, then contrast the start of CCZAS with its second part. In the first, everyone's into the joke (and I wonder if it's been toned down not to look too off tone), in the second, the game is revealed. It's similar to what goes on in Week 1 vs. Week 2, though if the parallel is to be taken that way, then there's still plenty missing that's not revealed directly. -GHS
