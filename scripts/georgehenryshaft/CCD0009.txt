At a suitable time, I decided to take a break.
Eating sandwiches in the cafeteria,
and while eating, thinking.
A world of one week.
Inexplicably, no repulsion.
Because as far as I'm concerned, I think it a far
easier thing to live in than a world that
continues ahead forever.
//And here's the reason he likes the loop. How lucky for him that people's relationships never really improve or change, that Japan's been stuck in a decades-long rut, and that no one cares about this open-air prison. -GHS
Days that repeat over and over again...
Accidentally, a thought,
a damnable thought.
The yarn of this one week has been spun so many
times. Within that, is there no possibility that
all of us could be reconciled?
The unity of the eight of the Broadcast Club
is all broken up.
//Curious same term as used CCD0008E for the antenna. Given Tomoki, likely not a coincidence. -GHS
But even if I intend to be reconciled with
a single person, it isn't going to be simple.
//These have been the routes so far. -GHS
That is also something I have taken from
reading the diaries.
Suppose there is a way.
...I want to see it.

[Youko]
"Here, tea is served."
//And speaking of obstacles... -GHS

[Taichi]
...hmmm."
[Taichi]
"gLpgLpgLp... pwaaah! Cold'n'tasty, seconds pleeease!"

I hold out a plastic tumbler.
She who accepts the cup and wordlessly pours the contents of a canteen into it is Hasekura Youko, who was standing there.
//~realtime monologue~? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...don'tcha erase your presence."

[Youko]
"Why?"

[Taichi]
"Because you just suddenly coming to people's side is startling."
//See CCA0010. -GHS

[Youko]
"There's no particular erasing on my side. It's naturally like that."
//She's normally a ghost. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...anyone would be startled at being addressed abruptly."
//In Youko's bad behavior, he knows what he's doing wrong. -GHS

[Youko]
"Off guard?"
//A reminder that Youko, as we are repeatedly told, does not say more than what's needed to be understood... often by herself alone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah, because I wanna be off guard."

[Youko]
"Negligent?"

[Taichi]
"It just means I wanna live more leisurely!"

[Youko]
"...blasphemy."
//Religious term because crass channels is a bible games w0p w0p -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm tired. Of always being under this sharp mental strain."

[Youko]
"Making that the ordinary would be best, I think.
//See CCD1001. Interesting. -GHS
[Youko]
"Taichi simply has the bad habit of playing truant."
//With the mental strain... perhaps with school. -GHS

[Taichi]
"We will be through, permanently."
//See CCC4015. And this is how Taichi sees Youko. -GHS

[Youko]
"...I withdraw that, yes."

No quarrel break outs,
no bargaining comes to be,
no trouble occurs.
Only receiving, never giving.
There is no reciprocal interchange of the heart.

[Taichi]
"That feels like you're just loving a part of yourself, you know."
//NO SHIT. -GHS

[Youko]
"...wrong."

She's quick to understand,
yet she lets me have no understanding of myself.

[Youko]
"I just love you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...well, that's what you decided to do."

This became annoying.
Whatever I say she doesn't answer.
What if I were to inflict an effective attack on her?
//That "if" is no "if", of course, see CCD5001. -GHS
...a single solitary one?
It would be a tiny blade,
but it would certainly be her destruction.
//The point seems to be that, more than it being 'that' attack that destroys her, ANY successful attack would destroy her. Youko is strong like glass; she keeps pressure like nobody's business, but one good strike and she shatters. She's more Kiri-like that Kiri. -GHS
Youko-chan also knows of its existence.
That is why she is wary.
We live by playing a game that keeps us in reciprocal check.

[Taichi]
"Dammit all."

I chug down.
//The tea she gave him, the sandwiches come below. -GHS
Gulp.

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"...wanna sit?"

[Youko]
"...may I?"

[Taichi]
"Feel free to."

She snugly sits next to me.
I toss over half of the double portion of sandwiches.

[Youko]
"Thank you."

[Taichi]
"You just did these yourself anyway."

[Youko]
"Yes. Thank you."

[Taichi]
"..."

............

[Youko]
"How's the taste?"

[Taichi]
"It's delicious, dammit."

[Youko]
"Indeed."
[Youko]
"Here, tea."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, yeah..."

[Youko]
"This is fun, yes."

[Taichi]
"Is it nooow."

[Youko]
"Very much."

[Taichi]
"Well, but no problem."
//Empty words, empty verbiage, empty everything. -GHS

[Youko]
"But it would be good if we were to continue existing like this, like a phenomenon."
//Ahhh, earlier now. See CCD0021 for more. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Phenomenon?"

[Youko]
"Ever since a time, I had a thought."
//That "mukashi" that so often means "the Hasekura massacre". -GHS
[Youko]
"If I aim at the top, I will, eventually, reach God. And then, as God itself is Phenomenon..."
//This God is a single one and sits at the top, outside of time. At the most skeptical it could be said it's a monotheistic God completely compatible with the Christian one. Basically Youko wants to be God. Not delusional at all! -GHS

[Taichi]
"?"

[Youko]
"People will, someday, finally reach the horizon of physics, and set their aims on God, I think."
//It's so blatantly insane it almost bears no commenting. Considering the "horizon" (though metaphorical) of physics to be reachable is quite the failure of understanding what she's saying herself. Naturally, if God were to sit outside or above physics, not even reaching this horizon would allow humans to aim for Godhood. -GHS
[Youko]
"The means for that objective are, I would say, only one."

[Taichi]
"...welll, I don't get what you mean at all, no."

[Youko]
"As long as all sorts and all kinds of laws exist in there and remain eternally unchanging, the order of common-sense acts permitted from the beginning is not the outset, in other words, what humans do is not what brings about physics."
//That's a contorted and twisted way of saying it if I ever saw it. And it supplements, but not entirely gels, with CCD0021's concept of deterministic world made by choices. -GHS
[Youko]
"...it's only what is allowed."
[Youko]
"That is the upper limit."
//"Do what thou wilt is not the whole of the law" is a less confused way of putting it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Thus, the choice to become God does not exist on the vector of omnipotence and omniscience."
//That means you can't study yourself to Godhood, ergo God exists outside or at least beyond the ground rules of the universe. She's contradicting herself: that means humanity cannot reach this horizon of physics or set their aims on God, ever. Perhaps she thinks that's all she can do with the limited time given to her? -GHS
[Youko]
"Phenomenization and nothing else, that is the conclusion."
//This would make more sense if she defined what she means with the damn word in ways specific and understandable. CCD0021 is only vaguely clearer; best I can tell, she's talking about staying as a single point in history, ever unchanging. If my theory is correct, and the Cross World and its time loop are exclusively metaphorical, then Phenomenization is actually not possible and any attempt must be hallucination. Even then it fails: look at how leaky Taichi's 98 Game is, just this route. Even if phenomenization *appears* to be permitted, it's no more so than the flight that exists when one jumps off a building: it lasts only until the bottom is reached. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."
[Taichi]
"Ehhh, ahhh..."
//More Western-style filler words, see CCC4025. -GHS

I totally don't get this.

[Youko]
"Just the two of us, right?"
//The problems begin if Youko takes Taichi's game seriously. Always easier if she doesn't exist and is merely the side of him that holds on to the game most desperately, but... -GHS

Smiling gently, she pecked at a piece of ham that had stuck to the edge of the mouth.
//With her superlong tongue, the damn chameleon. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."

[Youko]
"Perfect reciprocal understanding of others, this idea of becoming as a colony, moving to a new Stage."
//Colony as in biology. More Stage stuff, see CCD5001 as well (for what sense THAT one makes). I think she means an even bigger codependency than the Alter Ego thing, which itself was impossible, so it's more nonsense. Either that, or as I suspect, the Stage is Taichi's chuuni. All the world's that. -GHS
[Youko]
"But... it's hollow, isn't it?"

[Taichi]
"...isn't it now."
//He's as confused as the reader should be. -GHS

[Youko]
"Suppose all humans throughout the world were to connect... even that would not create a god."
//Sometimes I can't tell when a character is rambling and when Tanaka is. Anyway, no gods from this hypothetical Perfect Connection Sorta-Collective Unconscious(?) Machine. -GHS
[Youko]
"But that may just be what saves these 'people', perhaps..."
//No gods from the connection, but perhaps a better humanity. Still sorta Collective Unconscious. -GHS
[Youko]
"Because as long as Taichi is there for me, I will be fine."

[Taichi]
"Well, it's an honor, but, yeah..."
//Whew, done! -GHS

Interchanges like this... however many we may repeat,
it is simply the mere tracing of the outline.
//NOW this makes sense. The above was just Youko rambling on incomprehensible, implausible and contradictory garbage without a glance at whether Taichi understands a word. This, at least, is very telling of their relationship. -GHS
And is that... what I do as well?
//Indeed, and it definitely shows who he learned it from. In fact, him describing his talks of this sort as "playing like a tape recorder" (see CCB0005) makes an interesting parallel with his rambles and his "conversations" with Nanaka. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, somehow we'll manage..."
