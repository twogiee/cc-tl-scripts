"Hoh..."

I tried going around in all sorts of ways.
Club is on Sunday.
I want for everyone to welcome the grand finale on the last day of this world together.
However... I felt the difficulty.
To sex all of us... no, wait, to see all of us reconciled, there is one biiig puzzle to solve.
//Wakan vs. wakai. After all, like all good Hentai Game Protagonists(tm), he Aims for the Harem Ending(tm). And that means orgy. That, or Tanaka totally wrote that word unconsexsexsexciously and "fixed" it this way because it was fusexnnier. -GHS
I head to the hokora.
A mass of notebooks.
An amount great enough that I could never read through all.
With Miki forced into copulation against her will (figuratively), Kiri spoils.
//You know what Japanese needed? Another word for "rape". -GHS
An increase in information is a very good thing,
but with an excessive increase, the time for accurate study vanishes.
//Which is why Taichi knows a lot of stuff... poorly. Also half of why this analysis doesn't involve translating the entire Materials Book, the Drama CD, or the After Story. Not that anything I've read there does anything but confirm my reading, but... -GHS
A dilemma.
I continued to rack my brains over it until the dead of night.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

A light appears from behind me.
//It can mean "there is", but also "it's turned on". She didn't need it at all to come here either? He has night eyes, they say, but she shouldn't. But if the two are the same and this is just Taichi taking the flashlight out of his bag and turning it on... -GHS
It's a flashlight.
And then, there was Youko-chan.
//That, or his subconscious/split personality turned the light on. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh... too bright..."

[Youko]
"Even those eyes you have will go bad if you read text."
//"at night" is conspicuously missing. Other alternative: it's not night at all, and that flashlight's high up in the sky. Also YES MOMS. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh... sorry."

[Youko]
"Have you made any discovery?"

[Taichi]
"None. It's like being endlessly stuck with a puzzle ring."

[Youko]
"So it is, how unfortunate."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan, these notebooks, do you..."

I begin to ask the question, then shut my mouth.
Should I really be relying on her?

[Taichi]
"Forget it. Let's go home."

I stand up.
For now, the notebooks stay shut away in the hokora.
I keep a number of them at hand. No more than I can read.

[Youko]
"...could we... go home together?"

[Taichi]
"When you're always, always keeping me under surveillance anyway!"

[Youko]
"I'm sorry..."
