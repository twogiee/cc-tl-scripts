I dreamed of Sakuraba pushing himself on me.
//HACK giant sakuraba RIGHT IN YOUR FACE TRYING TO RAPE YOU WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA -GHS

[Sakuraba]
『A MAN IS FINE TOO!』
//HACK out sakuraba (whew) -GHS

So shouts the gold-haired noble young man that's swooping down on me.
//More Pattern conflation: Taichi's the Aristocrat of Love. -GHS
Wait, isn't that weird?
Because at that time the guy wasn't blond.
//Referring back to the theater incident, which is before the blond Sakuraba. Not exactly sure what a first-time reader should make of this: maybe dream logic? blond, pushes him down, no longer blond. -GHS
But that's just whatever.
//Well, it's strong evidence that Taichi didn't have silver hair back when he was in the mansion, so whatever my full-width asterisk. -GHS
Sakuraba is equipped with a lance that can pierce any shield and a shield that can stop any lance, so from the very start he was never an opponent that could be reached through reason.
//HACK giant sakuraba in -GHS

[Sakuraba]
『IT'S CONTRACEPTIVE!』
//HACK out sakuraba -GHS

That's the justification-like thing he tells me as he approaches.
If Sakuraba was going to force carnal relationships while saying it's contraceptive, then I wanted to reject him from the very body.
//自体 means "himself" as in "Sakuraba himself", but the sarcastic undertone of the overliteral, as often in Tanaka, can't be missed. Taichi rejecting this Broken Sakuraba - who's himself in a similar Pattern to what Taichi has - is itself interesting, but there's more. I suppose the anti-gay message is sorta unsubtle, but the real point is the rejection of contraceptives as the excuse for sexual relationships. That's pretty damn Catholic, considering. -GHS
Why is this happening to me?
//He honestly wants you to marry his sister, though he could've foregone all that crap about the Chinese mafia really, but then certain metaphors might not have worked anymore. Anyway, the family's not about the incest but Mankind, put together by whims of the author (self-insertion mixed with god-figure, complete with having gone mad) and the Good Fortune that is still the God of Coincidences e.g. the Christian one. Hum, that'll need a new translation too, won't it. Crap. -GHS
Are the mean things I wrote in my diary?
//See CCA0012, exact same word that referred to what he did to Touko. Touko's name conspicuous in its absence. He was keeping a diary BEFORE his exchange diary with Yusa, meaning it's not his exchange with her that causes this. In short, Sakakibara is most the likely source. -GHS
Wrath of God?
Just recompense?
The Code of Hammurabi?
Aren't they only slightly different?
//Well, they are. I hope I don't need to make tedious explanations as to why the ancient Code of Hammurabi (and its refinement of Eye for an Eye) isn't metaphorically incompatible with a Christian Divine Retribution. -GHS
Whatever it may be, while I still know it's a dream that came from somewhere, I still slip into panic mode.
//HACK shake screen -GHS

[Taichi]
『My body, you caaan't!』
//HACK shake screen -GHS
[Taichi]
『Have mercy!』
//HACK shake screen -GHS
[Taichi]
『Animaaa〜l!』

And all that sort of shouts I make while I try to thrust Sakuraba's body away.
//This sounds so di--- oh. -GHS
A wrestling match with my chastity at stake.
...not that I'm chaste.
//See CCC0000... but also CCD0002. -GHS
My opponent is serious, so wildly snorting in excitement.
//Anger, sexual excitement... also Yutaka's sneer. -GHS
There's some serious thoughts of murder here.
//Ambiguous as to from whom, if I got the sneer thing right it should be obvious why: Sakuraba's transitioning into Yutaka. -GHS
Strikes that go thunk, thunk.
//HACK shake screen -GHS
One of them is a skillful clean hit.
//See CCA0002 -GHS
Sakuraba flips over.
Supine, his sense lost, Sakuraba's nethers unconsciously discharged.
While I thought whether he'd ejaculate, from the pointed tip of Sakuraba's Charged Particle Cannon (self-named) out blows a bundle of flowers, as in a magician's trick.
//Yutaka's fallen down the stairs, he thought he was dead, but whoops, he just hurt his leg and lost his memories. And here's die Zubkonshous cenZoring it. -GHSigmund
Aw.
What a development in bad taste.
//HACK fade to black -GHS
I cover my eyes.
//HACK return -GHS
And that was when I was awake.
//Literally means to just wake up, of course; but the kanji for "eye" and the one usually used in the verb "memorise" are of course pointers to major portions of the story. Stuff like "I remembered my eyes" sounds too silly, besides being technically incorrect, and this kind of sentence is too minor for that kind of overadaptation anyway, so I'm going with something that just sounds a little off. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...way too surreal."

Besides, I wouldn't expect that guy to have the pluck to push himself on somebody.
//See CCA0011A. -GHS
He's a fainthearted obou-chan.
//His molestations towards the ojou-san would get punished by her male counterpart, even if it's in a double-nested dream. -GHS
But if I have to have one, I wish it was a dream where I'm reverse-raped by Misato-senpai.
//This was before the nickname then? But so was CCA0027, which is odd. -GHS
Misato 『...this nasty little meat has gotten so very big, that I cannot but punish it most thoroughly with this whip!』
//Miyasumi Misato is dead. Witness the birth of rape demon Misato!!! Seriously, Misato the Rape Demon just doesn't work. Except, thematically... -GHS
Way too awesome...
I change my clothes while still spellbound.
//HACK started song earlier again. -GHS
Breakfast had been prepared,
and there was also a note.
            『Eat properly and have a nice day』
//This is likely intended to fit with the passive-aggressive, weirdly written notes by Youko. Pretty interesting that the two would share this habit. Well, more like convenient to the point of it being inordinately suspicious. -GHS
Beautiful career woman Mutsumi-obasan is also good at cooking.
She's so busy that she's almost never home, though.
//This is pretty normal in Japan; not for the host families of a know psychopath, however. -GHS
I bow my head to that.
Presuming upon her kind offer, I wash down a thick sandwich with some vegetable juice.
//Wait a second 分厚い !!!MUTSUMI'S SANDWICHES ARE SAKAKIBARA'S DIARY AND HE JUST ATE THEM NOOOOOO!!! but seriously, Mutsumi's sandwiches seem few, while Youko's many. She also doesn't provide drinks, meaning CCA0004 should be Youko, again making sense of him visiting Tasaki. -GHS
I don't have time.
//But he wakes up so regularly, and Yusa's just about to leave...? -GHS
I pack back the leftovers in the wrapping and put them into my pocket.
//No bag, few leftovers. -GHS
I'll eat on the way.
The rays of the sun assert themselves with brilliance.
This starts all the way from morning.
I feel depressed.
//Here I got nothing. Maybe he just hates the sunlight. I sure do *current time 2AM* -GHS
And after I've been walking for a while,

[Sakuraba]
"Ah'gyarooooooooow!!!"
//8xー -GHS

That's Sakuraba's scream.
It's relatively near.
The howl of a dog further overlaps the scream.
And then they fade away.

[Taichi]
"I get it..."

I was satisfied.
//The puzzle solved, he loses interest. -GHS
Then, right there---

[Girl]
"Oh my? Taichi-san?"
//Oddly, not Senpai. He probable talked her into this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'Morning."

[Girl]
"Ah, good morning, yes!"

She bows her head with a sharp bob.
This is Yusa-chan, the beautiful young girl that leaves near me.
//She lives on the other side of the road from him, technically. For the curious, she dropped the second 'u' because when she transferred from Upper Misaka she decided to eliminate all 'u'gly things (sorry, but the Higurashi joke is irresistible). -GHS
Nice town Kamisaka.
Yusa-chan, so cute it doesn't require exposition, held a loaf of curry bread swaying in her hands.
//HACK remove doll as per console version -GHS
The two of us line up and set out to walk.
It's not really something that began today,
//Trollsplanation as to why this didn't happen the day before. -GHS
it's because the two of us are going towards the same school anyway.
From behind us I could hear a 『Habe a nice daaaaaaaay!』 in a husky voice.
That is Yusa-chan's mother.
//Somewhat polite, though not haha-ue-sama. First-time readers could be thinking that she is the one making him dinner. -GHS
She's sort on the heavy side,
//Suuuper important. -GHS
but it's all fine, since she lets me have something enjoyable every day.
//Same as above, the food, not just Yusa. -GHS
A beautiful girl that was born to a family this mediocre...
If I had to find a just one blemish in her, it'd be that she is completely clueless of all things worldly.
As the most familiar Senpai of opposite sex to little Yusa-chan, the responsibility given me is no little thing.

[Yusa]
"I am going ooout!"

She returns a wave of the hand, on her face not a shadow of that rebellious age.
//As in adolescence. -GHS
Far from it, as it appears we're also at a time where even her primary sexual characteristics might not be there yet.
//HACK NVL mode. This is actually always left split in all version, which is just... wow, what the hell were they thinking?! This is Taichi's superficial mud-throwing in a single sentence! -GHS
Regardless of how the want to thoroughly dye a
snow white canvas of one's rough color is a most
thoroughly natural thing to have for a man We
are however conscious that repeatedly experiencing
thoughts that endlessly sway with ardentness and
furthermore seductiveness on the brink of whether
to also stain with Our delusions the purity of a
dazzle so far greater than a precious gem's that
is possessed by this innocent third-tallest first
year middle-grade dish so faltering in remembering
her keigo named Yusa-chan or to refrain from such
is itself something that more pertains to a crazed
pedophile.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Seriously, We are.
//Moved it here, better effect. -GHS
Well, for now they're swaying.
Yes, just like that bag of curry bread that Yusa-chan has in her hands.
//His sexual delusions are swaying just like the symbol of Christianity held by a pure child that is actually quite filthy inside. Pshaw, Cross Channel is so obvious. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Isn't that curry bread?"
//HACK make the doll fade in instead of snapping in -GHS

[Yusa]
"It is!"

With each step a sway, back and forth, back and forth.
//Thought and bread. -GHS
As if being cradled by a ghost, the sway nothing but a manifestation of its existence.
//Still about the sway of the bread AND his thoughts. The ghost is Nanaka, the Holy Spirit, who is hinting that his delusions are uhm, no, wait, Nanaka IS in his delusions so the two sway the same, though if there's a sway you gotta bring in Youko, because the sway gotta be between two points right?, so it's between Youko and Nanaka (Eve and Mary in Christian symbolism), whether Youko exists or not, which is another loaf of bread. Uhm, horrid sex joke that implies overfamiliarity with rape nukige here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is that... breakfast?"

[Yusa]
"Uhm, Sakuraba-san was there earlier."

[Taichi]
"Yep, was is the word."

[Yusa]
"Did you meet him?"

[Taichi]
"No, there was some evidence left."

[Yusa]
"Evidence?"

[Taichi]
"Well, by the time I came around he wasn't among us anymore."
//Ah, what a world of difference a bit of tone makes. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Oh, what a problem."
[Yusa]
"I thought I would give him this curry bread."

Seems like she was going to feed the wild animal to train it to human contact.
//More importantly, Yusa is already learning to (over) feed people, like her own mother, who is the likely source of the bread anyway. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's because Combat hates that guy."

[Yusa]
"That ferocious dog Combat, at Yoshida-san's house?"

[Taichi]
"That guy's awesome. He can uproot the wedge where his chain is fastened on his own."
//With the chain and all. Keep this absolutely irrelevant detail about an absolutely irrelevant non-character that is only ever mentioned two more times in the entire VN well in mind. -GHS
[Taichi]
"When that guy wants to leave he leaves, when he wants to return he returns."
//This and what follows is pretty much a description of Taichi. -GHS

[Yusa]
"But Combat doesn't normally attack people!"

[Taichi]
"And a true gangster is exactly that sort."
//Gokudou is also a cinema genre in Japan. More material for the Settei, I guess. -GHS

[Yusa]
"True... gangster...?"

[Taichi]
"Today his physique has improved, but the blood of soldiers flows inside that guy."
//Because he ate soldiers and his owner is Adolph Hitler. Waitasec oh crap I can't find the name of Marmaduke's owners in Japanese... whoa I just realized what I was trying to do, NVM. -GHS
[Taichi]
"To put it in human terms, I'd say he's sort of like a good ol' criminal boss having returned home from the war."
//IOW, it's Taichi. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Yet he only ever attacks Sakuraba."

[Yusa]
"That's inexplicable."

[Taichi]
"Inexplicable it is."
//Maybe Sakuraba should not try to push him down wailing "a dog is fine too! it's contraceptive!". -GHS

We walk at a leisurely pace.
//Weren't they nearly late? -GHS

[Yusa]
"What will I do with this..."
[Yusa]
"Would you be hungry, maybe?"

[Taichi]
"Wanna eat half each?"
//And his sandwich...? -GHS

[Yusa]
"Yes!"

The two of us ate the curry bread.
//No protests? Shouldn't be the bread from the cafeteria then. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You fitting in at school?"

[Yusa]
"Well, a bit."
//No definite "yes". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bullying?"

[Yusa]
"None there is none! I'm so lucky!"
//Conversely, an oddly direct straightforward answer. She might be lying through her teeth. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ain't that nice."

Gunjou Institute the lone in the world. A first-rate Gunjou this is.
//Should be a reference to how what we just saw was part of Yusa's ultramarine... -GHS

[Taichi]
"If anything bad happens, gladden me by feinting with something like, 'I know a looot of people in classes above that will payback you!'."
//...odd he'd give this suggestion otherwise, since according to CCC3007, there's no bullying. I'm sure what the Newspaper Club did to Sakuraba in CCA0002 wasn't bullying either, nor is what Taichi does bullying at all, and not just according to Kiri, although I would suspect shooting upperclassmen with crossbows is sort of a bullying, in a sense. IOW, it's a load. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Yes!"

She looks hyper happy.

[Yusa]
"But really, I don't say things like 'will payback you'..."
//"De sumasu" means sort of what I adapted above, while "-desumasu" tossed at the end of the sentence sounds like a really bad moe affectation. See CCC4022 when it returns, copied off by Miki, so it's gotta be visible. Given below and how she phrases it, I suspect this was got her bullied. Also see CCD0008D, when he teases Touko on her own affectations, which she never come up either. Although not visible here, he also used 'atashi' in the sentence above, which isn't the pronoun Yusa uses. -GHS

Shyness.

[Taichi]
"Hah hah hah!"

There's this resentfulness due to having been bullied some time ago.
//That "long ago" will soon mean "the Hasekura incident", meaning this is Taichi equally as Yusa. It's half the explanation for his grudge against Yutaka. Culprit vague even if it wasn't, as Yusa may well have been bullied (and likely still is) by others, at the very least back when she had taken the test, as Kiri and Touko were. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Homeroom teacher's Sakakibara-sensei, right?"
//Oddly enough, although 榊 looks like tree-altar-humbly say in most fonts I tried, it's actually written tree-god (which is what it means). This threw me off, as in the console versions that's much more obvious. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"He's a good teacher! You're in luck."

Hobby's Bishoujo Figurines so he's sorta near the end, tho.
//And maybe that's why he chuunis in the diary (that's not grammatically incorrect, chuuni is a verb I've decided now). -GHS

[Yusa]
"Ahah ahah, thanks!"
[Yusa]
"...everybody in my class gives it all they have, so they can have fun with me!"
//"everybody in class is living to their hardest, so I enjoy myself" + "everybody in class is doing their damnest to make fun of me". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Do they now."

[Yusa]
"Mommy's also always trying to help me."
//Overprotective, LOUD, plays favorite, works at the cafeteria where the meal tickets are limited... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Isn't she."
[Taichi]
Ah, but when things get tough that woman truly stands out. Well, Yusa-chan, yours is a life of peace!"
//fat joke^2, that hides how her mom is not exactly a subtle presence at Gunjou. -GHS

[Yusa]
"And then... uhm..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Yusa]
"The teacher had us do exchange diaries..."

[Taichi]
"I had that too class too, long ago."
//Definitely why he keeps the diary. Odd 'long ago' now. -GHS

Homeroom Exchange, was it.

[Taichi]
"Me, I didn't really find anyone in my class, so I did it with someone from a higher grade."
//He had this in first year middle school, possibly second, meaning the upperclassman was Youko. Who might not exist. Not that Sakakibara would care, if only because he's chuunin' it like nobody's business with those figurines, at least. Alternative is that he did this in third year with Misato, but that's a little odd given that's just the previous year, even considering how Taichi's memories and sense of time are not exactly reliable. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Ah, I did not find anyone either!"
//With everyone having sooo much fun in her class? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Yusa]
"We are an odd number in class."
//That's not an explanation. Anyone could've been left out. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... so, how about the teacher?"

[Yusa]
"No, see, it is this here."

With a rustling, she takes out a notebook from inside her bag.
//She doesn't use it as padding. Yes, the Signature Exchange Diary is very similar to this. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Taichi-san, couldn't I entrust you with this?"

A neon-green notebook,
a faint scent of mint.
//Mint returns. Taichi seems to really like it, the smell fetishist. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah! I'll do it!"

I shout with both fists thrust in the air.

[Yusa]
"..."

[Taichi]
"What's the problem, little girl?"
//There goes the Prince of Atlantis... -GHS

[Yusa]
"Ah, eh, uhm... is this alright? You don't want to think on this more?"
//More suspect: she does NOT expect him to do this, i.e., she reflexively expects him to reject her. She expects him to not like her, or at least, to only tolerate her. This is a fixed behavior that speaks of past traumas. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Unnecessary."

[Yusa]
"So quickly..."
//She absolutely expected to have to try to convince him, and likely to fail. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This notebook is the diary? You already wrote the first entry, right?"
//Because he uses Bulky Diary Notebooks of suspect consequences now...? -GHS

[Yusa]
"Ah, yes! About lots and lots."

[Taichi]
"Lots and lots?"

The lots and lots of a pretty girl with insufficient sexual characteristics.
This really bad sequence of words easily drives me mad.
But in front of Yusa-chan I must put up a front, even if only a little bit, so as not to be disliked.
//See CCD1001B for the exact nuance. THIS is what she's about to react to! -GHS
The name I give to it is, The Waterloo of Rationality.

[Taichi]
"I'm looking forwards to that!"

I sweep my bangs with a 'fwasah'.
//The sound of the wind. Damn I regret not using that 'bluffing'. -GHS
The maiden's gaping pours fixed on Our snowy mane.
//Hideously purple. Remember CCA0012; purple = nukige. This is NOT going to make him look cooler if she gets him, and she does! -GHS
When I come to notice, my hair or maybe my face were stared at intently.
//Shift is intentional. Notice the apparent redundancy: that "when I come to notice" is nearly commented on in CCX0001, meaning he just gotten off automation. Was she actually looking at him in the previous sentence? Certainly, she is looking at how odd he must be looking at this moment. -GHS
Now that I think of it, there was once a prince that appeared in a Co**lt novel that I'm sure was handsome despite his snow-white hair.
//Want to 'censor' it as C****t, but it obviously reads cunt. I know it's three and a half letters too many, but most people can't count. Hum, a certain Yoshida Midori is published under them... -GHS
So much passion around that one.
//"She told me all excited" (she reads the novels, see CCA0020) + "he spoke passionately" + "the tale was passionate". Besides -GHS
Well then, I should have that same princely image myself, right?
//Depression as he knows his facade won't work. But what could Yusa be thinking of this? -GHS
That'd be great wouldn't it...
Naaah... with my face... ain't happening...
In the end, this'll never be more than a wish of mine.

[Yusa]
"It is a bit embarrassing..."
//The entries, or what he's doing? -GHS

[Taichi]
"I would never laugh about things written seriously!"

[Yusa]
"..."

Oh, this one was worth lots of points wasn't it?
I made Miki too much of a mimidoshima, gave her too much superficial knowledge about the world, so I sorta failed that one.
//Crap, doesn't google. Since Miki takes Taichi's chuuni altogether too seriously, this is very important. -GHS
She quickly split through my actions and found the real motives on the bottom.
//Visuals. OK, Miki splitting Taichi's bottom may not be the best, but at least it's not yet jokes about Taichi's inevitable yearning for the curry filling of Sakuraba's br-GHS
And now, I've been turned into just her playmate.
//遊 vs 遊紗, not played too hard (see CCA0027), but there it is. More importantly it's again how Miki's seen through his chuuni stuff and is playing with him. And more of what a Great Experiment and Evil and Stuff he's performing on people, although if one takes Miki to be  -GHS
Fuck!
//ner. No, seriously, original can also mean "I'm so jealous" pretty much as obviously as "fuck" here can mean "I wanted to have actual sex with her". -GHS
If I return my thoughts on that, my regret will be proportional to that return!
//Not only does it merge with the 'jealousy' thing (Miki was NTR'd by Kiri), but it's also well into the theme of memories. The more he remembers... -GHS
But this time I swear I'll make it go well, and with luck, it'll end up as a full-course feast of the overtures of a beautiful maiden with emphasis on the maiden (meaning unclear).
//Term means both "women's advances" and "meal set before me", see CCD0021. The "make things go well" is just the cherry on top. Meaning clarified! -GHS
Rationality, rationality! Gentlemanly, gentlemanly!
//The mask, such as it is, is slipping. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then is it fine if I take this, fr{a}ulein?"
//More formal than his average, but not purple. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Frow line?"
//See CCD4003. Original means "does not take baths". Only really plays in that one script, though Taichi being dirty will be a running gag. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Summer Whoops."

I spat out words of admonishment with Everlasting Summer specs towards my self who unconsciously made use of a difficult word.
//Specs/way, see CCX0001. Yeah, OMFG HARD KANJI's: The Sentence. The time loop is the eternal reward for him spewing this kind of sewage unconsciously: he knows. Term turns up in the Tale of Genji too, so see CCA0020. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That means a cute young lady."

Gently the girl's tears get wiped off.
//Intentionally ambiguous. -GHS

[Yusa]
"What is it? Was there something in my eyes?"
//Rev 21:4. He may have a really big trunk in his eyes, but... -GHS

She wasn't crying.

[Taichi]
"It means a lovable young lady."
//Still that frow line. Pattern Interruptus, he's skipping. *record scratch* that means computers with chuuni MWI act like records! -GHS

[Yusa]
"Eh..."

I calmly restore our boundaries.
//He knows he went too far. -GHS
Expressions vanished from Yusa-chan's face as if washed off.
And then, the color of embarrassment that is as red as a rose in the full of its bloom dyed her face--- naught.
//Purple and silly. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Bwakhaah!"
//Ah, there's the Sneeze That Means Stuff. ぐじゅん gujun literally means "stupid/dumb", and is written with the kanjis 愚 foolish and 純 pure. The timing puts this as an allergic reaction to Taichi. Now it's BAKAAA because Japaneyse translations-desu. See CCC0025 for the reading key. -GHS

Out came a sneeze,
//くしゃみ kushami, sneeze, reminds sort of gujun, doesn't it? That's the coverup. This is intended to not be looked at seriously without the reading key. -GHS
a dirty, soiling sneeze.

[Yusa]
"Ah, shorry... ah!"

The peach-pink purity-tinged sigh that one unconsciously vents on rubbing the sensitive parts had absolutely nothing in common with that last 'ah'.
It was a tiny exclamation of surprise caused by the subject of the girl's fixed gaze.
The gap between me and Yusa-chan was spanned by a bridge.
One side was on my uniform, in the precise middle of my abdomen,
//Right above his dick. -GHS
the other side on Yusa-chan's nose.
In short,

[Yusa]
"Wha, whaD?"
//Clogged nose. -GHS

it was a snot bridge.
This high-viscosity fluid had, with a
-streeeeiaaatch-
//slightly icky-fied, matches original better. -GHS
dangled a suspension bridge between us.
This is my inference.
//Begin Scientific Trolls! -GHS
On the very downbeat of the sneeze, the launched glob of mucus fired onto to my uniform with a nuzzle velocity superior to even that of the Shinkansen (no, seriously).
//Only laterally a musical reference, but it's close enough to keep. Sneezes aren't anywhere near the order of magnitude of that speed, see Mythbusters. -GHS
This mightily adhesive fluid was drawn by the fired bullet and dragged from the girl's nasal cavity, and this connection that normally would break had fortunately held, thus completing the bridge.
//This is not severance; this is a connection. The 'idiot' above wasn't in reaction to his ulterior motives, but to his dressup! Notice that 'luck': it's still God, which further returns to why Sakuraba was made into the reading key, as it's the same connection that there exists with him and Taichi - remember the stage. -GHS

[Yusa]
"......"

And it seems that, at last, Yusa-chan has also understood the event.
The color in her face grows pale.
She does not make one movement.
No, she cannot make one.
For this too young maiden's very own nasal discharge had, on a boy of the opposite gender... specifically a most excellent aristocratic boy with a strong sense of honor (self-delusion)... performed a thorough uniform bukkake.
* One of these parts is expressed inappropriately.
//Technical term, which ironically isn't bukkake in Japanese. -GHS
If this is handled tactlessly,
//HACK dim screen -GHS
                    『Princess Cumnose!』
//Consider Taichi's nickname was Ichiko. -GHS
                      『Cumnose-chan!』
//HACK back to normal -GHS
and many other extremely infantile, cruelty-filled titles are very likely to be bestowed to her.
//Whether she is bullied or not, this could likely be enough to trigger Step One of the Pattern. Notice that he immediately assumes that Gunjou, with its No Bullying, actually HAS bullying? -GHS
Children constantly seek targets to ridicule,
//He means children that aren't necessarily at the age of children, I would suspect. Yutaka was more or less a child, but it's enough to go to any Internet forum to see this hideous behavior. -GHS
the weaker they are, the more the ridicule.
Constantly, just constantly.

[Yusa]
"Aw... ah, this... uhm...!"

I wouldn't know if it's because of the extreme mental strain,
but her pupils, eyes still wide open, in a single instant were overflowing with tears.
This is bad!
Planting new psychological traumas in this poor girl is out of the question.
It was all down to this stunningly beautiful snow-maned prince of Atlantean descent.
//He gets all the chicks at Hogwarts plus he's from space with space powers and also now an official part of the Sonic comicverse so he totally can appear in your fanfics. Next, five paragraphs of ghastly descriptions of clothes (his medalliAn looks like it's made of metOl, but it's actually LEDs) and a random change of setting while leaving current events dangling and unresolved forever. -GHS
Faster than the girl could lose her mind, I calmly produce a handkerchief.
//See CCC0025. "Lose her mind", naturally, meant altogether too literally. -GHS
With it I first cover Yusa's nose.
//No honorific. -GHS

[Yusa]
"...nmyu?"

She makes a weird voice.
I tear apart the root then, alternating the clean spots on the hanky, wipe the subnasal so many times.
After that comes the collection of the snot bridge while very carefully wiping down my own uniform.
I return the hanky to pocket. And as I try,

[Yusa]
"Ah, you can't, you can't do that!"

[Taichi]
"Hmm?"

[Yusa]
"It's di-di-di-dirty, ah, you can't, must throw it away, ah, uhm!"
//What comes from inside her is filthy. A normal reaction, but not in this circumstance. -GHS
[Yusa]
"I'll reimburse it!"

[Taichi]
"It's fine."

So I say with a bright smile.

[Taichi]
"Well, shall we go?"

[Yusa]
"But I said, that's, so sorry, your handkerchief!"

This time I can indeed wipe her tears with the belly of my thumbs.
//But was it accidental, or did her own Internal Demon set this up? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Leaving a cute Kouhai in trouble is not worth a handkerchief."

[Yusa]
"...!!!"

That struck her greatly.

[Taichi]
"Reimburse is no problem, but you'd better watch out for colds, Yusa-kun."
//Intentional mis-honorific. He normally doesn't use -kun period, and it tends to come out when he's in sort of a panic. IOW, he's not all quite there right now. -GHS

Tok, I gently give her a light poke on the face, and resume walking.
Yusa-chan stood dumbfounded.

[Taichi]
"Hey, to school, ojou-san!"

[Yusa]
"...ye-..."
[Yusa]
"Yes!"

She comes over at half run.

[Yusa]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

She grabbed my hand.
Her face is cast downwards, vivid red up to her ears.
//Easier to see in Japanese, but the OMFG HARD KANJI's have been continuing for a while. This should perhaps be even more overwrought. -GHS
So damn adorable. Just because of that little thing!
I didn't think the the goodwill of this girl that I made all mine with a single handkerchief to be particularly cheap,
//See CCZAS, this is the "shoot dead" used there for the Cross World. -GHS
but simultaneously wanting for this girl to birth me a baby with all her heart meant my brain was rotten, and no mistake. Die, just die.
//As usual, he is not kidding. -GHS
