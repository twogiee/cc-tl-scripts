On returning from the toilet,
I had a random encounter with Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"Tomokiiiiii."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Wahahah, we're totally cutting classes! You can just feel the uniqueness of the world that is a school corridor while classes are in session!"

[Tomoki]
"It's pointless, just drop it..."
//Look at that, it's totally afterschool! -GHS

Tomoki's downhearted.

[Taichi]
"We're just revving those engine these days, us young boys."
//Still the driving metaphor, it'll get a bit more use in this route. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Easygoing aren't you, Taichi."
[Tomoki]
"Now I can never read how Psychoman continues no more."
//It ends with "they all lived happily ever after, except the non-Christians (sorry, but you were warned)". -GHS

A parched laugh.

[Tachi]
"...so it seems."

Now I can't read ahead of Tomoki and spoil him anymore.

[Tomoki]
"So, school, what'cha dying to do here?"
//nani SHINI gakkou ni... -GHS

FSZ 17
{}Taichi: "As a possessor of an Innocence License, for the purpose of acting out the sensitive and brittle heart of a teenager that was left behind in this world, I am going to depict that nihility of the soul that I should perhaps better call its automatic module via the repetition of the ordinary routine that is a commute to school."
//Surface: "I'm going to show how desperate I am by continuing to do what I was doing before despite circumstances changing significantly", deeper: "I know this nonexistent mankind is all an act and I'm just repeating things to pretend it isn't". Continuing the Fixed and Automatic allegories, as well as how VN characters continue to act the same way despite routes changing and stuff. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That's an idea that's all slave of a teenager's radicalist module."
//"It's all chuunibyou, dude". -GHS
[Tomoki]
"There's still lots of Hot Blooded Koshien-kun out there, you know."
//"People still exist damn you". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_baseball_in_Japan seems to be taken in contrast to the revolutionaristicoid pretentious pseudo-nihilism of above (and more). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, but among those of us who use words such as 'postmodern', they would not be considered as humans with any observational worth."
//"I am so damn pretentious I'm acting as if certain people don't exist", with "oh wait there's no one anymore" as the implied subtext, but being actually a double troll. -GHS

Flapping wave of the hand.

[Tomoki]
"Ahahahahah, you can say that!"
//"I know you're trolling, hahahaha". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahah, can I!"

Black humor.
Sharp-tongued Tomoki's favorite.
//"The favorite of Tomoki, who's sharp-tongued" + "I prefer Tomoki when he's sharp-tongued". Of course, Tomoki's no harmless young boy... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Haven't laughed thanks to you in a while, Taichi."
//A little bit off... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Very glad to be up to the task."
[Taichi]
"How's club going?"

[Tomoki]
"Thanks to the non-participation of the Great King of Foodsnatchers, fine."

[Taichi]
"...hahahaaah."

That would be me.

[Tomoki]
"I think I'll hit your place tomorrow, Taichi."
//...but he comes just later? Maybe he just changes plan, or maybe it's just a plot hole. Doesn't seem very important. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Roger. Thanks."

[Tomoki]
"No prob'."
[Tomoki]
"Friendship demands..."

[Taichi]
"Nothing in return."

A lively exchange with a sweltering smile, white teeth, and raised thumb.

[Tomoki]
"That reminds me..."
[Tomoki]
"Are you going to go to club?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, being the Great King of Foodsnatchers means my participation was rejected wasn't it... by you."

[Tomoki]
"Nah, I don't mean mine."

Words stagnate but for a moment.

[Tomoki]
"...the one on the rooftop's."
//you mean the friendly ghosts who want to establish a yuritopia? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, Mimimi-senpai's!"
[Taichi]
"Ah, I ain't really showing up... many reasons."

[Tomoki]
"Right..."
[Tomoki]
"Well, that should be for the best, should it."
[Tomoki]
"...best, yes."

Turning his back to me, Tomoki departs.
Quite an odd behavior we had here.
What could've happened?
