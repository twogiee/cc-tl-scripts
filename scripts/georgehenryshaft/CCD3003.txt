I am awake.

//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
Sunlight was piercing through the window.
Seems I have been hard asleep. I did not have any dreams.
The time is... 7AM.
Going to school is necessity.
Kiri was standing in the corridor.

[Taichi]
"Yo!"
//The script numbering for the voices here are all over the place. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...Senpai."

The expression on her face had a trace of warning coloration.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism <- superpower? -GHS
On Tuesday, things will go like this.
Her gaze is full of animosity.
I avert my eyes.
Nothing provocative comes out of my mouth.
Miki came out.
//Of the closet. -GHS

[Miki]
"Oh my, Senpai!"
[Miki]
"A most delicious meal, yesterday's."
[Miki]
"Go on, Kiri, you too."

[Kiri]
"...I did..."

[Miki]
"...eat, didn't you."

[Kiri]
"Yes, but... yes, but."

Internal discord,
generated by pride.

[Taichi]
"Fiiine, it's fiiine, it wasn't something I made anyway."

[Miki]
"It wasn't?"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan did."

[Miki]
"Ahhh, that would be Senpai's Lovemon gal, right."
//Koremon. http://zokugo-dict.com/10ko/koremon.htm according to this, it means "look at the finger gesture", or, often, "yakuza". Although not quite what seems to be the norm, she raises a pinky next, so I suppose she means lover. But see CCA0027, where she also mentions the Yakuza sorta off-flow when it comes to Taichi; she might still know that Taichi and Youko aren't like that, and that the Hasekuras may well be a Yakuza family. -GHS

She raised a pinky.
//Girlfriend, see. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Maybe 'Lovemon', or maybe '****mon'. She's a Monster of convenience, indeed."
//Youko is Taichi's pocket monster. That, for the uninitiated, still means his dick. Yes, Pokemon is about masturbation. You read it here first! And don't get me started in the pro-obesity messages of stories such as "bye-bye butterfree..." -GHS

So dangerous copyright-wise.
//There's always copyright-infringing stuff about Miki... also, damn the Japanese have this emotional attachment to their mons that it's like they're playing Outcast en masse. (PS2: "my untiring battle continues---" "But I digress") -GHS

[Taichi]
"Annnd on that topic, here, have breakfast."

[Miki]
"Eh... are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"'s fine. 'Cause me, I don't really like sandwiches after all."
//It's possibly even true, see the thing about witches in CCD2002. Youko probably never even asked. -GHS

[Miki]
"That's too bad then."

[Taichi]
"Gotta be a pain to only have sweets and junk food and the like."
//Given how he DOES carry sweets around, this might as well refer to him as well. -GHS

[Miki]
"...yes."

Kiri comes to wedge herself in,
and with challenge in her intonation, she demands:

[Kiri]
"Do you have an objective in doing all this?"

[Taichi]
"...an objective, yes I do."

[Kiri]
"And that would be?"

[Taichi]
"...I have something I want to talk to you about, Kiri."

[Touko]
"With me?"

[Taichi]
"Just, there is an appropriate day for this talk. Until that time, do keep in good spirits."

[Miki]
"An appropriate day?"

[Taichi]
"Yup, so stay waitin'."

I turned away.

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

[Miki]
"Th-, thank you for the food, Senpai!"

All I pointed towards the back was a hand, which I waved in a flutter.
I wasted time until noon.
Having excessive contact and being struck by some unforeseen tragedy is out of the question.
This Eigenself of mine, this me as I am now endowed with this knowledge and this experience, cannot be allowed to die.
//But see CCC4021. The difference is that he'll allow himself to grow. He doesn't want to forget; he doesn't want to just never go on ahead. -GHS
At noon, once again to school.
Here, the two will be eating their lunch... probably.
If they are not there eating I'll redo this. I'll see them next week.
I will redo this again, however many times it takes.
And then---

[Taichi]
"...without any food, are you?"

[Miki]
"We do, but..."

[Taichi]
"Whose lunchbox is that?"

[Miki]
"Kiri made that."
//Mistagged as a dupe, it isn't. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoa, nice innit."

[Kiri]
"...there is no part of it for Senpai."

Plainly.

[Taichi]
"Isn't there a fair amount?"

[Miki]
"There's a lot indeed."

It's obvious this could be enough for three people.

[Kiri]
"However for some reason there is none for Senpai."

[Taichi]
"...mngh."
[Taichi]
"Theeen let's transact bit of a barter."

[Miki]
"A trade you mean."

[Taichi]
"Hard candy and gummy candy. Handmade."

The eyes of the two opened very wide.

[Miki]
"Made by hand?"

[Taichi]
"Mh-hm. By Youko-chan though."
[Taichi]
"Sugar in moderation may be good for maintaining an attractive body shape. Gummies are Konjac, 'course. 0 calories."

[Both]
"0 CALORIES?!"
//Women. -GHS

............

[Taichi]
"Weeee."

Barter concluded.

[Miki]
"It's like your mommy used to make..."

[Kiri]
"Just like."

[Miki]
"Milky isn't it."

[Kiri]
"Isn't it."

[Taichi]
"Tastes like stalker though."

[Miki]
"My cheeks... my schmiling cheeks..."

[Kiri]
"Mhhh〜〜〜!"

[Taichi]
"Delicious... you got talent for cooking, Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"...side dishes are retort pouch however."

[Taichi]
"Still delicious."

[Kiri]
"If I didn't make anything, Miki would only ever eat junk food."

[Miki]
"Buuut..."

[Taichi]
"Seems we are all having our problems with our diets."

[Miki]
"Yes..."
//And this is untagged. Rush job indeed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, let's get married!"

[Kiri]
"That is not possible."

[Miki]
"Not a 'I do not want to', Senpai, it seems it's all the way to impossibility!"

[Taichi]
"...I was burnt."

[Kiri]
"A cold water shower, then?"

[Taichi]
"That'd be a problem."

[Miki]
"Are there any more sweets?"

[Taichi]
"There are. Got biscuit, got sable'... all thanks to how skilled Youko-sensei is at making sweets."

[Miki]
"...that's unexpected."

[Taichi]
"Seems she got good at making preserved food."

[Kiri]
"...are you two lovers?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, we've just lived together, nothing more."

[Miki]
"Sharing the house."

[Kiri]
"Sharing the house."

The two harmonized.

[Taichi]
"Sharing the house is wrong."
[Taichi]
"Because we don't have parents, the two of us were being graciously hosted by that family."

I explained with efficiency.
//AKA "see CCC0031B" -GHS

[Miki]
"So that is how it was."

[Kiri]
"...and I was thinking it was a really suspicious relationship..."

[Miki]
"Hasekura-senpai is a woman of many mysteries, she is."

[Taichi]
"Damn if she ain't."
[Taichi]
"Well then, here's some special Thousand-Year Candy, so we can sink into that Shichi-Go-San ambiance!"

[Miki]
"Weeee, Thousand-Year Candy!"

Miki pops into a smile.
Without a moment's delay Kiri confiscates the candy.

[Miki]
"Bwah, what are you doing!"

[Kiri]
"Sweets only is no good."

[Miki]
"But you ate them too dammiiit!"

[Kiri]
"Eat your meals properly. Health management is something we absolutely must do on our own from here on out, remember?"

[Miki]
"...ye-es."

[Kiri]
"What is it? You are staring at me with indecent eyes..."

[Taichi]
"Nah, I was just thinking what a nice duo you make."

[Miki]
"...we are the Flowers after all."

[Taichi]
"I wanna make you have your debut!"

[Miki]
"...but even if we have our debut now..."

Miki is weak-kneed.

[Kiri]
"We could sell no more than eight of those CDs."

[Miki]
"The million would be a dream within a dream."

[Kiri]
"Well then, I'll be buying two copies."

[Miki]
"Then I'll buy two too!"

[Kiri]
"Ten copies then."

[Miki]
"Yep, ten. Double digits."

Giggling laughter.
Intimate harmony.
And that was something that enriched me just a tiny little bit.
Shinkawa Yutaka was gazing lost at a grove of trees.
As I was drawing nearer to Shinkawa as he was, I called out to him.

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

Shinkawa was sweating.
On closer look, that's not the sweat of the heat of Summer.
He staggers back, unsteady.
A car came.

[Taichi]
"SHINKAWA!"

I caught him immediately.
//No contradiction with CCC3003, but this part is stronger here. He doesn't have the delusion of Yutaka being run over, as him remembering is now irrelevant, while this unconscious act (symbolizing regret for his past action, as hopefully obvious) is more important. -GHS
Soon afterwards, a lightweight truck passed by behind him slowly.
//The Tasaki store deco-truck, see CCC3003 -GHS
I go talk to Shinkawa, but he was still nonreactive.
And shaking.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa?"

[Shinkawa]
"Ah... my bad."

He returns to his senses.

[Shinkawa]
"It's jus'... when I look like deep in the trees... I get this really bad feelin' and stuff... it's been like that since a long time ago... why, I totally dun'no tho..."

He covers his face with his hand, as if puzzled by his own dizziness, for a time.
He then looked up at the blue sky, gasping as if pained.
The thing that Shinkawa had seen in the depth of the grove,
that was certainly---
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS
Wednesday.
To school.
A gate to prevent desertion.
It seems to exist less to protect students, and more to protect the outside world from us.
That is the impression it left.
I drop by the classroom to see. Just on a whim.
Just as I thought it would be, Touko's figure is nowhere.
//Either sent back or at home, dying. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

The heart thirsts.
I pin down the inner corner of my eyes. There was buzzing in the ears.
//Possibly she's even trying to talk to him, to no response. But he's too far away for her to reach now. See end of CCD2002 for reason for hyperliteral here, it's Touko-related. -GHS
There was no expectation she would come.
When this heart of mine will come to burst I don't know.
If I fail now, this will end up demanding another journey of long odds.
//He might mean relearning from the hokora, not just redoing things from the beginning of the route. -GHS
But even if I am brought back here for many hundreds, for many thousands of weeks, will I end up doing this all over again?
That I would not have self-awareness of this... it's intolerable.
//Losing awareness because of loss of memories, but possibly because of becoming too automatic (see Nanaka). Same fear as Miki, in a sense. -GHS
I left the classroom.
I chase all that is Touko out of my awareness.
//"I push poor Touko away as she tries to cling to me". -GHS
The beginning of the third day of The Always.
And yet, what is that but being fulfilled by the hollow.
The pool.

[Taichi]
"..."

Good.
//copypasta is tasty indeed! Mmmh, spicy mettabolla, the kind of typical Italian food you only find in the US of A! -GHS
It had been selected, just as predicted.
If there is nothing abnormal in either Kiri or Miki, the actions of the duo is deterministic to a certain extent,
provided that someone living in Eigentime, like Miki was, does not exist.
//Curiously, it's chosen in both the Kiri and Miki routes... where Miki obviously lives in eigentime. -GHS

[Miki]
"E'hy!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I said don't, dooon't!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahah! Kiri's all weeet!"

[Kiri]
"But we're into water aren't w-, AH! You'll wet my hair, you'll get them wet!"

[Miki]
"But aren't we in the poool!"
//The changes in the scene above are highly suspicious, but this is as close to proof that Miki was not looping in the Kiri route. And yet she took a reset. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Yeaaah buuut!"

[Miki]
"E'hyyy!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, my haaair!"
[Kiri]
"Vengeance!"

[Miki]
"Kyaaah!"

I was looking at a happy scene.

[Kiri]
"'llyyy!"

[Miki]
"WAAAAH!"

[Kiri]
"Drink thiiis!!!"

[Miki]
"I donn'wanna driiink!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, kickboard usage is forbidden!"

[Miki]
"It's my shield!"

[Kiri]
"Cheeeat!"

[Miki]
"The length of my hear is different, so I gotta have a handicap!"

[Kiri]
"But now that one of your hands got busy, your offensive abilities have decreased!"

[Miki]
"wAh?!"

[Kiri]
"Time to hunt!"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, kyaaah?!"

Splashing and splashing around they toss water onto each other.
It's so innocent.
Badump.

[Taichi]
"...!"

My physical heart took a leap.
My chest was struck, lightly.
Unconsciously I was pressing onto my heart.
But the heart, as in the spirit, is not inside my internal organs.
What I had felt gave a knock onto my physical heart.
I was happy it did.
From the bottom of the heart I thought the words, "this is pleasant" .

[Kiri]
"KyAaAh!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah, you feeell!"

[Kiri]
"I'm soaked..."

[Miki]
"We're in the pool so you'll get soaked!"

[Kiri]
"...now you said iiit."

[Miki]
"...eh, eeeh?"

[Kiri]
"I'm all wet so I might as well swim."

[Miki]
"Ah, ah-ah, close quarters combat nooo!"

[Kiri]
"You think you can beat crawl with breast stroke?!"

[Miki]
"Hurry-ingly-pani-icky!"

[Kiri]
"I'll plunge you down!"

[Miki]
"Nooo! If you wet my hear it'll turn into Wakame seaweed!"

[Kiri]
"I'll make you into Wakame-chan theeen!"

[Miki]
"Wah, wah, bad!"

[Kiri]
"Soh'raaa!"

[Miki]
"Myeeeeeeeeow!!!"

Sounds of water bursts.
Ceaseless laughter.
A gentleness that reminds of the soft flowing of hours.
A scene from a warm world.
I engraved this on my heart,
so that I would never forget.
So that I could remember in detail.
And I, all throughout, gazed at these two girls lost in their playfulness.
My first meeting with Kiri was simultaneous with my reunion with Shinkawa.
//Possibly even on the same day. Just the kickdown with Miyuki, he meets Kiri again the first Miki encounter, then there's the formal introduction. -GHS
I did hear from Shinkawa that he had a niece, but I would've never thought it was Kiri.
An awkward embarrassed greeting.
A condemnation from Kiri, who was still unused to the Gunjou Institute.
An unpleasant mood.
My speech to Kiri about people like me who are incapable of adapting,
//Those who can't adapt sink into their own worlds... -GHS
a declaration of the contradiction in Kiri's words,
and then my prediction of Kiri's future, based on her being a girl who wants to maintain that sense of justice.
And then I asked one single question.

[Taichi]
"Making friends is a hassle. But going without making some is unacceptable. Do you know why?"
[Taichi]
"Because they're necessary. Necessary for the rearing of a heart."

That's not something applicable to everyone,
yet for me, that was truth above all others.
Having subsequently been acquainted with Miki, it became that her and Kiri came to the Broadcast Club together.
And further my awareness flies, remembering those days in detail.
//Hum, a difference here, but it's not really worth belaboring on. Assuming Older Revision(tm). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, you caaame!"

[Miki]
"Oi there!"

[Kiri]
"...hi."

The two were like a pair of flowers as grown in a flowerbed.
The welcoming reception for these two is one of my happiest of memories.
//Think about that for a second. Ouch. -GHS
Being silly and foolish, and noisy, uproariously noisy.

[Misato]
"...seriously, you people."

That was how they were introduced.

[Miki]
"I learned a lot."

[Kiri]
"..."

Those were the faces they were making.

[Taichi]
"Private 『Mountain Witch * Yamanba』 Miki!"

[Miki]
"Oss, this is Yaman-O-be. Yes!"

One of the [ITEM]s is an elegant colored card.

[Taichi]
"For you, from that superstar turned plastic surgery expert, that Mild Robot who just a bit loves 'em mischievous little boys, Mic**el Jack**n's---
//Missing censorship. Still assuming older revision, -GHS

[Miki]
"A-, autograph card?!"

[Taichi]
"...most fervent admirer and heartfelt inspiree, the autograph of the 『Aristocrat of Love * Kurosu Taichi』."

I impose it on her.

[Miki]
"(Ayaya)"

[Taichi]
"(Oyoyo)"
[Taichi]
"Next, Private Sakura Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"To you, from the Big Man who is right now baseball himself, Ba*e Luth's---

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"You are presented with a Taichi Doll."

[Misato]
"Those two sentences are not connected are they."
[Misato]
"Really, they are not, not at all."
//More skip -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"'ullo, Kiri came din't she?"

Yutaka had come. With a smile.

[Touko]
"Seriously, Taichi! Did I not tell you to wait did I not! Whyyy did you go on alone now!"

Touko---
Argumentatively argumentative.
//Lit. "rub, rub" (?) -GHS
Simultaneous visitors.

[Touko]
"MokYYYYYYYYYY!!!"

[Kiri]
"We're fine so hurry and leave! This is embarrassing!"

[Shinkawa]
"But I gotta be worried that this ain't going well ain't I? ...yer so unreliable..."

[Kiri]
"This is going well. So go away, we're fine."

[Sakuraba]
"Hu, bustling day today."

Sakuraba muttered with a sigh.
And then, a smile that would burst---
Quite a bit like a festival's revelry:
that is the shape that the phenomenon known as Memories ought to have.
//This might slightly clarify what Youko means. Living in the past, or on a hallucination of it. -GHS
Scenes recorded in the memories can be recalled at any time, in accurate detail.
They are etched and carved on my accurate, movie-like memory.
//See CCC0002 (as updated) -GHS
It's only at times like this that I'm grateful for my distinctive peculiarities
High-quality memories that were fun in every way.
Never want to forget.
No...
Is forgetting even possible?
That night.
Sounds from the outside.
I put out the candle,
and go to the window,
to look outside.
Kiri is walking in front of the house, in the street.
I will follow.
............
A crossbow---
It was absolutely not a toy.
Coming into possession of that in this country means to have a weapon of power without compare.
It is not capable of rapid fire, but,
it has its edge in quietness, and is rich in destructive power.
Kiri pulls the trigger.
A bolt pierced a withered old tree.
The sound of slashed air remains in the ears.
Kiri nocks a new bolt.
She completes the load via the crank cocking aid.
She sets aim.

[Kiri]
"............"

Line of fire declines.
//This little and she loses the nerve to fire. Then again, without eigenMiki this is gonna be hard. Also note that as the Miki route shows, she had waaaay more practice than a few days. -GHS
Guilty mind, maybe, coincidence, maybe.
Fire.

[Kiri]
"......"

Kiri dropped a sigh to her feet, and she noisily rumpled up her head in a shake,
//Seems she's just shaking her head in disappointment. -GHS
seemingly in irritation.
She runs up to the timber turned target,
recovers the bolts,
and leaves.
I go have a look near that timber.

[Taichi]
"..."

Have I done something unfair now?
Kiri thinks of me a monster,
a monster that devours people's hearts.
And, right now, aren't I exactly that?
//Thursday September 10, 1998 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Because, at our previous school we did not have friends. Neither I nor Ani."
[Kiri]
"Even the people who were friends betrayed us... we could no longer trust anyone..."
[Kiri]
"We did not hurt anyone, but still everybody hurt us."

[Taichi]
"But in this world, it's ordinary for wild beasts that defend themselves to be shot to death."

[Kiri]
"...are you not human?"

............

[Kiri]
"I...!"
[Kiri]
"The world is unbearably frightening, yes."

[Taichi]
"What part of it?"

[Kiri]
"...the malice."
[Kiri]
"Everybody's malicious..."

............

[Kiri]
"...I think that humans, when they depart, will just vanish like that... because in this world there is nearly nothing."
[Kiri]
"I am sure, there is Nothing in so much. In just so little is there Anything!"
[Kiri]
"And we won't know when we will be washed away... I think."

[Taichi]
"Sort of... an SF-like thing, the Fall of Mankind?"

[Kiri]
"It is different from that... it is different in how there is a reason in that..."
[Kiri]
"This will be like waking up from a dream."
[Kiri]
"If all is quarreling, then everything is scary..."
[Kiri]
"But one day, all of a sudden everything will be no more... and I keep thinking, what if I was the only one that will be left behind... in that tiny worthless world..."
[Kiri]
"I... I'd..."

............

[Taichi]
"The shape happiness takes is different among people, that's all."

[Kiri]
"...that is not right."
[Kiri]
"There might not be malice or anything, but, that is not right to me."
[Kiri]
"Because... when people exist... to still exist one by one as if solitary islands on distant seas... closed off..."
[Kiri]
"That is just not right..."

............
"Care about me, please---"
//switcharound again -GHS
It's just as if Kiri, all along,
had been shouting that.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

I was awake.
I had a dream,
a nostalgic dream.
That chat with Kiri about malice.
Which reminds me that I didn't know in what way, exactly, those two had been rejected from the world.
The rough outline is imaginable, however.
//Hint that you gotta think for yourself here...? More interesting, since Kiri's chat heavily inspired his Parallel World, the hint may be in that direction. After all, that's why Kiri believes there's no one, or at least, why it's so easy for someone who doesn't pry too hard to think she does. -GHS
In the end, people are living for their own sake.
In the midst of so many desires produced by a meeting of touches with other people.
So ironic.
The time was now just right.

[Taichi]
"About time I go then."

Kiri was there,
The world is what she is facing down.
//Going with confrontational-y due to duh Kiri. -GHS
It carries away even my volition, inducing a return to memories of the past.
//So very interesting: his memories fly back along with his will. He can't change the past; but his memories, those he can alter... -GHS
The end of Summer, when the voice of the cicadas still remained.
Kiri stood on the rooftop, alone.
At that point I was still someone in Kiri's sympathies and understanding.
//"I still understood Kiri" + "she still had sympathies for me" - as it's only after this scene and nothing else that Kiri begins to hate Taichi. After all, he screws up things here and bad. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu... senpai?"
[Kiri]
"Yutaka... Yutaka, he... fell from here..."

This event happened one week after his suicide.
//Always that one damn week. -GHS
Kiri was squaring off against her delayed sadness, and it was to her that I posed this question:

[Taichi]
"Say, Kiri, I'm wondering... was Yutaka happy?"

[Kiri]
"...always, he was always feeling bitter."

[Taichi]
"Truly, always, bitter?"
[Taichi]
"There were never times of happiness, not even one instant?"

[Kiri]
"Well..."

I was puzzled, too,
as to how to treat Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Crying is fine you know."
[Taichi]
"At least, before Summer ends."

[Kiri]
"...bwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"

Eyes downcast, grabbing the hem of my shirt, and screaming out.

[Kiri]
"Yuta-nii... he died... he's dead..."

A wail of tears.

[Taichi]
"......"

Kiri and Yutaka were as if real brother and sister,
as if halves of their bodies.
And Kiri had lost that support now.
And then, I... Yutaka I---
//Is it clear now that this should be kept ambiguous? -GHSoHelpful

[Taichi]
"Kiri... lonely?'

I was hugging Kiri so naturally.

[Taichi]
"Lonely, aren't you."

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu-senpai?"

Whether Yutaka was happy or not,
until he had reached that last instant,
there was certainly laughing.
//Ambiguous, see below -GHS
There certainly should have been laughing.

[Taichi]
"I think Yutaka was happy, you know. Because you were there too, Kiri, so he could forget about the bad things."
[Taichi]
"He was happy until his last, that's what I believe."

There was certainly laughing.
//(Well, OK, technically PCP) -GHS
I bring her face close.

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

I stole a kiss by force.
Was Yutaka happy?
There was certainly laughing.
I was certainly laughing.
//Ergo ambiguous all the way above. -GHS
Kiri dyes with terror.

[Kiri]
"......?!?"

Kiri, stirring, I hug with strength as I pillage the space inside of her mouth.
//Same term as CCC0011C. This is attracting attention to this contradiction. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...fhWhah... no... can't!..."

That instant, Kiri had at last comprehended what was being done to her.
I am pushed away.

[Kiri]
"You are..."

I was certainly laughing.
//Now or before? With her with Yutaka? Joyfully or wreckfully, as Kiri laughs in the end of the Miki route? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!!!"

When I come to notice, Kiri was there no longer.
I ended up estranged from Kiri.
She nearly stopped showing face at club.
There were times when Miki would forcibly bring her along, but she avoided me.
Conversations vanished, connections terminated.
And that... was one of the things that did happen---

[Taichi]
"......"

Unexpectedly, Kiri's guess had ended up being correct.
//Chicken and egg. -GHS
Humans, indeed, perish so readily after all.
Well then.

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

I quietly called out to her.
Kiri was not surprised.
She turns around, taking her time.

[Kiri]
"...so the world came to be like this... where even people are gone..."
[Kiri]
"In exchange for malice being gone... its density is also gone..."
[Kiri]
"And yet there you are, unchanged."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Kiri]
"...I have meant to ask this for some time."
[Kiri]
"Senpai, how come you are alive?"

『Say, I got one question though... why don't you just die right this very instant?』
Overlap.
Past and present,
crossing.
Exactly as if the blade cast off long ago had now suddenly been thrown back at me.
What an ironical composition.

[Kiri]
"Do you think you have the qualifications to live inside of yourself?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Kiri]
"You are... wicked."

How the word uses that kanji from my last name. I found that to be an accurate metaphor.

[Kiri]
"You're no person. You have nothing more than the semblance of a person. You camouflage yourself as a person. As insects do."
[Kiri]
"Camouflaged, you take the shape of a person, and attack people."
[Kiri]
"You are something that hurts people. Completely incompatible."
[Kiri]
"The reason why your Conformity Coefficient crosses over 80 has been inexplicable to me for a long time. But that is absolutely nothing strange. Because the part inside you that is human is literally less than twenty percent and no more."

Talking with garrulity,
she goes to construct vivid images, overturning the pattern thus far preserved within the name Sakura Kiri.
The knife that were those words were trying to stab at my very essence.
The dull knife that was all she possessed so far---
Became Sakura Kiri's trump card!
//I suspect this stuff had to be pared down, but there was no time/interest even in the console revisions. -GHS

[Kiri]
"You are a monster."
[Kiri]
"Your deceit is that you do not pour your heart and soul into the monster you are, despite your place in society being that of a monster."
[Kiri]
"Did you think that empathy could sprout between person and monster, and that you could have a happy life in harmony with others? That you would be able to lay hands on the happiness of the ordinary person?"
[Kiri]
"It will not be."
[Kiri]
"In this world there is just a little kindness and no more, but there is absolutely no part set aside for you. No, it is simply out of the question that any ever would be set aside."
[Kiri]
"It is the same as no one would hug with love the parasite that comes out of their body, having devoured its way through it. Should one like that ever even exist, they would be madmen."
[Kiri]
"You are always searching for game to become a sacrifice for your own benefit. This is clear to me. Up until now, that was something you could suppress. But then the world became like this, the number of persons became insufficient, so your suppression is ineffective."
[Kiri]
"Because the need for camouflage has vanished."
[Kiri]
"Your eyes are always focused on us, so that you can enjoy the hurting. And it's not something done instantly, you slowly take the time to perform that bullish sexual 'teasing' of yours all the way to the end."
[Kiri]
"Not a person, nor a monster."
[Kiri]
"Then who or what are you? You are neither who nor what, that is what you are, just something that ought to have disappeared from the world. That is what I think."
[Kiri]
"The majority of mankind was so full of malice, but even that had a value far greater than your one life. To me, that is the truth."
[Kiri]
"I will give two pieces of advice."
[Kiri]
"The first, if you believe that within the exchange of touches with other people you will become a real human, you are mistaken. That will not be. Thinking that is to blaspheme humanity. Because I have never seen a more perfect monster than you, Senpai."
[Kiri]
"You are, without exaggeration, a psychotic, a deviant of the soul. A madman among madmen."
[Kiri]
"...the crowning jewel of all that go mad."
[Kiri]
"And then one more. Do not even think of wanting to lay your hands on us in any sense."
[Kiri]
"Should you approach us in search for a sacrificial lamb, Senpai..."

Kiri unleashes the very final thrust.

[Kiri]
"I will shoot to kill."

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"...I will never, ever hand Miki over to you."
[Kiri]
"I won't let you break her!"

With the sound of determined footstep, she passes right underarm.
The door creaks.
The door shuts.
I became alone.

[Taichi]
"...a monster, then."

I ruminate over the word, and try biting into it.
That was something I know, yes, but.
...it's harsh.
Just as the records of the past said, Kiri came by.
I follow.
This way, right.
Straight and forwards, into the grove of trees.
Just one little problem:
Youko-chan.
Is she someone I should expect to act according to this harmonie preetabilie?
//see CCB2010 -GHS
Suppose the girl did not act:
would the gap between Kiri and me ever be filled?
Because if it's not filled...
//See CCB2002: is the reason Taichi's going without food Youko cooperating to push the two together? 'Cause without potatoes, there's no progress in that route. -GHS
While still holding on to the doubt, I come to the place that is my objective.
I switched my eyes in preparation.
I can see the night so clearly.

[Kiri]
"...hyah!"

I could hear a shriek.

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan, stop!"

[Youko]
"..."

There was no semblance of surprise.
Perhaps, she just knew.
//She's unreset, of course. With no sign of her anywhere at the hokora, not that there'd be, but, of course, Taichi in Drag works ever better. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!"

Seeing a chance, Kiri moves.
Youko-chan casts a stone.
//A beautiful melting pot, really. -GHS

[Kiri]
"!!!"

Kiri, startled by the event, cannot deal with this.
It strikes her calf with strength.

[Kiri]
"Gh!"

Thump, and Kiri squats down.
Grasping her leg, grinding her teeth. She must be feeling intense pain.

[Youko]
"......"

She sets a second stone in the belt.
Utilizing the springiness in her wrist, she creates the afterimage of a disk. Instantly.

[Kiri]
"Wa... wait..."

Kiri's face turns pale.

[Kiri]
"Wh-, why... are you...?"

[Youko]
"Because you want to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"?!"

[Youko]
"Because you are practicing to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"...th-, that's why... you are going to kill me...?"

[Youko]
"..."

She's serious, is she?
Regardless, this is not the time to think.
I can do no more than act as planned.

[Kiri]
"Ahhh..."

The number of revolution grows.
The sharp sound of wind cutting the air.
As the destructive force swells out in front of her eyes, Kiri is bound down by fear.
The certainty of death.
That is something that Kiri cannot believe.
Kinetic energy is being stored right in front of her eyes.

[Kiri]
"S-, stooop..."

Setting her crossbow in front of her face, she sobbed.
These are Kiri's limits.

[Taichi]
"That's far enough."

I stand in front of Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"

The number of revolutions falls.

[Youko]
"If that is kept alive then Taichi will be harmed."

[Taichi]
"Nah, I don't think so, not really."
[Taichi]
"...ain't that right?"

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Lemme do what I wanna do."

[Youko]
"...can't."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan!"

I call her name with strength,
but it doesn't seem she's backing down.
Does she still intend to kill Kiri after all this?
I don't get it.

[Youko]
"Removing."

[Taichi]
"I'm fine without removing."

[Youko]
"Move."

[Taichi]
"Not moving."

Behind me, Kiri is holding her breath and watching attentively.
A physical discomfort towards the combination between the relief of her life being saved and the idea of my intercession.

[Youko]
"But..."

Visible perplexity.

[Taichi]
"I don't want you to be a murderer using me as the reason."
[Taichi]
"If you wanna kill, come up with a reason of your own."

She falters.
Perhaps it's acting, I don't know.

[Youko]
"......but, for the sake of Taichi... I..."

My sake.
Killing Kiri with my name on her lips.
And she'll do that without ever thinking if the result would hurt me.

[Taichi]
"...always, always like that. Always pushing onto others what are just your feelings."
[Taichi]
"Even when it's unwelcome---"

Youko-chan twisted her wrist.

[Taichi]
"..."

From the side, Kiri's head had poked out to peek into our conversation.
I cover that face with the palm of my hand.
I thought the stone would strike true, but it flies off and shatters the tree trunk behind us.

[Kiri]
"Kyah?!"

[Taichi]
"..."

...missed.
Indeed it's acting, then.
Is she cooperating?
But why?
//So she can remove everyone else, this is just Taichi being really damn daft. -GHS
Youko-chan turns pale.

[Youko]
"Ah... sorry... forgive me..."

She was confused for a moment,
but I continued as planned.

[Taichi]
"You betrayed me, didn't you."

[Youko]
"...eh... uhm... but it's..."

[Taichi]
"You took advantage of me being distracted by conversation, didn't you."
[Taichi]
"...again?"

Her shoulders shook with a start.

[Taichi]
"You're precious, you tell me. I love you, you tell me. You keep pushing your favoritism on me."
[Taichi]
"...and despite all that, in those very critical moments, you betray me."
[Taichi]
"Again?"

[Youko]
"Wrong, that was, I meant... to preserve Taichi's personal safety..."

Disoriented.
So like her, that even when it comes to acting performance... she's so good.
The two of us have played every role, indeed.
//See CCC4009. And keep screaming it... -GHS
Well then, let's do this right!
I smile on the inside.

[Taichi]
"That's enough TALK!"

She cowers in fright, like a little girl being shouted at.
............
Youko-chan had left.
She forcibly and thoroughly stole weapons and volition to resist both from Kiri.

[Taichi]
"............"

From behind, the source of tension continues to emit its aura.
And while aware that it was slowly being converted into anger,

[Taichi]
"...how's the injury?"

[Kiri]
"What reason."

Angry and confused at having been saved by me.
Emotions growing complicated, that she's holding back a desperate desire to scream.
And with that mumbling voice,

[Kiri]
"For what reason... did you save me..."

[Taichi]
"The reason you ask... don't got one."
[Taichi]
"I wanted to save you, that's it, is that a problem?"

[Kiri]
"Please do not jest..."

[Taichi]
"...but I'm not jesting."
[Taichi]
"Well, that's how it goes. You're not gonna accept this anyway."
[Taichi]
"It's what being rescued by someone you don't like is about."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"You wanted to kill me, seriously?"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Aw shucks, thank ye."

[Kiri]
"You are far too dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Dangerous?"

[Kiri]
"You mess around with people for your own enjoyment, that is why."
[Kiri]
"Even when things are like this, you did not change at ALL!"

All of a sudden, her voice raises.
Soon, her tone lowers.

[Kiri]
"...you would kill a man just for the fun of it."

Mood stagnates.
Hatred is being mixed in it,
the hatred that Kiri is spewing out.

[Taichi]
"I won't kill anymore."

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"I don't want to kill anymore."

[Kiri]
"What are you...?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri, even I pretty much understand what kind of person I am."
[Taichi]
"I don't want any more destruction."
[Taichi]
"I dislike even the memories of that."
[Taichi]
"That is why I'm struggling,"
[Taichi]
"struggling with myself."
//This would be easier if the self were to be made visible... -GHS

[Kiri]
"........."
[Kiri]
"Why..."
[Kiri]
"Why did you save me?"

The question came again.

[Kiri]
"You should have watched me die without helping."
[Kiri]
"I see you as an enemy... and I believe you know that, but..."
[Kiri]
"There is nothing you can possibly obtain by rescuing me."

[Taichi]
"But there is."
[Taichi]
"If you live on, Kiri, and that has an influence on my heart... that will be what I obtain."
[Taichi]
"We talked of this before, right?"
//See the 'friends' things above -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ah..."

[Taichi]
"Also, if you were to die, Kiri, Miki would be sad."
[Taichi]
"That's not what you'd want, right Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"...right."

Good.
Kiri's being honest, just a mere little.
No need to make fun of her unnecessarily.

[Taichi]
"And I'll be leaving this off 'round here. I don't expect you to be convinced easily after all, Kiri."
[Taichi]
"So anyway, she's got some reeeal might."

Her stone throwing had bored a hole in the tree,
and the thrown stone had buried itself completely inside.
//Given the difficulties she had hurting Kiri with a free shot, it's not hard to think that the shot simply has been from near point blank, i.e. Taichi's position. Further hinting that there's no one here but Taichi. -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Well, back home, come now."

[Kiri]
"Kurosu-senpai, I... do not understand you anymore."

[Taichi]
"Do you now."

She's merely being tricked, nothing more.
//No, that smile at the end of the route is genuine. She was being deceived BEFORE. -GHS
For the sake of herself.
//...could be for HIS sake, too... -GHS
Kiri expects - hopes - that people would be in their 'correct' state, anywhere, anytime.

[Taichi]
"And, what Youko-chan said, I think she's serious."

[Kiri]
"?"

Kiri's eyebrows knitted as she wiped the corners of her mouth.

[Taichi]
"You're weaponless now. And staying weaponless would be best."
[Taichi]
"If you violate that agreement, I think she might seriously assault you."

[Kiri]
"......"

Her shoulders tremble, slightly.
In terror.

[Taichi]
"Me, I don't really think want to do much to anyone."
[Taichi]
"The absolute best would be if your antagonism towards me stopped."
//Not 敵意, animosity -GHS

[Kiri]
"...antagonism... stopped?"

[Taichi]
"It means we should sort of be together, that's it."

[Kiri]
"But that's..."

[Taichi]
"No good? But there's no other choice. I'll let you follow me around as you please."

[Kiri]
"There is one question I would like to ask, may I?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"About Yutaka."

[Taichi]
"...ahhh, that thing, right."
[Taichi]
"Could we not do this now?"

[Kiri]
"...why is that? Is it bad if we do this now?"

[Taichi]
"I believe it would be best if we do this after your heart has calmed down, Kiri."
//More than his, definitely. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Calmed down, I..."

[Taichi]
"...haven't that I can see."

She falls silent.

[Kiri]
"Uhm... that guerrilla training camp last week... what was that...?

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... wasn't it pointless, that."
[Taichi]
"Forcing the setting against will, gathering seven people with so much hardship, with soothing and coaxing, with blatant lies..."
[Taichi]
"Not even the time to blink the eyes and out came the faults in that attempt."

Still I smile.
Kiri threw a look at me that said she was yet discerning something heterogeneous.

[Taichi]
"We took down the tents in the worst of moods, didn't we."

[Kiri]
"...was not that something that you arranged?"
//There's exactly one 'n' of a difference. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed, I arranged that."

[Kiri]
"In order to widen everyone's wounds?"

[Taichi]
"You're mistaken."
[Taichi]
"...I just wanted to take back our silly innocent ordinary life."

[Kiri]
"...that is something I cannot believe."

[Taichi]
"Of course."

[Kiri]
"But I will let my doubts drop on the matter."

[Taichi]
"Yup... thank ye."
[Taichi]
"Well then, let's see those injuries of yours."

[Kiri]
"Ah, I am alright... do not touch me!"

[Taichi]
"If I donn'touch I can't know, duh."

The calf...
It's become swollen.

[Taichi]
"...internal bleeding, isn't it. She got you in a nice precise spot."
[Taichi]
"It'll hurt to walk, but it isn't serious."
[Taichi]
"The other?"

[Kiri]
"Shoulder..."

[Taichi]
"Strip."

[Kiri]
"?!"
[Kiri]
"I-, I knew it, you animal..."

Covering her shoulders, she steps back.

[Taichi]
"Come now come now, that was a joke. Don't take it so seriously."

[Kiri]
"Isn't that... just what you say before doing sexual harassment to Miki and to others anyway?"

[Taichi]
"Miki, you say now? But when she seriously doesn't want something done to her she refuses straight and clear, you know?"
[Taichi]
"She goes all, you can't do THAAAT!, cackling mad while she wallops me hard, didn't you see?"

[Kiri]
"...Miki does that?"

[Taichi]
"And when she does, I don't push the matter, either."
[Taichi]
"I'm adapting the boundary lines as I perform all kinds of contacts. Isn't that what with socializing is? Am I wrong?"

[Kiri]
"...you summarize it as if it was so clean... but it's sexual harassment..."

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, you just take things just way, way too seriously."
[Taichi]
"I'll be touching your shoulder now."

[Kiri]
"Eh... kyah!"

There was pain even when I went over it lightly.

[Taichi]
"...I touched the bad spot have I."
[Taichi]
"How much pain?"

[Kiri]
"...I can just about... still move the arm..."

[Taichi]
"Please raise it above the head."

Obeyed.

[Taichi]
"So there's nothing wrong with the bone."

[Kiri]
"...you just put too much strength into it, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"I didn't put any of the sort."

[Kiri]
"...men are all so strong aren't they... Shima-senpai, for example, he's so slender yet he can lift one of those monitors on his own."

[Taichi]
"...that guy's ex-basketball club, that's why... he can't run, that's it, his physical strength remains."
[Taichi]
"Well, just put a compress on that."

[Kiri]
"...I know that."

[Taichi]
"Good, so, shall we go home?"

I start going.

[Taichi]
"Come now, let's go!"

Unwillingly and grudgingly she comes with.

[Kiri]
"OW-!"

[Taichi]
"I knew it, it hurts, right?"

[Kiri]
"...please go on ahead. I will go home on my own."

[Taichi]
"Come now, hop on."

On the back.

[Kiri]
"...I-, I'm fine!"

[Taichi]
"Hurry it up."

[Kiri]
"I said I am fine!"

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan might be around, you know?"

[Kiri]
"...but even then..."

[Taichi]
"O.K. Then it's Senpai's orders. Hurry it up and piggyback."

[Kiri]
"...Th-, that is unfair!"

[Taichi]
"Hur! Ry! Up!"

Reluctantly, unwillingly,
Kiri rode piggyback.

[Taichi]
"I'll carry you back home!"

[Kiri]
"...but that will be impossible, I think... I am heavy, right?"

[Taichi]
"Heavy, you? You kidding, right?"

She's bizarrely light.
//As if she didn't exist... -GHS
I get walking.
The sound of trampled grass is delightfully crunchy.

[Taichi]
"Nice night. Right?"

[Kiri]
"...well."
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Friday, then."

There remain three days to the swingback of the world.
Let's do what's expected of us today, as well.
//I saw a mysterious bank of fog at the school entrance. Bloody London weather! But my brolly and stiff upper lip shall be undefeated, old chap! -GHS
I saw Kiri at the school entrance.
Or more like, she was leaning onto the shoe rack.
So as to be easily seen by me.
I might just as well call out to her.

[Taichi]
"How are the injuries doing?"

[Kiri]
"...I am fine. It more or less hurts, however."

[Taichi]
"It would've been better if you rested at home."

[Kiri]
"No, these are not injuries that serious."
//Has he forgot that Youko's graffiting her house? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Where's Miki?"

[Kiri]
"...seems she is not coming today."
[Kiri]
"She seems to have grown nervous."

Since she's had her XP reset to 0, Miki had become brittle.
//Like Kiri. Except Kiri just doesn't shatter until he literally goes and butchers her. -GHS
Well, maybe she just returned to the original Miki.
//BTW: how does he know she reset, since they both did? If he just remembers her being dead, how does he know she was NOT reset when none of the diaries ever spoke of it before her route? -GHS
...people truly have disappeared, haven't they.

[Taichi]
"...I don't think that girl's doing well, not at all."

[Kiri]
"Indeed... she is pushing herself beyond reason, in many ways."

[Taichi]
"It's so hot."

I look up at the sun.
//Second time this was spelled right. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I wanna go to the beach."
[Taichi]
"We went last year. Remember that?"

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"That was so fun! Too bad about Miki, though."

[Kiri]
"...yes."

The beach then.
We didn't go there this year,
and going alone is sorta pointless.
Three days remain.
Can I manage to accomplish this without becoming controlled by dark impulses?
I wanted something wholesome,
however against my nature.
//Visuals. -GHS
