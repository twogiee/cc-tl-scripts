Wednesday.

Even Newton would end up laughing at how I am going to school in obedience to the Law of Inertia.
//Less funny considering a love for inertia is likely the cause for all of this. Moreso considering the new CCD0009. -GHS
I walk the hills.
The inclines are severe, as always.
Pace grows slower.
At last I come out into a flat place.

"...!"

Broiled by a premonition, awareness heats up.
The body moves faster than rationality.
I turned around!

[Taichi]
"......not there?"

But I felt the presence of a person.
Yes... Nanaka's.
//See CCA0021, and contrast. Nanaka's the only character that's 100% not a 'person'. -GHS
Since I went to the hokora she has not shown herself, not once.
That girl knows what has happened in this world.
Then why am I not going searching for Nanaka?
I would say... because I would not find her.
//He knows she's not real. That's also why he never ever mentions her to anyone else, ever. -GHS
I won't find Nanaka. Never.
That was the feeling I had.
