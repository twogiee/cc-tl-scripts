[Taichi]
"Ahhh!!! So tireeed!!!"
//Wish I were rich enough to afford six exclamation marks :-( -GHS

[Touko]
"...thank you. For everything you've done for me."

Damn straight!
Anger remains, so I file a complaint to Touko.

[Taichi]
"Aren't you some leftover of a martial artist or something, you can do some physical labor too you know! I can see all through to the bottom of your feigned ignorance by the way! Ner-nernerner!"
//Most references to that sort of line tend to flow into this: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%B1%E5%A4%A7%E4%B8%80%E7%9B%B4%E7%B7%9A can't see from the description of the gag how that'd fit here, can't find any scans from the manga with examples, and no official English translation seems to exist. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fXIXAHr_mg this video may elucidate... maybe. Maybe. Nope. -GHS

[Touko]
"...what do you want a woman's thin arms to do! Aren't you stupid."

There was a little bit of offense in that.
Touko, written with the kanji for Winter and Child, is snow; therefore, when treated warmly she soon melts into a sticky syrupy mess. That is why she decided to absolutely never show her sweet side.

[Taichi]
"...I wanna take a cold bath."

[Touko]
"We can?!"

Bam, her face shined.
However and yet,

[Taichi]
"...but can we afford luxuries? Water is a valuable thing now."

[Touko]
"Ehhh..."

[Taichi]
"That's what I'd like to say, but we should take a bath."

[Touko]
"Seriously?!"

If she's this much delighted then...

[Taichi]
"Don't tell me, you haven't taken a bath in all this?"

[Touko]
"...th-, that's not true, no!"

[Taichi]
"Really?"

I sidle up to her.

[Touko]
"Wha-, what now!"

She sidles well away from me.

[Taichi]
"As a Smell Fetishist, I wonder if I can confirm it?"

[Touko]
"Wha-, that's false, stop it, don't get closer!"

[Taichi]
"Mwah hah hah."

Surfacing the laugh of a brute of a man, I drive my prey into the corner of the room.

[Taichi]
"What marvelous Poison (Ch*****an Di*r) could you be brewing, I wonder?"
//http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/2161285.html Indeed, though I wonder if he's just mistaking it as the French word for "perfume". -GHS

[Touko]
"...hy!"

Her well-ordered features distort into paleness.
//Ugh, this sentence. -GHS

[Touko]
"Don't get closer... if-, if you get any closer..."

[Taichi]
"If I do, what then? What opposition could a helpless young fujoshi of a woman, alone, pose? As an opponent of the 『Living Karadeka * 'The Trout' Kurosu』, even!"
//Of course he means fujoshi in the nice way, heheheh. See CCA0022, still no idea what the hell Tanaka was even thinking. -GHS

So ask Touko with the tone of a gentlemen and a pervert.

[Touko]
"...if you come to smell my body, then,"

Clank!
The sound of the hilt of a sword being disconnected from the mouth of its scabbard.
//Moving the SFX here. It overlaps the speech. -GHS

[Touko]
"Slay."

[Taichi]
"Ghyaaa!!!"
[Taichi]
"Is-, is that the Demon Blade Harakiri?!"

I inspected all the luggage, when did she manage to sneak it in!!!
Don't tell me that it's from beyond a gap in space-time...!?!

[Touko]
"How rude!"
[Touko]
"...it's my 『Favored Sword * Ima Kotetsu』!"
//See CCA0030. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasone_Kotetsu Seems to be just named after him. Oddly, one of the name pronunciations for 今 ima "now" is Yakiniku - roast meat. It's either incredibly odd or someone is trolling EDICT. -GHS
[Touko]
"Muso Jikiden Eishin-ryu... no dan."
//Most popular Iaido style. Not the best romanization, but this googles faster. -GHS

[Taichi]
"None?!"

[Touko]
"Because I'm forbidden from taking any you know!!!"
//People in Gunjou wouldn't exactly be allowed weapons, especially someone like her with a history. -GHS
[Touko]
"But the sword is good and will cut you nicely!"

[Taichi]
"Isn't what you just did against the philosophy of unsheathe-cut-sheathe of the Iai!"

Iai is a peaceful way of self-criticism where no man is slain and is slain by no man...

[Touko]
"If a life of disgrace is what awaits, then this is better for all of us!"
//Doesn't seem to be a quote. See sendback route. Much nastier than it seems. -GHS

[Taichi]
"UEITSU! UEITSU!"

I temporarily morphed into an American to remonstrate.
//Happens. -GHS

[Taichi]
"OKIEH, I geddit, I'ma stop with the kidding. So please, drop the danger on your side too!"
//Capeesh? -GHS

[Touko]
"Ngggh..."

Touko's eyes sparkled and dazzled,
as if a lu**tic with a cutting implement.
//See CCA0007. -GHS

[Touko]
"...no smelling?"

[Taichi]
"No smelling, no smelling!"

Smelling means no living.
//This was quite difficult to understand in the original, as the literal is just "no life". Improved in the console versions. -GHS

[Touko]
"...but."

[Taichi]
"So, uhm, if you go to my neighbor two houses down, there's a bathtub filled with water... and you can take a nice cold bath with that."
//Ah, the mystery of the bathtub. Why does the neighbor have that filled? And how does Taichi know, since he never bathes? -GHS

[Touko]

Scornful eyes disappeared down the hallway.
Thirty minutes later.

[Touko]
"I'm baaaack-y!♪"

Peppy and perky she came back.
Washed off together with the rest her bloodlust, I'm flattened flat by this sticky housemate.
//she's more like tsundepetta, except when she's PTA. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...wELcoME baCK."
//Odd emphasis. -GHS

[Touko]
"But no, you stink of sweat Taichi!"

Should I kill her... this bitch.
//See CCA0003. In this case it should be obvious, but since it's been kept in the console versions... -GHS

[Touko]
"You should wipe off all that sweat at least, really, that's slovenly!"

[Taichi]
"...I am a fetishist therefore on a fetishette I shan't lay hand but sexual harassment will ensue so stop it!"

[Touko]
"Why all angry now?"

[Taichi]
"Because I was made angry, what do you think?!"
[Taichi]
"...bah, it's fine. I will take this bath."

[Touko]
"Have fun!♪"

On returning, my room was completely tidied up.

[Taichi]
"Huh...?"

[Touko]
"Welcome back, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Wh-, what's this?"

[Touko]
"Didn't it get all clean now?"
[Touko]
"Two are living together now. Things must be settled and ordered."
//multiple meanings, duh -GHS

[Taichi]
"This something so like what Mutsumi-obasan would do..."

I shivered and quaked all over.

[Touko]
"When things were this filthy? Of course I would!"
//Oh, and see CCA0008 -GHS

In the manners of a young noblewoman, she repeatedly sweeped her long bangs with a fwasaaah,
filled with an aura that seemed to say, 'wasn't this well done then!'
Well, who cares about that.

[Taichi]
"Certainly you got this very clean... huh?!"

I peeked under the bed.
Nothing!

[Taichi]
"My secret books!!!"

She must first have seen the ones above the desk.
These things called women will sometimes act like that.
But, there's none.

[Taichi]
"Hey, Kirihara, the nu-, nude design reference books that were here, what happened to them?"

I was just temporizing.

[Taichi]
"Ah, those books with all the photos?"
[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Touko]
"Burned them, yes."

[Taichi]
"Le bambole!!!"

I straightened like a beam and fell down.
And got up.

[Taichi]
"Burned them?! Not thrown away... burned?!"

[Touko]
"There's... there was this feeling, that the instant I saw them, I had to do it."

[Taichi]
"You burned school textbooks! You are the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty! The Third Reich!"

[Touko]
"But I thought that if you hide them under the bed, then you don't need them... and also... it seemed sort of like a vulgar book... with those... those women all naked..."

[Taichi]
"I'm telling you, they were study books!"

[Touko]
"Is-, is that true?"

[Taichi]
"Could you talk about the Venus de Milo without the pursuit of the human fundamental of beauty that is in the body?! Learn of the Bishoujo Figurine Otakus of ancient times, who fell in love with the girls they themselves sculpted, and be ashamed!"
[Taichi]
"And now you shall repent. In the world of 451 Fahrenheit, where books spontaneously combust! In other words you are to be condemned into the fires of hell! That is the reward for roasting books of learning! You damn enemy of mankind!"

I thrust the finger at Touko so many times while I spin it round and round.
/冬子「そんなポンポン言われても……それに私だって迷ったのよ」

[Touko]
"You say so snappy and outspoken... but I hesitated too!"
[Touko]
"But... I don't know why, but as soon as I saw them... I got really really angry..."
[Touko]
"I've heard around that in the outside world there are things known as 'pornographic books'."

[Taichi]
"*heartbeat skip*"

[Touko]
"I've always been to a girls' school so I don't know really, but they say... that... males would look at them... and then... fantasize."

[Taichi]
"*heartbeat skip* *heartbeat skip*"

[Touko]
"Erotic videos alone are one thing, but to seek that sort of embarrassing thing even in pictures..."
//Following lines are as normal -GHS
[Touko]
"But that'd be treachery, yes. When there's a person you like, having fantasies about other people is improper."
[Touko]
"Yes, improper."

[Taichi]
"Don't agree with yourself you..."
[Taichi]
"Tsk, well, no ways around this then."
//See CCX0001 -GHS

[Touko]
"Right, eh. What's past is past."

Should I rape her... this bitch.

[Taichi]
"Should I rape her... this bitch."

I had the frankness and the integrity of a saint.
//The irony, of course, is that it's true. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Besides, why do you even know that sort of video exists?"

[Touko]
"Because back then you told me they were musicals and lent me some, didn't you!"
//This is epic-tier. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I tOWWWd you that then..."
//ugh, the pun -GHS

[Touko]
"I went and watched them together with my family!!!"

[Taichi]
"I totally forgot that, but that's an extremely ideal development. I'm glad I lent them to you!"
//Another thing he "forgot", the Memory Hunter. -GHS

[Touko]
"THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD THING TO YOUUU!!!"

[Taichi]
"But you told me you had a videotape player!"
[Taichi]
"I had digitalized everything, so I didn't need the tapes anymore. And then in comes Touko saying she has a tape player..."
//1997-98 is indeed around when DVD started to take off as a format and replacing tapes. Both Youko and the Club seem like a shoe-in for having or being capable of procuring the equipment. -GHS

[Touko]
"...because Father often watches movies."

And to her Father this went.

[Taichi]
"The point is that you don't exactly have the right to criticize me when we're moments after you burned up people's private property without authorization!"
//End new lines -GHS

[Touko]
"Say, isn't it about time to fill the tummy?"

[Taichi]
"You're listening to me, I see."
//TL Note: this means she's not listening to him. -GHS

[Touko]
"What do we have? Potatoes again?"

[Taichi]
"No, today it's gotta be..."

And while we're doing all this,

[Tomoki]
"HEEEY!"
//No error, he said he'll do it tomorrow. Maybe he reorganized, possibly as a reward for Taichi not going with his sister. -GHS

A voice from the lower floor.

[Touko]
"That voice... Shima?"

[Taichi]
"Explaining'd be a pain, just stay put please."

[Touko]
"Ah, can I look around the other rooms?"

[Taichi]
"Please, feel free."

To the first floor.
I accepted Tomoki's package.
//............................... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Foooood?!"

[Tomoki]
"Eat it as if it were precious!"

[Taichi]
"Yes! Most glad for your club activities. What a shame, though, that you're so enriched by the deceit of being used to the idea of giving things to people."
//This explains what Club is to Tomoki. -GHS

Tomoki gives a tired laugh.

[Tomoki]
"...this's certainly just a distraction for me, innit."

I return to my room.
Touko was not here.

[Taichi]
"Hoooh hoh hoh."
[Taichi]
"Mwah hah hah..."

Spontaneous laughter escapes.

[Taichi]
"What a clean room. Right. Truly refreshing."
[Taichi]
"I obtained order in exchange for the books under the bed... but Touko-kun, you are much too naive!"

Those are my decoy porn books!!! (dun-dun-DUUUN)
My favorite among favorites are... of course secreted in a different location.
It appears that no hand has touched the cosplay collection that is in the closet.
//Shouldn't it be in Youko's room, next door? -GHS
Meaning Touko's PTA Power can still be called shoddy as well as lacking, still.
* PTA Power = Taichian for the skill of ceremonially
  perceiving unwholesomeness, found in guardians
  as well as teachers.
//Merged lines again. See CCA0007. Fits in with that Buddhist training ritual where you have to clear your mind or you get caned. It would certainly require PTA powers. -GHS
The underclothes for female uses are in the closet of my onee-chan's currently masterless room.
//That should be Youko's room, see CCC0003A. -GHS
When you want to hide a tree leaf, what better place.
//Adapted a bit. Correct proverb should be 木を隠すなら森の中 -GHS

[Taichi]
"And therefore, the books so favorite they may well be a part of my soul... heh!"
//That 'therefore' should let the two lines above connect a bit more to the rest. No hands on the cosplay + underwear in Youko's room untouched = she can't have found the safe. But how does he know about Youko's underwear if he's not in that room? -GHS

Not even a highly trained Super Ninja could ever notice!
Behold, disguised in the wall, the shocking presence of a hidden safe!!!
//Avoiding camouflage because of CCB0006 and CCC3009. -GHS
/人類建築工学の末に生み出された極限のプライベート空間を！！
The final product of human architectural engineering is an area at the utmost extremes of privacy!!!
Previously, I had been making money on foreign goods on Youko-chan's advice, and in those ascendant times I had this made.
//Part 5, Taichi the Failed Speculator. Specifically 'goods'. -GHS
Fire Proof Fire Resistant Hidden Safe 『Hidden Heaven』!
* Hidden Heaven = product name
//Not one that seems real, though. -GHS
I grasp the knob embedded in the wall, and give it a sharp twist.
It slides to the right.
And there, the front of the safe.
There are no records of the required PIN.
It is nowhere but inside my head.
In other words, even if that famed Lupin were to come and search the place, there would be no chance for him.
//See CCA0021. Oddly, CCC4010 hints it's Lupin the 3rd, when given the style I'd have also guessed the original. Hmmm, Touko-Fuyuko-Fujiko? -GHS
9991.
//ククク一？ it's 2-7 + 1 -GHS
Clank, resounds the lock as it is released.
This number is derived by my name, Taichi.
The 'Ta' can be read as 'many', and the farthest ends of that would of course be 999. Plus the 'ichi' in Ta-ichi, that is 1.
So much wit is mixed there, that it should be much more difficult to derive than from a birthday.
I insert a finger in the depression, and opened the square door.
...it was empty.

[Taichi]
"MY SOUUUUUUULLL!?!?!?"

"ahGchGchGchGchGchGchhh!!"

Something leaves from the mouth.
* Something = the ghost
//This is the usual anime scene when people too shocked have their soul leave from the mouth. It sometimes can be crammed back in, as happens here. Strangely, I can't source a reason for either event to be possible except for the word "Japan". -GHS

[Touko]
"Kyah! What is wrong, there's something white coming out of your mouth?!"

[Taichi]
"...hGah?"

I return to my senses.

[Taichi]
"GWOOOOOH!!!"

Making my hands as if a net, I haul in the escaping 'thing'.

[Touko]
"...you're sucking it back in..."
//ew ew ew ew ew damn fujoshi -GHS

[Taichi]
"Re * suscitation!"

I settled in a Heroic Pose.

[Taichi]
"You! Kirihara! What is this! Where are the contents of this secreted location? No, in the first place, reveal how you discovered it!"

[Touko]
"How... I felt this ominous aura... I searched around and found this safe... then I figured out the combination from the name Taichi and opened it..."

Girl PTAgenius?!

[Taichi]
"The contents?"

[Touko]
"Told you,"
[Touko]
"I burned them."
//Now see CCD5001. Whoops, not funny anymore. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Allll?!"

[Touko]
"Yep."

[Taichi]
"Allll?!"

I asked it twice.

[Touko]
"Ye, yep."

[Taichi]
"Clu-, clu-, clu-,"

[Touko]
"Chicken?"

[Taichi]
"Clueless you weren't that into this small mysterious area there was one part of my own seeelf!!!"
//A bit crowbarred, I admit. -GHS

[Touko]
"But... there were girls... tied up... or wearing school swimsuits..."
//Ahhh, he's into bondage. -GHS
[Touko]
"They seemed particularly weird, so I burned them with special attention, yes."
[Touko]
"Don't fret. Because you won't need those things anymore."

Chuckling,

"...I'm fine with becoming your design model myself, yes."

[Taichi]
"AhWahWahWahWahWahWah!"

When I had at last finished my rap-style despair, I screamed the title of the final unfinished work of Dazai Osamu, and swooned.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Dazai -GHS
And at the bottom of my awareness,
I remembered of last year, about this time.
