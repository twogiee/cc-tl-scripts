Pyyyy. (-ing)
//Of course, Gunjou likely has independent plumbing, and it could still be turned on (water tower, again), but then why the two oddities above? Considering the fake Alt World stuff, it might be that it does, but we're seeing it weirdly because Taichi is projecting it here even when it obviously doesn't belong. Also see CCD0014C, where the joke is certain. And I wrote nearly a kb on whether a SFX refers to pee, yay analysis! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whew."
//I guess he's in front of the mirror because he moved here to wash his hands. -GHS

[Touko]
"...without any consultation."

[Taichi]
"!!!!?!?!"

I was deathly jittery.
//See CCA0006, CCA0010. Isn't this interesting. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Yo-, Youko-chan."

[Youko]
"Playing pretend-a-lovers?"

She says in a flat monotone.

[Taichi]
"You know, could you please stop doing the shinobi act all the way up to people's backs without even a hint of presence?"

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"What would you do if you stopped my heart!"
//See CCA0022 -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi's heart... stopping so easily... can't be."
//Youko will be using Taichi's name in third person. Whether the two are the same, she thinks him a part of her; therefore, she'd be talking with the moe affectation of speaking about herself in third person. There's also reasons of creepiness (she rarely ever addresses him as if he was even there at all) and distance (Youko is one of the few characters Taichi calls with honorifics, and it's not the respect he has for Misato nor the fun/malice he has for Miki and Kiri) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, that's rude!"

[Youko]
"Cohabitation in secret from me."
//same gender???? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whyyy do I even need your permission now, Youko-chan!"

The eyes inside of the mirror dampen subtly.
Truly and well subtly.

[Taichi]
"And didn't you just say it yourself. It's pretend-a-lovers."
[Taichi]
"If you can understand that much, there shouldn't be any particular problem. There's no reason to be all upset about every single little pretend-playing, right?"
//See CCA0017A -GHS

An indistinct hesitation in her.

[Taichi]
"...but, you have done this before, Taichi... it was a mistake."
//Taichi and Touko, Taichi and other people, other Taichis... but of course he only thinks the first. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The situation back then was different."
[Taichi]
"And because of that, I have a good amount of responsibility to Touko."
[Taichi]
"...and there's the possibility, that once things settle down with the life we have now, that she could even gain some measure of independence. Then I'll be fine with going back to the starting mark once again."
//Meaning 'formatting', see CCD2002. It's a load, though. -GHS

[Youko]
"...low probabilities of that."
//With the reminder that, if there's a loop, then the probability of something happening should be defined at the start. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's why I said that there was just the possibility, really."

[Youko]
"......"

Maybe she assents, maybe not.
Divining an answer from those flawlessly regulated features is impossible.
Fundamentally, she has a thorough poker face.
//Specific term. Also, lady gaga reference here because those are what smlrt adults make references to, as well as pokeman and nyntendo references. -GHS
Fundamentally.

[Youko]
"If carnal desires were to become uncontainable..."

[Taichi]
"That thing again."

I interrupt her, with strength.

[Taichi]
"Just drop it. Right now I am going out with Touko, that's it."

[Youko]
"...indeed."

She leaves, abruptly.
The instant she vanishes from the field of view, so her characteristic felt presence vanishes.
All indications of presence suppressed, all by her own.
That is just something she is capable of doing.
//Like she just never was there in the first place. Sooo... what if she wasn't? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Siiiigh..."

So tired.
