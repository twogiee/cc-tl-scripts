[Nanaka]
"Yahooo, Taicchan!"
//thisi s aparentlly NOt a refernce to yahoo -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh my?"

The cycling woman of mystery.

[Taichi]
"The cycling woman of mystery."

Dammit, thoughts passed through the mouth!
//Or, "thoughts passed through my mom's mouth". May be stretching it... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I wish you wouldn't pass thoughts through the mouth."
//...then again, this seems clear enough, really. -GHS

Discovered.

[Taichi]
"Suspicious, ain't she, this female. Origins and background unknown. Uniform that I have never seen."

[Nanaka]
"...I wish you wouldn't turn defiant and use thoughts as pretext for words."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka she says her name is, but is that the truth?"

[Nanaka]
"...shaddap you. Don't just keep fussing tediously on the details."

[Taichi]
"What school do you go to?"

[Nanaka]
"Shi-kuh-ret."

[Taichi]
"Ah, right."

I ignore her and quickly walk on.

[Nanaka]
"Oh, hard-boild'y〜!"
//See CCA0022. -GHS

[Taichi]
"We can talk even while walking you know."

[Nanaka]
"Yah whatev'."
//Unlistenable moe words. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, got business?"

[Nanaka]
"'Course I'm here on business!"

She points close at me.

[Nanaka]
"Put that antenna together right quick!"
//Usually she tells him to go to the hokora, but I guess the more he puts the antenna together... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh?"
[Taichi]
"The antenna, that thing Misato-senpai's doing you mean?"

[Nanaka]
"Yep, that."
//First and pretty much last time she'll acknowledge the existence of any specific person outside Youko. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"At this rate you might not make it in time!"

[Taichi]
"To what?"

[Nanaka]
"Time limit."
//See CCA0030: before the heart explodes, of course. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Of what?"

[Nanaka]
"Ohhh really, youuu!"

[Taichi]
"Wh-, what's with that!"

She flew off the handle all of a sudden.
//hurr hurr -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Once, just once, live like your life's precious! But you get caught in the moment and always but always waste it all, and before you know it your very existence is stuck into fixed behaviors!"
//This is sooort of important. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Because possibilities have that as their nature! It's like when you go to reset Wi***ws because of problems in the temporary cache and then you find that it has the same error over again! Especially now it's---"
//Nanaka's being quite inaccurate here. "一時キャッシュ" is the temporary cache... of an Internet browser. If that cache gets corrupted, then you gotta clear it, not reset the PC; then again, that's the whole point, isn't it? It works exactly like this in the time loop: he clears the RAM over and over, but the content of the hokora ain't gonna change. -GHS

Startled, she shuts her mouth.
//Can't well spoil the time loop, at the absolute very least. Especially since Nanaka seems to know very well (given there's no doubt it's just a part of himself) that none of it is quite what it seems. But knowing doesn't mean he has to realize. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...neurotic are ya, little bastard?"
//See Misato. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ya don't call this kyute catch a 'bastard' you DON'T!"

Smaaack!

[Taichi]
"Uh'owfuu!"
//No special meaning that I can find, but it's actually written うぉふぅっ. No, really. -GHS

That was one in the face.
//Typical of doctors to do so. -GHS
While spinning at highway speeds I am sprung diagonally, and as my status became horizontal I smacked into the ground.
//Highway speeds seemed somehow weirdly appropriate. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...oh... ofh... obh..."

This girl is capable of generating Comic Force Fields.
//Oh, but there IS a manga of hers translated: http://mangafox.me/manga/kuusou_kagaku_edison/ though it doesn't seem quite on this subject. -GHS
* Comic Force Field = Science-Taichinism.
A hyperscientific theory on par with Scalar
Electromagnetics and Ether Cosmology, or
devices such as the Meteoric Ascent Engine. An
acceleration and simultaneous mitigation of all
physical phenomena.
//Vs. science-fiction. Scalar Electromagnetics and Ether Cosmology are some of the few openly bullshit scientific terms in Cross Channel. I guess that's one of the few warnings readers get that when it comes to Taichi and science he's not to be trusted. Meteoric Ascent Engine seems invented, however. I'm sort-of kind-of finding it related to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_airship and also sort-of seems behind some old sci-fi Japanese stories about flying castles and the like (The Tale of Ukishiro?). 昇騰 is a rare/uncommon (/obsolete?) word meaning 'something rising up very high', and 'very fast' comes up often. -GHS

[Result]
the generation of a comic book-like

effect unimaginable by the normal laws of
physics. Statistically often associated with
unyielding childhood friend-like personalities,
it exists for the purpose of preserving the
nature of the character.
//IOW, it's what allows girls in comedy anime/manga to smack about the protagonist without actually hurting him. In more local terms, where Youko is the purveyor of apparent science, Nanaka is the magician; where Youko is a psychological disease, she's a supernatural guardian; where everyone sees science, there's your religion. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ah! ...sorry..."

[Taichi]
"What power... enough to take over the world..."

[Nanaka]
"Don't say sarcastic stuff like that to a girl!"

She graciously helped me to my feet.

[Taichi]
"Th-, that hueeerts..."
//Intentional -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...sorry."

[Taichi]
"When I said you could take over the world, I didn't mean mere brawn, I meant by characterization!"

[Nanaka]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Because of your scientific powers, even getting struck that hard means I can still live!"
//This makes more sense remembering that Zubaaan is him reliving the moment of his birth. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I don't really get it..."

[Taichi]
"But I should've been made to blow upwards a little more. Maybe up into the atmosphere while still spinning. Well, though I think only rushing to extremes in order to deviate from the ordinary is an indication of aridity, I do think of it as a form of variety."
[Taichi]
"The point is that acting in constant preservation of superficial positions is the easy way, and it's destined to degenerate into moments dominated by conspicuous exhibitionism."
//Hooo man this barely makes any sense. Best I can tell "don't just be bland, 'cause then you'll go blandly super-extraordinary with nothing 'real' in between", i.e. no superficial twists of the kind Cross Channel is unfortunately believed to be the king of. This is where the criticism of characterization and balancing meets the Inevitability of Downfall theme. ...and there goes another sentence I thought I'd never write in my life. See CCC0045A, "don't hope to revolutionize things with little tweaks", similar(?) but clearer(???). -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Do ya even wanna have a conversation with me?"
//As in, he's monologuing. That's more weird than funny, considering SHE is the one who used to monologue to him when he still couldn't speak. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...apologies."

I have no idea what that meant myself.

[Nanaka]
"There are no ways for you, really."
//See CCX0001 -GHS

Half-disgusted, she lets a sigh fall.

[Nanaka]
"Ah, blood's on your cheeky."

[Taichi]
"Eh? Could this mean that it was a bit out of the boundary of the force field?"
//What was the first rule of Fight Club again...? -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Still talking 'bout force fields and that stuff!"

[Taichi]
"I'm alright with my own blood."

[Nanaka]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"No, it's just that blood is my weakness, 's all."

I can't describe well those recurring expression that were on Nanaka's face at that moment.
There was something of the crying, there was something of the laughing.
That said, I can't take this as simply laughing while crying, as there's a deeply ingrained discord mixed in.

[Nanaka]
"...Taichi."

A voice that feels roughened flows from her lips.
Her face came closer,
together with her damp eyes.
This thing known as the conscious activity of the human being is really amazing.
//This is where Taichi folds back into his weird to avoid excess emotional attachment. -GHS
But if I were your ordinary manga protagonist,
(Eh...?)
I would be exclusively bewildered, unable to predict anything of what was about to happen at all.
Whereas this brain I have as a real human yet easily pulls off the prediction that we are in a 'chewation-like Event that has the name "I'LL BE KISSED?!" with all other conclusions impossible.
//"Sichu" is actually technical term, ergo 'chewation-like (and I still specified with Event). This is far funnier considering he's not so much wrong, but far too right. His too human brain has confused his mother for the osananajimi. -GHS
At the moment Nanaka's face is but five centimeters away, I am yet already in the process of elaborating post-kiss face-saving responses such as "what sort of behavior is that?!"
...but while this of mine is realistic, the reason that in the tales of the world it is almost never employed is that stories with an overly realistic nature do not inspire much affinity, and that is something vividly understood even by an amateur such as I.
//Paraphrasis: Reality is Unrealistic. The irony in this thing is subtle, considering this story is altogether too realistic in a sense. -GHS
In the end, it's just a game of pretend-reality.
//The achievement of the expression, which gives (or seems to give) “the inner consistency of reality,” is indeed another thing, or aspect, needing another name: Art, the operative link between Imagination and the final result, Sub-creation. -JRR Tolkien The *consistency* of reality, not reality itself. This is what makes characters realistic even in this excessively meta otaku-fied world, and I bet, the reason for the base success of Cross Channel even if utterly ununderstood. -GHS
And those are the innermost thoughts to which I am nodding a yes, yes of agreement.
And if I may ask, where's that kiss?
Schloop.
//nyorero~n. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

A bland kiss with no sex appeal.
But for the act of putting a tongue on a cheek and licking up to even take the name of K-I-S-S...

[Nanaka]
"I've put some saliva on it, and it'll get well now!"

[Taichi]
"BWAAAAAAH!!!"

Fist to the side of the head and strike, strike, strike!!!

[Taichi]
"Jumping to the wrong conclusions with those pretend-knowing thoughts! Damn you, damn you! You disgraceful...!"
//At least he knows his problem... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"But, yourself, to yourself?!"
//So she sounds adequately confused. Not that she doesn't know who he's talking to. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Reality, are you kidding me! Affinity, are you kidding me! The Greatness that is I thinks he's so smart, the worthless son of a bitch! Your social standing is that of someone who has been internationally proven to be subhuman!"
//ore-sama-yarou. He's so specific, and he forgets so easily... this is what Fixed Behaviors are. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ca-, calm down..."

[Taichi]
"I want to die."

[Nanaka]
"Come now, come now!"

[Taichi]
"This one has been making too many wrong mistakes and must therefore awaken to the reality of being garbage."
//It's more baseball stuff, as it recurs for reasons I guess to be simply that Tanaka likes baseball, and it's suddenly formal, so the intended effect would be humorous, i.e. Taichi's not quite accepting of this. Of course there's no official translation, so have a Yogi-ism instead. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Toxic garbage."
[Taichi]
"Because, there's many people who aren't really aware in Gunjou."
//The Experts, see CCC4009. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I'm always living with fear. I don't want to hurt."
//These and the following are entirely ambiguous. It's far from clear who'd be doing the hurting here, as it should be; Taichi's a good candidate for either, given his backstory. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Even if there's danger it can't be avoided, because there's no awareness."
[Taichi]
"It's like a cat running out in front a car."
[Taichi]
"...having no self-control is unacceptable. You have to be meticulously careful."
[Taichi]
"But,"
[Taichi]
"every day's so fun, so I just up and forget it all. About who or what I am I mean."
[Taichi]
"I am---"
//This is honest, but sorta dishonest in that he doesn't quite take this honesty seriously. -GHS

Nanaka stirred just slightly.
This time it really came out of left field, with no time for prediction either.

[Taichi]
"Eh...?"

[Nanaka]
"You said it's fun, and if you can say that, 's all good."

The ambiguous softness of a breast.
//This sentence is...... wait for it...... amb-GHS
The scent of a girl.
Inexplicably, I feel nothing out of order.
The feeling at the moment of embrace was so different from Youko-chan's.
//Another honorific fixed in the console version, as well as in CCC0045A. See CCC0000. This is not random in the slightest, the two characters are being directly compared. Whether they're both nonexistent, they're related in this sense. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Those words... they make me happy. Really."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Nanaka]
"Because never becoming strong is not a disqualification from living."
[Nanaka]
"Remaining weak is... still fine."

[Taichi]
"But remaining weak, really..."

Understanding.
//Vague due to this part being vague. -GHS
What does she understand?

[Taichi]
"You are---"

[Nanaka]
"Nanaka."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka..."

No understanding.
On absolutely no axis of the past is that name recorded.
//And that's how much his memories are worth. -GHS
Well then why does she... me...?

[Nanaka]
"You calmed down?"

[Taichi]
"...yeah."

We distance from each other.
Nanaka is smiling broad and bright.

[Taichi]
"...say, you."
[Taichi]
"Are you in love with me or something?"
//Double meaning easier to see in English if explicit. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ya dum'ass!"

*p't't'*
//petite. No, really. -GHS
Chopped right on the forehead.

[Nanaka]
"Told ya that ain't it!"

After the denial, she tilted her head in doubt and continued on the ear of the words she had left.
//"Resume the talk", but literally "inherited the ear of words", which although a set phrase in Japanese (話の穂を継ぐ), has a very similar expression in Chaucher: "an ere of [any goodly] words" http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/mect/mect63.htm so I adapted it to sorta like that, but withoute Ye Olde Englishe (fore enoewe). -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...but, riiight. I might just love you!"

[Taichi]
"Really?"

[Nanaka]
"But it's got a sorta different meaning from the kind of love yer thinking of."
//See CCC4022. So is Miki's as well...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dun' getcha..."
//Unspecific Eastern Japan accent. -GHSoHelpful

[Nanaka]
"Ya know you, I'm sure that you were the type to play perverted sexual pranks on your mother when you were a kid."

[Taichi]
"Thassnottrue!"
//Prolly same accent as above. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I was the same."
//As she played them on her kid. You know, I'm trying, but this still sounds sort of wrong. Not to go all Zigmund Vroid here, but Tanaka's love/hate parental relationship still remains very solid even here. -GHSolidBecausePenisFnarrFnarr
[Nanaka]
"But yannow, all that said, surely mother's gonna be happy too, right?"
//I'm not quite sure she's still talking in third person, and more sort-of reminding Taichi that she's more of a memory of his mother rather than her mother physically. After all, this script's been heavily meta VN focused, i.e. the idea she's merely a supernatural apparition in the To Heart/Key style is strong in this script. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Of perverted sexual pranks?"

[Nanaka]
"Yep."

[Taichi]
"But heavy petting from a young offspring's a bit shocking... nah, should I say maybe moe?"
//Hugged by a young boy + hugged by her own literal son + petting by penis. Yes, 'son' means dick. It'll return. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Go chemically decompose, you damn toxic garbage!"

[Taichi]
"Bwaaah!"

[Nanaka]
"So then, I should go home."

[Taichi]
"But you can come inside no problem. I can at least bring out the lukewarmish water!"
//Because he has no food, and nothing to heat the tea (troll). -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Nihihih, I don't wanna have perverted stuff done to me so going h-o-m-e."

[Taichi]
"I will, I will, come in and I will!"

[Nanaka]
"Too dangerous, too dangerous!"

She jauntily sits astride the bicycle.
And turning to my back and attempting to see her underwear go I.
Buruma Out of Control*.
* Dark blue
//http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1259121567 (J only), basically no control means dark blue, so going with cryptic and silly because that's actually literal. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tsk!"

...wait, they're buruma?!
That deep blue gym sexual harassment-ish uniform hunted down to extinction a fair while ago by the women's lib movement, that is, buruma?!
//According to Wikipedia it's a "mid-90s" thing indeed, so he's just after them. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Na-, Nanaka-san...?"

I shook and trembled with fear.
Rumors have it that what is clinging firmly to those hips is a superlative article.
//Hmmm, but he talks as if he didn't collect buruma... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"And that antenna, you go put it up pretty and fast!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, the antenna?"

All of a sudden.

[Nanaka]
"That is... possibilities, 's what."
//This just does nothing. -GHS

The chain spin, making a most delightful sound.
The tire graze the asphalt as the bicycle begins to ride forth.

[Taichi]
"...what was with that."
