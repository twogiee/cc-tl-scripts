JMP SKIP1
//Same as CCC3014. This time, I'm leaving the script commented out and inaccessible; note that there'll be sporadically minor changes in a few lines in some of these 'pasted scripts; I'm putting in translations for these new lines, but these will be entirely and often obviously older revisions that were never brought to date. Another reason to NOT do 'pasta this way! -GHS
/Am I being pushed back from the opposite side?
///This makes it sound like someone else is pushing him, instead of it being technically just the wind. -GHS
/And unchangingly, he wandered.
///Wandering doesn't mean he'd cut. This is less clear than the original line. -GHS
/Taichi: "Aaah, that's cutting. Prez is a cuuutteeer!"
///Newer script specified 'school', as technically she'd also have cut club. -GHS
:SKIP1
What development will there be with this touching of Senpai?
//As long as it's on the boobs, who cares? -GHS
I have familiarity:
my own experience, and also the records.
//Ahhh, begin Sendback ambiguity. His experience of what, exactly? Did he replay some of the routes? Or does he just remember? -GHS
It is necessary to proceed with caution.
Approach Senpai,
then touch Senpai, just a little.
And then---
Senpai was sleeping.
That's something I knew about.

[Misato]
"..."

A light sleeper's breathing, regular.
For a while I stared.
In the end her eyes opened, faintly.

[Misato]
"Ah... eeeh...?"

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"...Kurosu... kun?"

[Taichi]
"Peke I am."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun..."

Senpai repeats that nickname that is for her exclusive use.

[Misato]
"How long 've you been there... so embarrassing."

She covers her face.

[Taichi]
"I have arrived here just now."
[Taichi]
"More importantly, sleeping over here is very dangerous!"

[Misato]
"Ahhh, yes, I am alright, zzz..."

I lift her up,
//Hum, "I provoke her". -GHS

[Taichi]
"I said no sleeping!"
[Taichi]
"And do not let your glasses slip off either, please!"

I readjust her displaced glasses.

[Misato]
"hAfuh!"

[Taichi]
"And there, Senpai as always."

Only in the outwards.

[Taichi]
"Have you woken up?"

[Misato]
"Naaaah... sleeepy..."
[Misato]
"There is no problem, but, I can see your panties you know?"
[Misato]
"...! ...!!!"
//Nothing to do with CCA0004 technically. -GHS

She was awake.
She's a lady indeed.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"Go, good morning... ahhh, head huuurts..."

[Taichi]
"It is because you've been sleeping in direct sunlight. You will die you know!"

[Misato]
"No, I will live!"
//SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"An admirable determination."
[Taichi]
"It is just dangerous, this all, so I shall be of supervision from now on."

[Misato]
"...eeeh?"

[Taichi]
"In other words, it is about letting this Kurosu Taichi be a participant in your escape whoops I mean club activities."

[Misato]
"Cluuub haaas concludeeed!"

[Taichi]
Club has beguuun!"
//See CCC4001 -GHS

[Misato]
"But they just finished..."

[Taichi]
"Really, I just want to drop in once in a while, nothing serious."

[Misato]
"What does that..."

[Taichi]
"Well then, see you tomorrow."

[Misato]
"Yes, see you tomorrow."

I left the school building, and looked up at the rooftop.
There the antenna stood.
And next to it,
Senpai was, once more, still there,
working, blue collar,
even when it will soon be night,
alone.
I believed that never touching people was the sole and only way, at that time---
//Believing he can't cross predates his experiences with it. Since this is after Youko "rebuilt" him / spent years playing videogames and nothing more, this is something that's not entirely his. -GHS
At the time I met Senpai.

[Misato]
"Good day!"

[Taichi]
"...?"

[Misato]
"You are always alone, are you."
[Misato]
"I am called Miyasumi Misato."
[Misato]
"Will you not have club together with me?"

        Those are words I will never forget.
             The first Other Person.
                The first Someone.
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
I am awake.
Sunlight was piercing through the window.
Seems I have been hard asleep. I did not have any dreams.
The time is... 7AM.
Going to school is necessity.
//See same script. -GHS
In the past, I was walking this part together with that girl.

[Yusa]
"Oh my? Taichi-san?"
//Polite... with glasses... difficulties paying attention to the reality of things, but underneath it all, knowledgeable. She's totally a younger version of Misato. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'Morning."

[Yusa]
"Ah, good morning, yes!"

                    Yusa-chan---
           At that time we were friends.
Asleep.
I pick up her alarm clock,
it was set for noon.
She's done this up until the dead of night, has she.
Motion until sleepiness, perhaps.
That's just how much it hurts, perhaps.
I change the timer setting of the alarm clock.

[Misato]
"nAhnAh!"
//Literally n a n a, nana, 7. -GHS

She flew to her feet.

[Taichi]
"Already this sleepy in the morning, really, what is the big idea!"

[Misato]
"But I am not sleeping?"

[Taichi]
"You are sleeping."

[Misato]
"Ngggh."

[Taichi]
"And that is why I told you that you are sleeping!"

[Misato]
"Aaaah... ngggh..."

She rose herself with a wobble.

[Misato]
"First thing, good morning!"

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"If you sleep here in the middle of the day you will die of sunlight exposure, you know?"

[Misato]
"Ah, yes, that is right, I was careful."

Senpai lifts the hem of her skirt and wipes her glasses.
I look away.
Gentlemanly, gentlemanly.
//And there's Yusa again. -GHS

[Misato]
"Nyahmh..."

She kills a yawn in her teeth while wiping her glasses.

[Misato]
"Whew, body feels all sluggish."

[Taichi]
"It should, yes."

[Misato]
"What time is it by the way?"

[Taichi]
"It is around eight o'clock."
//So he takes around an hour to get to school from wake up. And, of course, 7 to 8. -GHS

She laid down in silence,
making pillow by joining hands.

[Taichi]
"But you'll die!"

Inside the bag laying down on the ground there were also alcohol bottles.
Drink and run and drink and run.
//Swim swim hungry? -GHS
You're so much trouble, Senpai.

[Taichi]
"Well, should I just help you of my volition, then?"

[Senpai]
"Kusuh, kusuh..."
//But it doesn't make sense here... oh wait this never made sense. -GHS

I take Senpai on my shoulders.
Damn there's not one hint that she'll be waking up.
The infirmary is deserted.
I lay Senpai to sleep in a free bed.

[Taichi]
"Good night, Senpai, and sweet dreams."

I continue the work.
Through the experiences of a long Eigenlife, I was endowed with skill and knowledge.
//Number of individual repeats post-Youko remains unknown. That, or it's a simple troll, and he's "suddenly" forgotten that he's supposed to have lost his memories. -GHS
I can systematize this process far more efficiently than Senpai.
I don't hate sweating in my work. It's pleasant.
As my body automates, one of my recollections rises to the surface.
//As he automates, he starts remembering. This is the other source of flashbacks as well as dreams. See CCC3004, CCC3009: he automates instead of just falling asleep like Yutaka more often does, but he can do the same. -GHS
The stage and setting being the rooftop, the heart patterns it to the distant past, trying to recreate the impetus one more time.
//And an admission that his heart (definitely in the sense of "mind" here, but aesthetics demand heart there) tries to reconstruct older memories by overlapping past and present. -GHS
The escape from the guard's eyes was my daily routine.
//And it could still be... -GHS
That day, as well, I had laid myself on the rooftop at lunch.
I was realistic about being discovered quickly, but unexpectedly, I found a blind corner.
//This doesn't seem to be somewhere on the rooftop, but the rooftop itself. Moreso when it's supposed to be off-limits. -GHS
Alone until the end of lunch break, staring vaguely lost at the sky.
A repose with no potential of hurting anyone.
//More insistence that he was certain he would hurt people before all this crap. It's pure 100% self-conviction. -GHS
And on the other hand, it meant an impossibility of creating connections with anyone.
No problem, I thought,
because the primary goal was life among 'people', and enjoyment was not taken into consideration.
//Obvious comment by this point. This was all Youko again... though any bad childhood would do this, really. -GHS
I was aware that I was holding a bomb within.
Being around people is, to me, a very bad purchase.
The required payment is an environment of sustained stress.
What is attained is unity in mechanics alone. Happy ending, none.
//ヌケる means to nuke right -GHS
That it would've become annoying was natural.
If I do it this once, there'd be no way out for me and no mistake.
//Given the possibility he's just chuunin' in delusion, this could mean "if I talk to anyone else I'll just hurt" or "if I interact I'll just murder everyone". -GHS
The solitude is made ordinary.
//See CCD0009 -GHS
With the exception of hardening one's heart, what means are there?
//This is contrasted with the ending. And with http://www.openbible.info/topics/hardened_hearts - also that's "donkan". Yes. -GHS

[Misato]
"Oh, we meet again, Kurosu-kun."

Having been approached and talked to, I turned to face.

[Taichi]
"..."

I was bewildered, I think.
Never had I experienced being contacted in this manner.
It was a female with gigantic tits.
//Early Taichi was sooo very rape nukige. -GHS
& glasses.
I'm not exactly devoid of even the smallest amount of carnal desires.
Fundamentally, I am not very capable around real females, however, I don't dislike them.
//The suuuuuubtle implication that he's into 2D (AKA avid eroge player) is quite awesome, in retrospect. He sounds so emo. And since he has technically a waifu - Youko - this sounds even odder. -GHS
The female smiles brightly, waiting for a reaction.
She seems to have no intent to get up and leave.
I released my Leave Me Alone aura.
//Oh, that superpower's pretty common. -GHS

[Misato]
"?"

The female did not notice it.
//Nothing of the sort, of course, though CCE0001 implies that she didn't realize that consciously. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...why do you know my name?"
//See CCA0003. Interesting. -GHS

With no other choice, I responded. Defeat.

[Misato]
"Ahhh, so that is the voice you have then."

She clapped her hands and smiled more and more.

[Taichi]
"Why. Do you know. My name."

Punctuating I question.

[Misato]
"Obviously. From the register of names."

The register she says.
That's not something you can just simply look at, can you?
Or should I say, is this damn school OK with just showing it?
//Of course. She might go insane if she doesn't get her way, after all. And who cares about the privacy of whackjobs, right? That's how she knows his score, and doesn't care. -GHS
I spun on the sarcasm.

[Taichi]
"...you have put on a nice show of appearing like the detective. Are you the culprit then?"
//This borders on the psychic. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Do they teach you that in Senior High?"
//Taichi's still in Junior High, precise year unclear, possibly second or third by this point. See CCD0002, Sakuraba joins first year of Senior High and that's before Taichi ever comes to the club room. Polite form from the start, interestingly. -GHS

I had good confidence in the quality of the sarcasm I crafted.

[Misato]
"Aw, that is so harsh."
//Misato already seriously wounded Tomoki and caused her parents to divorce by now. Being called 'culprit' can't have been nice. -GHS
[Misato]
"But of course, my apologies."

But the irony of mine is all deflected.
//Although the term looks misused (since it's sarcasm), it's very ironic he'd strike at *just* the right spot to hurt her. So it's ironically not sarcasm? -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"I will explain the situation: this is precocious recruiting."
//See Taichi with Yusa. So if the two are so identical, and Misato knows very very very well how Taichi is, how did it end up differently? ...did it? -GHS
[Misato]
"I work with the Broadcast Club, therefore..."

[Taichi]
"I do know that."
[Taichi]
"Because I do hear all the noon broadcasts."

Whether I like it or not.

[Misato]
"Ahhh, then the discussion will be quick, yes. Yes, that is me. I am the noon DJ."
//...except it's noon break and she's nowhere near the club room. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I would not think you were good even if I were to try to flatter you, however."
//Harsh. -GHS

[Misato]
"...unskilled then... so you say..."

She wilts.

[Taichi]
"If you know that you are unskilled, then it is best to cease doing it."

Because I'm not used to conversation, I end up using oddly polite expressions.

[Misato]
"It is that we have been short-handed for so long!"

And suddenly, she offers to me the top of the palm of one hand.

[Misato]
"And that is why I wish entice you, Kurosu-kun."
//As in allure or seduce... like Youko did, in a sense. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"......heh."

My facial muscles were convulsing as if electricity were passing through them as I failed to make a sneering, nihilistic smile.
//TIL it's an actual synonym for 'sneer'. Wat. -GHS
...this just sucked.
//He can't manage to look nihilistic if he tries. Think about that for a second. -GHS
Equipping expressionlessness, I proclaim:

[Taichi]
"My apologies. Please ask of someone else."

I get up and leave.

[Misato]
"Ahhh, wait waiiit!!!"

............
These are activities that I began when she invited me,
and now,
she was rejecting me.
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS
Wednesday.
To school.
A gate to prevent desertion.
It seems to exist less to protect students, and more to protect the outside world from us.
That is the impression it left.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

I was welcomed by a distrustful gaze.

[Taichi]
"Oh, President."
[Taichi]
"Did you not get a hangover?"

[Misato]
"...get I did. AwChChCh!"
[Misato]
"That is not the point, it is that I have found myself sleeping in the infirmary, and the work still progressing... we are seeing the outbreak of an inexplicable phenomenon."
//Given Mura and Sato mean very similar things (small town, village), the Shi-Mura Phenomenon makes an odd companion to Mi-Sato. Especially shi=4 and mi=3, so that's a 7. Since Misato sees but pretends she doesn't, that's oddly appropriate. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That would be me."
//Indeed it seems to work both ways in the original. -GHS

[Misato]
"It was you?"

[Taichi]
"You have told me to do so, Senpai."

[Misato]
"Eh? Did I tell you that?"

[Taichi]
"Ehhh, I guess it is because of intoxication, right. You have no memory of it?"

[Misato]
"Aaah..."

And out come the worries.
While I'm there, I'll put her in some gratitude.

[Taichi]
"And then all of a sudden you started dancing naked, Senpai, and I was all thinking, oh what should I do."

[Misato]
"!?!?"

Senpai's eyes became an [><] mark in landscape orientation.

[Misato]
"AwAaAaAaH!"
[Misato]
"Me just doing something like that... I cannot believe it!"

[Taichi]
"It went something like this..."

[Misato]
"Hottt, 's hottt... cannot be wearing this!"
//lispy atsui desu. -GHS

While yet using the left hand to unfasten her necktie, three seconds later Senpai slants her right hand downwards at a 45 degree angle and inserts the index finger into the knot burying it up to the second knuckle in 0.62".
//That boils down to 8... but look closer! 45 is 4 and 5; 4+3 (seconds)=7, 5+2(knuckles)=7. The numbers 3 and 2 are even on the correct sides of the 4 and 5. The seven is harder to see than the 8, but more abundant. -GHS
The strength of her hands working from opposites exceeds the friction power of the necktie, and a length of approximately 32 centimeters of the part that slides around the neck was withdrawn from the knot.
//45 (angle from above)+32(cm)=77 -GHS
After that, via right hand in sequence the first button as well as the second button are unfastened in approximately two seconds, baring the breasts.
//1 (button) + 2 (button) + 2 (second) =5. Hum, but... wait, no, you're kidding me right? Right? No way... you have to carry the boobs. That's 5+2=7. My dear Tanaka, you have a perverted mind. Fortunately, I'm even worse. -GHS

[Misato]
"Theeere, pop-pop-pop!"
//Sounds of buttons being undone...? -GHS

Lowering the shoulder straps with both hands, then the right hand once again on to the buttons of the blouse, the left hand heading to undo the skirt's sidehook and zipper.
At elapsed four point twenty-eight seconds the blouse goes, at elapsed seven point thirty-four seconds the skirt.
//4,2[8 7],34 eight and seven are right next to each other. But! 4+2+8=14=7x2 and 3+4=7, so first number is twice seven and second is seven twice. Also: 7.34-4.28 = 3.14 mmmh pi (which is also 8). Now see CCA0007. PI-shape, you said? -GHS
Her form became underwearing.
//heeh heeh snort. Oddly, these next few are the only significantly removed lines in the PS2 version. -GHS

[Misato]
"I will also strip off the pantieees!"

On the precise moment of that 'also', they had fallen to the ankles.
She takes the feet off them, then letting the wind make sway of the pubic hair while unfastening the bra hook.
The swelling chest pushes out the cups, and the fabric leaps soft towards the cosmos. Incapable of attaining sufficient buoyancy to become a glider, it ends with a somersault to the ground where it coils as if a snake.
//where can you buoy a buy anyway -GHS
By now, Senpai's articles of clothing consisted in glasses, socks and shoes.
The glasses being part of the face, therefore this was in essence a Socks Nude.
//It is, naturally, a type of fetishism. That should go without saying. Compare the Hair Nude of his Intercranial Photoshop, see CCA0006. -GHS

[Misato]
"Somebody look at how I am here all bare naked, please, somebodyyy!"
//See CCA0002, CCC3004. Projecting much? -GHS

Extending both arms horizontally, she migrated by approximately six meters fifty-three centimeters spinning towards the left side at the rate of one revolution per second.
//Unfortunately I don't know how one would calculate the number of revolutions from that (math is hard, and then you die). OTOH, 1 (revolution)+6 (meters) =7, which is harder to see than 5+3 (cm)=8. So maybe it's not needed. -GHS

[Misato]
"Look at my true forms free of mosaiiics!"
//Now THIS is how you know he's talking out of his ass. -GHS

Unfortunately a mosaic censoring there was.
//Troll: there's just no CG. -GHS

[Misato]
"Laaaa lalalalaaaa lalaaa♪"
//"as you like". This is so less funny after Tower of Friends. -GHS

And these beautiful forms of Senpai I was staring at, with my wits at an end.
                                              ~THE END~

[Misato]
"...sob, sob, sob... I told you must not look, and you still looked!"
//She told him TO look, but that's the joke, see below. -GHS

She flops down, sitting at a slant, crying the tears of the Yamato Nadeshiko.

[Taichi]
"No, that is the Grateful Crane."
//http://www.xaviermissionaries.org/M_Life/WorldPlaces/Asia/JP_GrateCrane.htm what she means should be obvious from this. -GHS

[Misato]
"That depiction was so incredibly precise, was it even the truth!"

[Taichi]
"HAI."
//Cross Channel in two lines. -GHS

She breaks down crying.

[Taichi]
"But be at ease! This harmless young boy skillfully dealt with it, it has been cleaned up so that the public eye will never notice!"

[Misato]
"...ahhh, so you did... thank you, very much."

[Taichi]
"'Tis nooothing."
[Taichi]
"Also, I have also written the script."

[Misato]
"Eh? Did even ask you to do it already?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, please have a look."

The contents had been repurposed from the past ones.
//Even funnier now that I called a completely separate script file. -GHS

[Misato]
"Hummm... this is fine, yes."
//MISATO LIKES COPYPASTA -GHS

She raises her face and shows me a smile.

[Misato]
"It is so in our style."
//COPYPASTA NOM NOM -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sooo it is not failed then!"

A merry laughter in two. And shortly afterwards,
Senpai's face clouds.

[Misato]
"...and in the end, doing this alone is just impossible."

[Taichi]
"It was simply unreasonable."
[Taichi]
"No good staying up all night, then going about all mad during the day. It is forbidden."
//That fake tale probably struck her hard, but the problem he (justly) has is here is with her alcohol. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ngggh... the President getting a sermon by a Kouhai..."
//becuz cross channel's's' is a bible game, taichi (who is jesas) is a priest. -GHS

Senpai standing up, and simultaneously all the various tools and materials leaning about come into motion.
//Uh-oh, the material have started to move... -GHS
I pull her to me.

[Taichi]
"Careful!"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

The stepladder, the antenna radiators, the tools... all of them,
with a discordant musical performance scattered around the floor.

[Misato]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"So close that was so close!"
//Consider it's Tomoki, if anyone, that saves Misato when Taichi's not around. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah... th-, thanks..."

[Taichi]
"Seriously, look at this now!"

[Misato]
"Ah, b-, but..."

[Taichi]
"Do things with more care, this is dangerous!"

[Misato]
"...is it now..."

The smell of Senpai.
A memory gushes forth, carrying with it the realistic air of an early Summer, and faintly fills the tip of my nose.
//Compare him smelling her bra in CCA0015B, or being a smell fetishist really. The end of the Bathroom scene is also interesting. -GHS

[Misato]
"Good afternooon!"

A cold feeling on the nape of the neck as I was dozing off.
//According to CCD0022A, that's where "Youko" is sensitive. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...whoa, what's this?"

[Misato]
"It is time for some cold juice!"

Senpai was dangling down two cans.
//It's another one of those that sounds too suspiciously good in English... in fact, see CCC3022: what a suspicious change there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"My treat!"

[Taichi]
"......"

I was made to accept.

[Taichi]
"...you are a persistent one, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"I would think it best not to get too involved with me."

[Misato]
"Why is that?"

She sits next to me.

[Taichi]
"I really am a good-for-nothing, that is why."
[Taichi]
"If I let my guard down, I end up hurting people."
//But all he had done until then was kill the 14 at the Hasekura mansion (or maybe just started ignoring them and accidentally pushed Yutaka down the stairs). That was planned and carefully executed. He's avoided all human contact since then. How did that go into this? -GHS
[Taichi]
"...I have a dangerous personality, that is all."

[Misato]
"Ahhh... that seems so gloomy..."
//It is, unfortunately, not the eighties and therefore-- wait, I bought brand-new just-released copies of Archipelagos and Lords of Midnight (the first) not months ago, a new version of scratch'n'sniff was obsoleted not five years ago, 3D is on its way out of popularity, touch screens are everywhere, consumer VR helmets are in production... HOLY SHIT IT *IS* THE EIGHTIES!!! Less funny considering this history repeating itself is exactly what the major metameaning of the time loop in here means. Prescient, if sigh-worthy. And let's not talk about retro-oriented "8 bit" games that look and sound nothing like the actual games... I'm old enough to spot anachronisms in the real world, what the hell. -GHS

If she's looked through the register of names, then she ought have guessed.
It's jotted down in red ink, this name of mine.
//Hum, "diarized". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Club, you said? I do not think my participation would be authorized."
[Taichi]
"You are one of the people of this place after all... you should understand."

[Misato]
"Yes. That is why I tried to talk to you like this."

[Taichi]
"...but just by talking there is lots you cannot understand."

[Misato]
"I do have one thing I understood."

She raises one finger. Seriousness on her face.

[Taichi]
"...and it would be?"

[Misato]
"You have... a normalcy complex."

[Taichi]
"...!"

Right on the head. What skill at human discernment! Is it wisdom of the age?
By what process of accumulation and overlapping of thought was she even able to express things so accurately.
I trembled with fear.
//Note the sarcasm of these three lines ought to be interpreted as Taichi not actually believing this, although she is of course perfectly right. The only way to understand Taichi is through the eyes of others, and that is one major themes of the story. -GHS

[Misato]
"That is the face you are making..."
//Hmmm, but what was CCA0010 referring to then... -GHS

From my face?!
//Yeah, I don't think so. She's more likely rationalizing things... -GHS
I relaxed my muscles.

[Misato]
"In other words, you are in search for wholesomeness."
[Misato]
"...the same as I."

The girl showed me scars on her wrists.
//All together now! CRAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIN THESE WOUUUNDS DON'T SEEEM TO HEEAAAAL -GHS
They were fairly old, faint and almost vanished.
//IOW, she has abandoned this specific behavior years before. These scars should be compared to Taichi's own past. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...what is this?"

[Misato]
"Symptoms of self-mutilation."
//Seems more natural that he'd ask "this" and she's respond "these". -GHS
[Misato]
"People will not die just by cutting wrists, not unless significant preparations are made."
//AFAIK think laying in a hot bath would be enough, and that should be easy to procure in Japan. Then again, typical suicide there is jumping in front of a train... and it's not like Misato wants to die, really. It's that nasty habit of those too good for their own good that prefer to hurt the self than giving in to the otherwise unbearable want of hurting others. Which is one of the many reasons I strongly suspect Taichi's backstory as a murderer is largely hallucinatory. -GHS
[Misato]
"But when stress accumulates, I go and hurt myself."
//And since she understands him better than he does, it is all but declaring that he does the same. -GHS
[Misato]
"To me, the stress is... I cannot explain this well, but, it is about things not done on the dot."
//Hum. See CCB0002, CCC0006B, CCC3007. -GHS
[Misato]
"A room in disorder for example, or rules not observed."

[Taichi]
"Troublesome."
[Taichi]
"In this society that is a taste pretty much no one has, right?"
//See Kiri. -GHS

[Misato]
"That, yes indeed... it is full of causes of stress."
[Misato]
"When things will not work nor one way nor the other, I hurt myself..."
//Lit. "when I can't divide by 2 or 3 with an abacus". ...I mean, "when I'm at the end of my tether", but Misato therefore indirect. -GHS
[Misato]
"At times, I hurt others."
//See Yutak-- I mean, Tomoki. Except she didn't hurt him; he hurt himself trying to stop her from hurting herself, see below. Not that it matters to her... but since they're the same, does it matter to him? -GHS
[Misato]
"So that is the dilemma I have."

[Taichi]
"That is different from mine."
[Taichi]
"Mine is..."
//...see CCC3030. -GHS

I was hugged, softly.

[Taichi]
"Wa--"

[Misato]
"It is all right, if it is painful for you do not speak of it."
//See Nanaka. -GHS
[Misato]
"...either way, I am worthless myself."
[Misato]
"Still, at the same time, I am hard at struggle for my aim of normalcy."

[Taichi]
"Senpai... you are..."

[Misato]
"Radio waves flying past each other, the flaring flame of friendship, events of all kinds, and then, reconciliation... becoming ordinary is our aim, will you not try to do your best together with us?"
//"Tone as if making a speech". A really poor one, but it's sort of a good recap of the plot, in a sense. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"The Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club is currently recruiting boys lacking confidence and abundant in emotion!"

[Taichi]
"...so like a religious solicitation."
//Hooo boy he said it. Fallen Angel Misato indeed rescues him from this bit of hell he dumped himself into. -GHS

[Misato]
"And is religion not nice?"
//This route is where the religious part becomes all but explicit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Weird female."

[Misato]
"Come ON!"

[Taichi]
"...owCh!"

Headbutted.
//Yes, headbutt. She's still hugging him. -GHS

[Misato]
"You address your seniors with 'Senpai'!"
[Misato]
"Also, the price of the juice you are drinking now has come out of club expenses."

[Taichi]
"...that hits the mark."

[Misato]
"You have a duty to visit club, mister. Yes, you do."
//See CCB2009, Yume Miru Kusuri. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...those are the ways of the adults."

[Misato]
"We have few club members, and despite being a first grader I am but a low-ranking lady who cannot but fuss so very hard even at the details."
//Misato being 1st grade SH fits with Taichi being 3rd grade JH. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhm, but those gigantic boobs are pressing on me. Are sure you are OK with this posture?"

[Misato]
"Ah, you already have some interest in that kind of things?"

[Taichi]
"Well, of course, I am a man after all."

[Misato]
"My younger brother is still utterly a child you know."
//...brocon? More likely, HE has noticed her but SHE hasn't yet. -GHS

Way too vulnerable.
She's way too vulnerable.

[Taichi]
"...hahah."

I ended up laughing.

[Taichi]
"I'll join."

[Misato]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"...I will be joining."

[Misato]
"Eh, seriously serious?"

[Taichi]
"Because it is better than being solicited by the constant pressure of your boobs."
//That's not what "hot nuns are an incentive for joining the church" means, Tanaka. Jokes aside, her boobs cause his sexual urges to stimulate, which is what he knows to be his major problem. -GHS

[Misato]
"Waaah! I did it! I am so awesome!"

"You" did it you say...

[Taichi]
"It is the opposite."
//Supposing he didn't lay down there for an hour and a half, the flashback must've been really quick. Well, the whole thing's just a single day, so. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It is the opposite of that time."

[Misato]
"...that time...?"

[Taichi]
"Did you forget already?"

[Misato]
"Ahhh... that time, that thing?"

That Senpai that would be alright with pressing her chest into me...
The innocence of that time is now no more.
When hugged close, she stirs, flustered.
That's because Senpai has become aware of my being of the opposite gender.
That makes my heart leap a little.

[Misato]
"...I do feel something like this did happen."

[Taichi]
"You hugged me all of a sudden and shocked me, so this is tit-for-tat."
//fnarr fnarr, but more seriously also see CCA0010. -GHS

[Misato]
"That was... because, well, I was thinking you were a child."

[Taichi]
"If you are not more vigilant, you will get hurt!"

[Misato]
"...me getting hurt... is not a problem."
[Misato]
"It is better than hurting other people."
//See above, this is why she slashed at her wrists. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But somebody like you would never hurt others, Senpai, right?"
//At this point he doesn't seem to know why Tomoki can't run. -GHS

[Misato]
"......I do hurt them..."

Her voice getting hoarse, I began to nuzzle her forehead.
My one year older onee-san,
//See CCA0016, CCA0010, and below. -GHS
right now,
is so like an innocent little girl.

[Misato]
"Uhm..."

[Taichi]
"HOWAI?" (Why?)
//Been a WHAIRU. See CCA0021. -GHS

[Misato]
"How come I am being nursed when I have no injuries?"

[Taichi]
"Just in case you could possibly have managed to get some scratches or something, perhaps?"
//Simply Taichi repeating previous patterns as usual. -GHS

[Misato]
"Managed to get...?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, it is fine. You look a bit tired, so a bit more rest..."

[Misato]
"Sigh..."

[Taichi]
"Here, Senpai, your cell phone."

[Misato]
"Ah, thank you!"

[Taichi]
"You cannot use it but still you keep it close."

[Misato]
"...it makes me nervous... not having it around I mean."
[Misato]
"When I get a call, I want to ready to answer it immediately."
//Her cellphone rings at the end of her route, by the way, which meant it was charged and switched on. Nice continuity, one'd normally say, but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...a call?"

[Misato]
"From my family."

[Taichi]
"And your family, Senpai, would be..."

[Misato]
"In prison..."

[Taichi]
"EH?!"

[Misato]
"...he has been making a living as a criminal."
//Her father, her mother isn't in jail. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Th-, that is news to me though."

[Misato]
"He made a big splash with money misappropriation via tax evasion."
//Supposing it's the SFX and not the card game, since the misappropriation was for stuff including possibly study money and not to repay gambling debt as far as it seems. http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%89%E3%83%9C%E3%83%B3 It's stuff like this vaaague semi-subplot about the fairness of tax evasion that shows how subtly rebellious Tanaka really is. Remember how they installed Psychopath High in this super-rich place to "compensate" for its wealth? -GHS

So there were all kinds, it seems.

[Taichi]
"Me too I would become a sex offender, if I were not careful."
//See CCB0022. "Please laugh at me" -GHS

[Misato]
"...I'm not laughing."
//Ain't working. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So then."
//So he just moves on. -GHS

[Misato]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Please do be sleeping soon."

[Misato]
"Y-y-y-y-y-y-you want to do something perverteee〜d!"
//えx7 -GHS

[Taichi]
"How rude! That I will never be doing."
//Seems like an accent. -GHS

For now.
//The time needs to be right. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You should live in peace, Senpai!"

With the palm of the hand, I make her eyes close.
I come out to the corridor,
searching for Tomoki.
I was able to discover him quickly.
//He's hanging around the infirmary since he knows. -GHS
I call out to him.

[Tomoki]
"Oh, it's Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Worried about your nee-san?"
[Taichi]
"...eh, nah, not at all but... was there some accident?"
//See CCA002B, as well as below; he keeps tabs on her, that's how he's usually the one to rescue her - see CCC0041. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Besides, I've got nothing to do with her! Our parents are divorced."
[Tomoki]
"And the two of us are living with a different parent."

A different parent?
This family of four was split in half then?

[Taichi]
"So you are then. Which parent you with, Tomoki?"

[Tomoki]
"...mother."

[Taichi]
"Then Senpai's with her father?"

[Tomoki]
"Well, sorta..."
[Tomoki]
"But, what'cha been doing? Together I mean?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, I've been participating to club. Senpai's club."

[Tomoki]
"...why again?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, it's just, isn't it nice to be gunning for something?"

[Tomoki]
"Club activities, you mean that garbage?"

[Taichi]
"That ain't garbage."

[Tomoki]
"Well, if you're doing that, Taichi... then, well, there's gotta be a reason or something I guess."
[Tomoki]
"Who's else's participating?"

[Taichi]
"The Prez."

[Tomoki]
"...that's it?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."
//This doesn't make much sense here since Tomoki already knows Misato and Taichi are in club alone. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That ain't a club..."

[Taichi]
"If I think it's club then even 'self-consolation' is club."

[Tomoki]
"...I only knew there's been moving about here and there of late, so it was about club."
//From whom, here? The only one other people we know for certain are still here are Taichi and Youko. Of course, it's all a load. -GHS

I shrugged my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"But you're doing this too, Tomoki, if I may meddle in the poisoning of siblings."

[Tomoki]
"That's 'affairs'."
//姉弟水入らず http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1114139441 Going with a somewhat Tolkenian adaptation (becuz tolkines' the only one who ever said "meddling in the affers of" plus lords of teh ryng is a bible game 2). -GHS
[Tomoki]
"...sorry, man."

[Taichi]
"Right then."

[Tomoki]
"...you'll be betrayed."

Fragmentary, to say.

[Taichi]
"It's fine, no problem."

[Tomoki]
"Mh...?"

[Taichi]
"Is never being betrayed a prerequisite for trust?"

[Tomoki]
"Welll..."

[Taichi]
"And if it's about that, I'm already spoiled goods ain't I."

[Tomoki]
"You'd never turn traitor, Taichi, right?"

[Taichi]
"No and no, I have betrayed lots, and I'll be double-crossing lots, and furthermore I'll be intercrossing as well!"
//Seems just to be a bad pun, though last term also has 'breeding' as subtext. Remember the manga stuff alone, see CCA0007. And Tomoki even called him a traitor already! Just like Misato not quite remembering that hug she gave him, Tomoki doesn't quite remember how Taichi treated him... and let's not get into CCD0002 - damn, Tomoki really forgave everything of him. Or did he just forget too? See CCB0022, too. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...I'd never consider that as one of your typical high-level verbal jokes."
//Subtext is that it sucks. -GHS

I haven't said one.

[Taichi]
"A joke that is so much like a treasure can't just be made that often."
//AKA "well, some of them are going to suck". Some days I just want to choke the cheeky bastard. -GHS

That stuff's for fanatics of the Spray'n'Pray technique.
//Similar to CCC0007 http://kotowaza.avaloky.com/pv_hob06_02.html -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Anyhow, not getting really close would be better, OK? It's for your sake, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Nnnaaah, I wanna get close. I'll go all the way to where I wanna go."

Tomoki parts with color.

[Tomoki]
"Wh-, what... 'where' would be that..."

[Taichi]
"The goal!"
//Might be an Air reference, somehow, but that'd definitely be anachronistic. This might be with that "intercrossing" thing above means (provided there's anyone whore ad that as anything but "sex"). -GHS

[Tomoki]
"The goal..."

[Taichi]
"Penetration."

[Tomoki]
"Geh..."

That struck him.

[Tomoki]
"That's... but..."

[Taichi]
"Ya think too much, Immoral."

I slap his shoulder.

[Tomoki]
"I am Tomoki!"

[Taichi]
"Be more purely Immoral. It's for your sake."

[Tomoki]
"Rate of incomprehension at 95%."
//He IS a normal guy after all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Radio waves flying past each other, the flaring flame of friendship, events of all kinds, and then, reconciliation... becoming ordinary is our aim, will you not try to do your best together with us?"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"The Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club is currently recruiting boys with sexual desires incontrollable for their own older sisters!"
//PCP above, also similar as Miki to Kiri in CCC4001 -GHS

Words borrowed from Senpai.
I was thinking I would tell them to Tomoki, too.

[Tomoki]
"...really now."

Tomoki should be coming soon.
//I swear this segue wasn't intentional. Until I noticed it in final pass, that is. -GHS
I stand guard at the entryway.

[Tomoki]
"Tai---"

[Taichi]
"You got here at last. Thanks for the food!"

[Tomoki]
"Whoa, you gave me a scare... you're in a Kimono!"

[Taichi]
"Should be typical of a Master at Literature."

[Tomoki]
"You always dress like this?"

[Taichi]
"Assuredly."

[Tomoki]
"Awesome."

Seems Tomoki's respect for me has further grown.

[Taichi]
"Radio waves flying past each other, the flaring flame of friendship, events of all kinds, and then, reconciliation... becoming ordinary is our aim, will you not try to do your best together with us?"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"The Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club is currently recruiting boys with a Siscon Syndrome they can't be upfront about!"

[Tomoki]
"...say, that sentence... the part with 'radio waves flying past each other' sounds sorta weird, don't it."
//Did he hit meta too...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"How?"
//伝播? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"At Gunjou that's, well..."

[Taichi]
"In any one class, an average of ten people are wibble-wibbling radio waves, or Denpa..."
//See CCA0015B. This is also the reading key, since Taichi is Denpa. See CCZAS. Average class size in Japan is 30, so 1 out of 3 there is Denpa. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Ahhh..."

[Taichi]
"But that, as well, is something that's no more..."
//If this has really gone meta, then "the antenna has no interference anymore" = "I'm not bothering to notice anyone else, so the stuff I say isn't interfered by them anymore". -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Ahhh..."
//Notice he's not listening to this stuff at all. No reaction to "everyone's gone". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, anyhow I'm thankful for the food."

[Tomoki]
"Friendship demands---"
//Why even rerecord it? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nothing in return."

Tahm!
We laughed fearlessly as we stuck our thumbs up.
This should be the quota met.
//See CCA0016A/B -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Bye then."

[Taichi]
"Once you've got some breathing space on your side, won't you come to club?"

And on the very moment his expression hardened.

[Tomoki]
"...I don't really want to have club activities with traitors."
//And speaking of betrayal... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Cooo-ming!"
[Taichi]
"Who might it be?"

[Yusa]
"Ah, uhm, it's Doujima!"

[Taichi]
"A gangster-like surname associated with a conversely kyute voice... Yusa-chan? It's open, do come in!"

Slowly and carefully the door opens, and there stood a beautiful girl.

[Yusa]
"Hello, good eve... ning."

I let her sit, and lay out some barley tea.
We converse on many subjects.

[Yusa]
"Uhm, it's that today would be my birthday."

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, it was, right."

[Yusa]
"So then, here... a birthday present!"

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm... first of all, thank you. But, uh...?"

[Yusa]
"And also, I thought, so I could hand in the exchange diary tomorrow..."

[Taichi]
"So, first of all your exchange diary, and also, this is a birthday present from me."

[Yusa]
"......"

This young lady has the bad habit of losing words when surprised, don't she.

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's see you home."

[Yusa]
"............!!!?!?"

Her loss of words about doubled from before.

[Taichi]
"Well, it's night now, isn't it."
[Taichi]
"Shall we go?"

[Yusa]
"Ye-, yes!"

And so, I took her home.

[Yusa]
"That question... you just ask me that every time, right Taichi-san?"
[Yusa]
"That is a bit complicated so I do not really understand but... yes!"
[Yusa]
"Trainingful then!"

              It is indeed training.
                  Calisthenics.
             To reduce homesickness?
                 Not even close.
                    Violence.
                    Violence.
               Training in violence.
          Intense, turbulent, or furious
           and often destructive action.
Ahhh.
I really love those words, don't I!
I laugh so hard within my dream.
//Only technically, that one uses a more pretentious 'laugh', this one uses a normal one. -GHS
Without end.
Mockery.
Sinking sentiments that are quickly swallowed by the abyss.
The plating of a pretension that reminds of the nihility of cynicism dissolves, and the fragments that become bare... gather around the bodies of giant mothers and frolic.
One single thought:
an enemy is an enemy.
If killing needs be, killing it will be.
However, all thoughts like that I... want to well and truly kill---

*Bom* *Bem* *Bam* *Bom*
*Bom* *Bem* *Bam* *Bom*
This morning too, on the rooftop, club activities were proceeding strenuously.
I might have decided to join club, but the permission didn't come down all easy.
Senpai had to stir up all kinds for this.
Moving as to not be noticed by me.
...however I noticed this fast break but swift, haven't I.
Even if not as a member, participating to club activities was alright.
//No volition of opposition... no real excitement - yet. -GHS
Flowing into the mood of the moment, I ran my mouth and announced my joining.
Immediately repenting, I made an attempt to withdraw.
But... that was naive.
//Mostly on his part. -GHS
I was and pulled, and pulled,

[Misato]
"Kurosu-kuuun!"

and pulled, and pulled,

[Misato]
"Good afternooon!"

and continuously pulled in.
//As soon as he thought he was out... see CCX0001. -GHS
Before long, I ended up being often found in the club room.

[Misato]
"Uhmmm..."
[Misato]
"The moth-er-board's... slot... so the cable... like this, yes!"
//Going with sorta-misspelled to show how she doesn't really know what she's doing. -GHS

Truth was, Senpai was at the heart of club activities.
Because humans who could properly conduct activities...
...were the two of us alone.
//Tomoki's not joined yet, and Sakuraba keeps cutting (as his usual). So there ARE others (besides Miyuki)? Perhaps it's intended as a further hint: there are others, we just don't see them. -GHS

[Misato]
"The bay... in the bay... hardisc... ugggh, the cable won't fit in again..."
//This seems to mean that HDs are called HARD disks because they have porn in it, which ties to uhmmm am I drunk again...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...sigh."

I could not bear to watch.

[Taichi]
"Wrong. This way."

[Misato]
"Ah, you understand?"

[Taichi]
"...this part, yes."
//The part about putting tab A into slot B he understands. -GHS

[Misato]
"Then, uhm, what about this?"

[Taichi]
"If I may ask... why do you not buy one off the shelf?"
//Adoption agencies would probably look askance at two teenagers inquiring, especially ones diagnosed as psychotic. -GHS
[Taichi]
"If you have no knowledge at all of this, let us just buy one ready made."

[Misato]
"But I was thinking this should also be a part of club activities."
//Like the Penis on the rooftop. And the worst thing is, Tanaka is sufficiently perverted that I might not be reading too much into this. Think about that for a minute. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."

[Misato]
"Ah, that sounded like 'crick'..."
//There goes her virginity... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Careful, careful! Step aside, please!"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"If you do like that, then you will break all these precious expensive parts!"
//I think you can only do that if there's no lubrication, though getting the hole wrong may be--- wait, do rape nukige run ON computers, or IN them...? -GHS

[Misato]
"Ahhh, you saved us!"

The school's got money, so the components that were seemingly purchased on club budget were all top-grade.
//Bought by Misato, who doesn't know much about them. Well, she went for either 'expensive' or 'whatever Tomoki suggested her', not that this isn't a sex metaphor. Also would explain where she could get the materials to redo the antenna over and over. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ehhh. You have good skills, you do!"

[Taichi]
"Well, as much as anyone else."

Sarcasm...
//"You're less than normal" -GHS

[Misato]
"Eheheh, my younger brother is good with computers too!"

...did not go through.

[Taichi]
"...so he is, then."

[Misato]
"Boys, am I right!"

[Taichi]
"You like them younger, maybe?"

[Misato]
"Yes, I find younger boys adorable!"

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"I also like them older ladies, yes."
//A reminder that Lolicon is a Disease. -GHS

Sarcasm #2.

[Misato]
"I do not dislike them, however, older ladies cannot become objects of affections, never."
//I *think* she's more meaning in the sense that "you can't love your literal aunt" than "ain't gonna happen, buddy", but with Misato it's hard to tell even now that she allegedly doesn't realize consciously what's going on. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That is obvious!"

And I accidentally got all worked up.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"Ahhh... Peke-kun... KYAH!"

Senpai on top of the ladder steps, with a
baplump!
she fell down.
Her fall stopped with a Princess Carry in my arms.
//It googles, plus there's below. -GHS

[Misato]
"Whoa... wah-wah-wah?!"

[Taichi]
"An emolument of your kindness to others."
//Still the Grateful Crane. Interesting with CCA0021. -GHS

I quickly let her down.

[Misato]
"...th-, thanks!"

[Taichi]
"The way you fell just now was just like a plump caterpillar, Senpai."

[Misato]
"...do not make me imagine that, please!"
//The term GISs to pearl necklaces. -GHS

Grimacing + blushing

[Taichi]
"So that reminds me, there are no insects here, are there."
//ACTUAL pearl necklaces, you pervert! Tho that might be even creepier... -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes, that is at least a bit of salvation..."
//Careful now: she doesn't say there are no SOUNDS of them, just no insects. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But those cicadas are best off silent, right."
//The question can easily be read as a conditional, "it would be best if". -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"That reminds me---"

So surrounded by nature this town, every year it is visited by the noise of so many cicadas.
//おとなう -GHS
The are also lots of other insects around here.
Chubby rhinoceros beetles, for example, sometimes are found to be clinging so sad to house walls.
//Dunno why they're sad. -GHS
In looking at that kind of things in urban areas, of course those white larvae that so remind of fried shrimp would dream of the moment of release from the mountains in which they are buried, scattered.
//A 'liberation from the town' aspect seems to fit, but it's a very odd moment to bring this up. I suspect the connection is with the Sakuraba thing about larvae and fossils, see CCD0002. -GHS

[Taichi]
"When I was talking about these things in the cafeteria while eating fried shrimp, I ended up in a struggle with a spork-wielding Touko."
//He totally told Touko that fried shrimp were insect larvae. Hum, this would be a weapon then, which is used in the Sakuraba context mentioned above. -GHS

[Misato]
"...pft."
[Misato]
"Ahahahahahaha!

It might be just a thing of two people, but our club is fun.

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

A presence.

[Misato]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing, just gotta go to the latrine."
//Lit. "uncleanliness", so this is a closer term than 'lavatory'. -GHS

[Misato]
"My, old style word."

On opening the door that continues into the school,
there is a sound of panicky footsteps coming from the direction of a floor below.

[Taichi]
"That wasn't Youko-chan wasn't it..."

The method of presence erasure is clumsy.
Which amounts to,

[Taichi]
"Tomoki... then."

Damn that SIStem CONponent bastard can't be upfront.
//Pronunciation differences, unfortunately. -GHS
Well, I'll just go on to the toilet for now.
Pyyyy. (-ing)

[Taichi]
"Whew."

[Youko]
"...espied."
//Speaking of old fashioned words... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoa, she appeared!"

The real deal.

[Youko]
"Piggyback."
//See CCA0015B -GHS

[Taichi]
"...eh?"

[Youko]
"Cradling."
//The position that GIS off of this are... ambiguous, to say the least. They involve cats. And bunnies. -GHS
[Youko]
"Princess carry."
//Right above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...the hell's that."

[Youko]
"All the ways that Taichi has carried that eyeglassed female."

[Taichi]
"Eyeglassed female, really..."
//See CCD1001B. -GHS

[Youko]
"There have been a wide variety and types of carries in her regard."
//"I am not resetting". -GHS

[Taichi]
"...and you saw them all?"

Looks like she's seen 'em.

"I understand very well what you're trying to say..."

"...you wanna do that then... when you're this old?"

"Age is irrelevant."
//Peter Pan syndrome, anyone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you can survive even if no one carries you like a princess."
//See CCD5001. This is one of the things Taichi's subtly wrong about Youko, rarely enough: yes, she can survive, but is that a life worth living for her? -GHS

Youko-chan was expressionlessly disappointed.

[Taichi]
"More importantly, there's some part I'd like you to help with, so... you're more of an expert on that stuff, right Youko-chan?"

[Youko]
"Princess carry."

Ooo-kay.

[Taichi]
"...we're in negotiations, right?"

Nod.

[Taichi]
"I getcha, let's do it. Should be all right."

[Youko]
"Bridal princess carry."
//This would be the seventh time she says "princess carry". But she can't. There is something more that doesn't fit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I can't do something you arrange in a way that makes its meaning incomprehensible."
//Technically it seems just redundant, and he probably objects to the 'bridal' part. ...except, he just the eight carry she mentions to be incomprehensible, didn't he now. -GHS

[Youko]
"Normal is fine..."

[Taichi]
"Well, hop on."

[Youko]
"......"

She looks so delighted.
...but don't be fooled.
Cooozily.

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"...howsit?"

[Youko]
"...good."

[Taichi]
"Then, letting you down."

[Youko]
"No good, no good..."

Hurried panic.

[Taichi]
"More?"

[Youko]
"More."
[Youko]
"I cannot be satisfied with just this..."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

This girl here is fairly on the heavy side, so it's really tough, though.
Muscle is heavier than fat.
//Like a pound of bricks is heavier than a pound of feathers. This I'm not certain it's troll, because after all, this is true by volume. -GHS
These are the terrifying specifications of the children of the next generation.
//Wonder if Mammoth was one of the inspirations for her Super Ninja skills. -GHS
...'next generation' are words with an odd meaning, aren't they.
//Can't find any pun, so it's probably the usual no-one-there (combined maybe with "oh shit children with Youko"). ...or maybe it's how people keep referring to Next Generation consoles like two years after introduction... -GHS

[Touko]
"Stroll."

[Taichi]
"A stroll, really..."

But if this girl here had been like this from the start, then I would've been able to fall in love a little more honestly, just a little.

[Youko]
"...good."

[Taichi]
"Ach so."
//http://youpouch.com/2011/05/02/181215/ Not that I would've translated this any differently anyway, as it's needed for the fruitification of his Third Reich. -GHS

However it goes, I can see through her tactics.

"No."

[Taichi]
"...mngggh!"

And from there, I strolled her for an adequate ten minutes throughout the school.

[Youko]
"Still more..."

[Taichi]
"How much would it take for satisfaction I wonder, as far as regards to time?"
//See CCA0009B -GHS

[Youko]
"Approximately one hour, no more."

[Taichi]
"My arms will tear off!"

Dethronement.
//From the Princess Seat. -GHS

[Taichi]
"All done."

[Youko]
"...sigh."

She's discouraged.
No avoiding this. I should just give her some Sexual Harassment of Love.

[Taichi]
"Then I'll do something for you in exchange."

[Youko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"There's this one thing I wanted to try once."

[Youko]
"And it is?"

[Taichi]
"Reverse Shoulder Carry."
//Carry 8. -GHS

[Youko]
"Don't understand what you mean."

[Taichi]
"Be reminded of the normal shoulder carry, please."
//Formal for this part. -GHS

[Youko]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"In normally conditions, the knees of the person carried are pointed in a direction identical to the head of the person carrying, therefore pointing forwards, but..."
[Taichi]
"Give this a quick inversion, so that they are made to be pointing backwards."
[Taichi]
"Also, the direction of the person doing the carrying does not change."
//For those of you who get things a little bit late, he's talking about giving head while standing up. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Reverse Shoulder Carry."

[Youko]
"............"
[Youko]
"...Taichi's ero-power is unfathomable."

[Taichi]
"Thank you. Well, let's do it!"

[Youko]
"...that is... an extremely... embarrassing thing to do, I think."

A rare hesitation.
//She's weak to being given head? -GHS

[Taichi]
"O.K., then I'll ask Mimi-senpai, how about?"

[Youko]
"Crouch down..."

So simple.
Though it's not like I would expect Mimi-senpai to give her understanding to this.
//Agree to do it + understand what that means. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Weee."

Youko-chan stands in front of me.

[Youko]
"...then..."

The thighs rode on my shoulders,
one after the other.
And then, Reverse Piggyback implemented---

[Taichi]
"Woooo..."
[Taichi]
"Oooooooo..."
//x8... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Woooooooooooo..."
//x12, +5 (two lines above)=17 1+7=8 -GHS

No regreeets!!!
If I remember correctly, Tomoki had also been in a fight with Mimi-senpai last year, too.
//This was likely their parents' divorce. Interesting that Wacchi Taichi doesn't know about all this, though I'm leaning towards simple plot hole for this one. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"It's just that onee-ch--- aneki betrayed me..."
[Tomoki]
"I joined the Broadcast Club, but you know, I was forced. I thought I'd join the Going Home Club, but she went all, 'you are a PC boy therefore you ought come to help', and all that."
[Tomoki]
"Why do I even have to go and get all along with Aneki and have happy club activities after all that!"

Last year and now, as well.
Twice they have gone into discord.
//See Taichi and Yutaka on this. -GHS
But there was a very significant difference in the nature of the these two times.
//Meaning Tomoki forgave Misato for hurting him, even though he doesn't want much to do with her (not ununderstandably), much like Taichi and Sakuraba. -GHS
And then today, one year later.
//Today is the anniversary of Yutaka's death, so it seems odd it'd mean "to the day". -GHS
Tomoki was eating his bread, alone.

[Taichi]
"...yoh."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah... if you wanna bread there's some left there."
[Tomoki]
"Might've spoiled or something though, dunno."

[Taichi]
"Yup."

It's not gonna have spoiled,
but there's nothing but curry bread.
//No comment on the quantity. Of course, Sakuraba might be gone, therefore... -GHS
Naturally, straight in the middle of them...
There it is, croquette bread.

[Tomoki]
"What, there was that too?"

[Taichi]
"Your investigations are inadequate."

[Tomoki]
"...wanna exchange?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Tomoki]
"Thank you."

Tomoki ate the croquette bread.

[Taichi]
"...you know, that bread comes out of the Broadcast Club budget."
//Not a copypasta, not even partial. And I bet that's true. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Bfth, don'tcha lie!"
[Tomoki]
"This is just bread from the cafeteria!"
//That doesn't mean he hasn't paid for it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You have a duty to help club now."
//sooorta PCP -GHS

These are Senpai's tactics.

[Tomoki]
"Toldja no!"

[Taichi]
"...stubborn guy."
//See CCC4025 -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I don't got any reason to help, don't I."

[Taichi]
"How 'bout 'family'?"

[Tomoki]
"...no, but I told you..."

All at once the fatigue comes to the surface.
I knew that too, so I can tell.
All sorts of every single thing go into human relationships,
//Seems just a variant of ありとあらゆる -GHS
so that unserious, light attacks become pleasant.
Excessive strength means harm, but,
fundamentally, for person to touch person all methods are necessarily attacks.
Companionship, I think, is nothing more than skillfully going easy on others.

[Taichi]
"But just once in a while's fine, right?"

[Tomoki]
"...you're persistent today ain't cha. Not Taichi-like, that."

Indeed it isn't like me.

[Tomoki]
"Isn't loving people the way they are sort of your career?"

[Taichi]
"'The way people are'..."
[Taichi]
"Y-, you... you want to be loved by me then?"
//See CCA0029. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That was not meant literally!"
//See CCA0006, this is where it comes from. -GHS

Clowning around, reciprocal self-destruction, those are not attacks.
//I think this is actually denying much of the Fighting Is Love theme... to which I agree with, so very much. -GHS
I know. All of it.
I'm making noise at the entranceway, nothing more than one of those traditional Japanese sandwich board advertisers, the Chindonya.
//It googles. -GHS
To me so incapable at the treading into others' territories, I could do nothing but assent to everything about my partner.
//It's so damn weird put this way, but he means Alter Egos. -GHS
Means outside of those I haven't... normally.

[Taichi]
"Ah well, poking over there'd hurt anyway."

But right now---

[Tomoki]
"...you'd best be careful too, Taichi, I'm serious."

[Taichi]
"How come?"

[Tomoki]
"You'll just be betrayed."

[Taichi]
"If you don't show me some precedent as example I can't get it."

[Tomoki]
"...you'll just be sold."

[Taichi]
"For how much?"
//30 silvers, of course. Hey, see CCA0028. What was her supposed adaptation coefficient...? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"It doesn't feel like you're listening seriously though..."

[Taichi]
"...sorry... I find serial moods to be sorta embarrassing..."

[Tomoki]
"SERIOUS!"
//See CCC3004, but 'serial' works better here. Lots of stuff in series, definitely. -GHS

He pounds the table.

[Taichi]
"Don't have a cow now. It's like you're in that time of the month dammit."

[Tomoki]
"I'm a man! You Azuki loser!"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, you don't talk about Azuki Beans speculatiooon!"
//Part 7 and last of Taichi the Failed Speculator ~fin~ But http://diarize.blog48.fc2.com/blog-entry-12.html asks the question: since there's 小豆 (Azuki), what about 大豆 (soy) beans? One is written with kanji for small, the other for big. I don't think Tanaka used this pun, tho. Curiously, there's Youkai that's always found washing Azuki beans, which might tie it further to Youko. -GHS

My trauma for eternity.
//http://www.agmrc.org/commodities__products/vegetables/azuki-beans/ has a bit more. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"K'noooh!"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Queneau sounds unrelated. -GHS

[Taichi]
"M'gaaah!"
//"Muga" is self-renunciation. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"iEyAAAH!"

[Taichi]
"Ch'eysaaah!"
//"Chaser"? These four are a bit odd to be just random grunts, but I'm finding nothing. -GHS

Scratches inflicted reciprocally, with agreement at their base, become the abundance of the heart,

[Voice]
"...keee-kuuun...!"

Senpai had come.
Measurement error is about five minutes or thereabouts.
//Damn, she's a swiss clock. -GHS
If she delayed ten minutes or more, I was thinking of going to see what was going on.

[Taichi]
"Yeee-es!"

[Misato]
"Good eveniiing!"

Beneath the window stood the girl with a bag hanging from her hands.
//hurr hu- OK, that's too much even for me. -GHS
And then, on schedule, we eat packed lunch.

[Taichi]
"Delicious!"
[Taichi]
"You are really skilled at this Senpai!"

[Misato]
"Am I now? But I only really started to cook recently..."

A silly little conversation.
And then,

[Misato]
"Ah... nhhh...!"

Joining.
I faithfully recreate the shape of this act that I have phenomenally repeated.
Being so experienced in this, the agony I gave her was, likely, little.

[Taichi]
"Could we still go to the beach, tomorrow?"

An invitation.

[Misato]
"...indeed, yes."

Bashfulness.
There existed a territory, one that I could not reach with the mere overlap of bodies.
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Friday, then."

There remain three days to the swingback of the world.
Let's do what's expected of us today, as well.

[Taichi]
"Senpai, I have been waiting for you!"

[Misato]
"...Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"We promised to go to the beach, you did not forget right?"

[Misato]
"Beach... but I did not make arrangements!"

[Taichi]
"I made the arrangements! Come come, let us have our departure!"

[Misato]
"But... the broadcast channel cannot be later than Sunday..."

[Taichi]
"I have called in an assistant."
//Interesting he'd switch to a pseudo flashback for this, isn't it. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And therefore, I leave this in your good care so we can go to the beach."

[Youko]
"...I have never gone to the beach with Taichi."
//See CCA0027. Minor inconsistency, or lie? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Next time, 'K?"
[Taichi]
"For now, Youko-chan, you'll be continuing broadcast preparations all in solitude under this scorching sun. Ah, coming to supervise us is also forbidden, OK?"

[Youko]
"...just exploited as convenient..."
//Very Tomoki, isn't it? Maybe that's what it is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It suits you very well."

Senpai shakes her head feebly.

[Misato]
"...I do not think so at all..."
//Yet she wore it instead of, oh, going to Atomic GS which is like right next door and getting another. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Would be a great big waste to hide all this charm inside a towel."

[Misato]
"But I look like a slut now..."
//Curiously, they've kept this doll for the PS2 version. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That is very much not true!"
[Taichi]
"These chaste forms of yours, Senpai, are incredibly exciting to me."

[Misato]
"Then am I making you aroused am I not!"

[Taichi]
"But whether it suits you or not, this is certainly the best match!"
[Taichi]
"Ask one hundred perverted men, and to a one they will say it suits you!"

[Misato]
"Please go ask some non-perverted men as well!"

[Taichi]
"No such thing as a non-perverted man!"

So I shouted, stretching my arms out wide.

[Misato]
"This is not dreamy..."
//Heh, see CCB2012 -GHS
[Misato]
"Ahhh, I am a slut... so embarrassing..."

'I am a slut, I am a slut', Senpai keeps saying.

[Taichi]
"Be unembarrassed now. Calling yourself a 'slut' is nothing but an inconceivable mistake."
[Taichi]
"It is merely that you are abnormally aroused by your wearing a perverted swimsuit for the first time, Senpai, nothing more."
//See CCD0022, CCC4009 -GHS

[Misato]
"That is what a slut does! Also, you are an idiot!"

Uh-huh.

[Taichi]
"You are a slut, Senpai, and I am an idiot. We go well in a duo."

[Misato]
"I knew it, you just want me to become a slut..."
//But that's totally what she wants. As mentioned above she DID wear the damn thing. The lady doth protest too much. -GHShakespeareQuoteWooo

[Taichi]
"Remember last year, let's do some beach volley!"

This year we'll jiggle to the end.

Boobs = volleyball.
That equation has not the even the tiniest of errors.

[Taichi]
"Catch!"

[Misato]
"Ngggh..."

[Taichi]
"S'yah!"

[Misato]
"Ah, wah..."

[Taichi]
"Senpai, why are you receiving with only one arm?"

[Misato]
"Because I can feel a gaze on me."

[Taichi]
"Even when there is no one here but the two of us?"
//September at a dormitory of a town in the middle of the mountains. Nothing strange about it. Remember how long the life guard took to get out there. -GHS

[Misato]
"That would be the gaze of the remaining person!"

Well then, I'll simply have to return the ball in a way that can't be received without both hands.

[Taichi]
"E'hy, Miracle Split Ball!"
//Doesn't seem to be a specific reference. -GHS

[Misato]
"Wh-, what?!"
[Misato]
"...ah, ah, really!"

Senpai used both hands,
Boioin'.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh!"

Perfectly balanced beautiful breasts take vertical motions with a time lag.
//I so wanna call that Milk Time. -GHS

[Misato]
"I feel like I am being defiled by eyes..."

Mentally acute person, her.

[Taichi]
"Diabolical Ball You Unconsciously Want To Hit Back!"

[Misato]
"Aaah, Good Pitch You Want To Very Moderately Hit Back!"
[Misato]
"Enough, e'hyyy!"

Shake'n!

[Taichi]
"Doing something with others is always fun!"

[Misato]
"Well now, for you at least this is fun..."

[Taichi]
"I mean club activities!"

[Misato]
"...club?'

[Taichi]
"There are no more people now, it has all became so quiet, and there is almost nothing left anymore."
[Taichi]
"And still, so much fun."
[Taichi]
"Doing something together with someone is fun."
[Taichi]
"When you are alone, it becomes hard even to breathe, right?"

[Misato]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"You do not think that boring, Senpai?"

[Misato]
"...it is not tedious."
//Not the same word. -GHS
[Misato]
"...but... I..."

[Taichi]
"You...?"

[Misato]
"I do not want to think about anything!"

Toss.
She raises the ball up high, where it draws a narrow arc.

[Taichi]
"...why?"

I return the ball in the same way.

[Misato]
"Simply that I wish to become used to be someone that just does things."

[Taichi]
"Like a robot then?"
//See CCA0016. Little wonder she had a word for robot. This is the inhuman thing she wants to become, like Taichi wants to be an insect underneath it all. -GHS

[Misato]
"Indeed."

[Taichi]
"That is lonesome."

[Misato]
"...I thank you for the feelings, however."

[Taichi]
"But humans just cannot become robots, can they?"
//Well, Michael Jackson can in MoonWalker, see CCD3003. ...I can't actually believe that connects to anything, but I suspect it does in this sense. -GHS

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"When it's time to have fun, you just got to have fun, that's what I say."

I gave the ball a conspicuously high launch.

[Misato]
"I do not have the flexibility to do that..."

Shoulders fall,
Pteng, and the ball fell.
//Balloon tension? Maybe, but on the sand-- wait, I don't care, NVM. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Senpai?"

And with a face looking like it had aged a decade,

[Misato]
"This might just be my retribution, perhaps."
[Misato]
"For... the things I have done."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"I... do not have the qualifications to be all adolescent, to play around, seriously."
//See CCC0006A. More and more like Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...is your sin that heavy, Senpai?"

[Misato]
"Yes it is..."

[Taichi]
"That seems... unlikely."

[Misato]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"I am saying, Mimi-senpai, that for the level of person that you are, perpetrating something so sinful seems unlikely."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun... when you do not know people's circumstances at all, going and saying that is... not nice. Not when I only conceded you my body once..."

[Taichi]
"But Senpai, in the end you just seem to be running away."

I walk over and pick up the ball.

[Misato]
"What's that even...!"

[Taichi]
"The club is for your escape, right?"
[Taichi]
"But this is odd, is it not? To escape even when the world has become this rarefied."
//Since the only family that hangs around her is Tomoki and she spends all her time in the club room or with that antenna, she has no one around her but the people in the club. The disappearance of mankind wouldn't touch her in the slightest, meaning also that she could easily play into Taichi's game if a game it were. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Escape even when criminals and sinners, regret and repentance, suffering and distress... all of it, all has vanished together with people themselves."
[Taichi]
"The composition and the structure of sin and crime are both no more."
//See CCA0021. This is erroneous, of course: God's game, God's rules; but Sendback is also for Taichi to learn, not just everyone else. -GHS
[Taichi]
"This thing known as 'morality' is now infinitely approaching the 0, you know?"
//Loop. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And you keep obstinately dragging that along, Senpai."
