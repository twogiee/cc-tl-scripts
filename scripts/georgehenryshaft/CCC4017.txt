Early morning.
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS
I came to club by inertia.
The preparations for our Broadcast Station still had quite a long ways to go.
Tomoki was among us.

[Taichi]
"Morn'."

[Tomoki]
"...Taichi, then."

[Taichi]
"What's up?"

[Tomoki]
"...this, ya know, I was thinking that most of it was already finished."

[Taichi]
"Well, this is Senpai doing her best."
[Taichi]
"She's even carrying up the machine parts she needs."

[Tomoki]
"...when was she going to finish this?"

[Taichi]
"Sunday, wasn't it? I think. That was the initial plan."
[Taichi]
"Wanna help?"

[Tomoki]
"Nah, got stuff to do, so..."

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba, yannow, he went on a trip."

[Tomoki]
"So like him."

[Taichi]
"I was invited."

[Tomoki]
"Yup, me too."

[Taichi]
"Afterwards, I became a billionaire somehow..."

[Tomoki]
"Ehhh?"

Reaction's weak.
There's something else he's preoccupied with.

[Taichi]
"Touko died by the way."

[Tomoki]
"......what... are you talking about."

Face twitches.

[Taichi]
"Juuust kiddin'!"

[Tomoki]
"Really youuu!"

[Taichi]
"Will you let me off easilyyy!"

[Tomoki]
"...let's stop. I'm not in that mood."

He goes to return inside the building.

[Taichi]
"Won't you participaaate?"

[Tomoki]
"...I'm fighting with Aneki ya know."

[Taichi]
"Senpai comes in late, so come help us even if it's only before noon!"

[Tomoki]
"Hummm... you got some things you don't get?"

[Taichi]
"Just a biiit on the wiring of the machinery."

[Tomoki]
"I just gotta, right."

Tomoki came to assist us only throughout the forenoon.
