Well then now.
Club activities are left in the hands of others, so,
shall I not go recover Touko?
//formal for some reason -GHS
I'll go by car.
I scrounged a key from the staff room, and I now search for the matching car.

[Taichi]
"Ouch..."

A tragedy had taken place in the parking area.
It's as if a rampant driver had performed repeated hit-and-runs, over and over.
//暴走. Remember it... -GHS

[Taichi]
"They're all dented..."

Here we have a torn-off bumper,
there a tree was splintered,
//Hard to tell without seeing much about the kind of trees, but if it were to be cut in half or something the odds the car would still work are low. -GHS
cracks in that front radiator...

[Taichi]
"...Tomoki-sensei..."

Tomoki had a lack of driving talent that reached the divine.
//Literally, as he still drove off with what is implied to be zero instructions or practice at all. The reason he's "normal" is that he can learn to drive manual pretty damn quickly, all things considered. He shares this with Yutaka, who also has a foot on 'manual' (see CCA0011C, where this driving metaphor properly began). Sakuraba rides the bike, so it's unlikely he asked him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Truly, amateurs on that 'mission aren't gonna make it, keh keh keh!"
//Mission OR transmission, see CCA0003 - amateurs rejected! -GHS

When it comes to myself, however, I really know how to ride these things.
Is it just the difference in our levels of humanity?
//17% vs 84%. Likely. -GHS
I get on the car that fits the key.
//The whole scene was massacred in the PS2 version because they removed him actually getting on a car and driving. Taichi, there, is apparently somehow driving his own self, and is utterly surreal idea. -GHS
I am a man, therefore the 'mission, naturally,
is automatic.
It's a vehicle for women and children, they say.

[Taichi]
"Pah, I'm gonna show you now!"

I was rough and wild.
There's also a bit of the war horse, gallant in the face of battle.
//I can only suspect it's also a reference to [龍馬/竜馬]のつまずき, "even the best horse stumbles". -GHS
I magnificently accelerate from a half-clutch position.
//That's a manual gear driving technique. -GHS
Dammit, I just bumped into that car in front of me!
Good thing I fastened my seatbelt.
For now let's back out.

[Taichi]
"Back Isshimatsu, Back Isshimatsu, and..."
//Can't find anything but a pun on this: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%83%E3%83%84%E7%9F%B3%E6%9D%BE (English term returns it within first few results) -GHS

Overcoming the tire stops I break into the shrubbery on the back.
//I think it's just part of the parking space, only specifically intended to prevent, well, the above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Baddo this is〜"

This kind of mistake isn't a one in a million. A Hyper Rare Event.
Reee-try.
Dammit, it was still in reverse gear.
Multiply one in a million by one in a million... how much's even that.
//Either 1 in a billion or 2 in a hundred. Dunno; math is hard. -GHS
Ah, who cares.
I'm so miraculous I could just sparkle.
//This is likely literally true. -GHS
And that car even looks so expensive... sorry, Currently-Deceased Professor Sakakibara.
I head forwards.
Whoa, whoa, woah the handbrake was still engaged.
//He had to have pressed that accelerator down to the metal to get it to move at all so far. Handbrake is "sidebrake" in Japanese, so in the PS2 version it reads "the side was still engaged". WTF. -GHS
Disengage.
Boom, the car accelerates suddenly.
//Although automatic cars crawl forwards when not in brake, he likely had the accelerator down. -GHS
Grazing the noses of the cars parked in the rows, and ripping off the bumper.
I'm pretty efficient at destruction dammit.
No waaay, I did something really nasty to the headmaster's Ferrari.
//Shinkawa's catchphrase... PS2 version talks about "that expensive war horse". ...then again, since this likely happens only in his mind... -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

Ah, who cares. F'ing in this dangerous school is improper.
* F'ing = Taichian. Two meanings:
   1) being an owner of a Ferrari;
   2) (complete snip).
//I guess it now sounds more like 'fucking' than 'fellatio', but, eh, who gives a blowjob. -GHS
Slow forwards. Turn right.

[Taichi]
"Awesome."

Engine stalled.
//I can't even think how that would happen in automatic transmission short of catastrophic engine dam-- ohhh. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
//...one in a quadrillion? -GHS

Start again.
Reverse.

[Taichi]
"..."

But I think that, through and through, seatbelts really are indispensable.
//Remember kids: don't be Taichi and drive! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Undauntedly GO!"
//"Boom". -GHS

The car did not move anymore.

[Taichi]
"...hm-hmmm."

My biorhythms seem to be off today.
//Judging by the extent of the Wikipedia JP article (stub), this stuff doesn't seem particularly popular in Japan. So more Japanese vs. American thing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But damn, Japanese cars are so fragile!"

The idea that this car would ever be deployed to the police in the West is but dream within dream.
The best they could do is get wrecked by water cannon fire engines, and no more.
//Term's relatively generic, but: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A0%B4%E5%A3%8A%E6%A9%9F%E6%95%91%E9%9B%A3%E6%B6%88%E9%98%B2%E8%BB%8A <- guessing. It sounds like a movie reference, no idea. Some of those fire engines that I see GISing around look like they could just trample on cars, too. -GHS
Youko-chan knocked on the window.

[Taichi]
"...what?"

I open the window.

[Youko]
"Get out."

I get out.

[Youko]
"Wait here."

[Taichi]
"...'k."

I pass the time by embarrassedly spiraling my finger in the ground in the shape of the 'no' hiragana, until a car came smoothly riding out from the back.
//Unsure how popular that is to do these days, I actually haven't seen it done that often, so specified a bit. See CCX0001. -GHS
Driving without hesitation, it stops right in front of me.

[Youko]
"Get on."

I get in the passenger's seat.

[Youko]
"Where do you want to go?"

[Taichi]
"...castle Kirihara, if I may graciously impose."
//Well and formal. -GHS

I was being taken there.
And so it was that I became filled with sad feelings.
