[Taichi]
"Here."

I hand over the paper bag.
But as far as food goes, she's someone who can just make as much as she wants, inn'she.

[Youko]
"Mh..."

She begins to eat.

[Taichi]
"Well, bye."

I walk away.

[Youko]
"..."

Scarf, scarf, scarf.
//Eating hurriedly + scarves are important in winter, make sure to dress up before going outside! -GHS
She followed while still eating...
Therefore, I decided teasing will ensue.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Youko-chan, c'mere."

I summon her.
Grabbing her head, I push hard into her hair whorl.
//Uhm, going with 頭を抱えて being literal. As for the second part... http://yushima-s-clinic.com/index.php?%E3%81%A4%E3%82%80%E3%81%98%E6%8A%BC%E3%81%97 <-?????????? -GHS

[Youko]
"Ngh, ngggh, not that please... not that... it makes my belly want to empty..."
//http://translationbykako.com/2010/12/09/10-strange-japanese-superstitions/ <- #6. And, ah, see CCA0015 I suppose. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But this is health itself you know."
//Given that uhhh two links above... -GHS

Squeeze! Squeeze! I squeeze it down.

[Youko]
"Uhhh, the whorl... don't push it please... makes the top of the head feel weird..."

Slowly-slow I spiral into the flesh.
She won't escape.

[Taichi]
"Rubbity rubbity!"
//See CCC0041 -GHS

[Youko]
"Uncle, uncle."

The early afternoon bullying had been carried through.
