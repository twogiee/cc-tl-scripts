[Taichi]
"Hur-ry! Hur-ry!"

And then,

[Taichi]
"Arriiived!"

[Kiri]
"Haaah, haaah, zeeeh, zeeeh..."
//Haze? ...is it a translingual pun? Leaving it. -GHS

Kiri was worn out.
//But oh, running for an HOUR away from Taichi, oh, no problem! None whatsoever! This route is also said to take an hour. -GHS

[Miki]
"Oooh, nice timing!"

Miki was totally fine.
//What a sharp boy. Pun with Genki seemed way forced... -GHS
What an energetic girl.
//HACK ...but turns out it wasn't a pun, just a typo. A really really really inconvenient typo, given calculating/mercenary fits Miki perfectly (or at least, it should). -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's good we got here before it got dark, but we can't get home before it's dark, so..."
//Repeating Taichi repeats stuff? Maybe he's just tired. Or Tanaka's sloppy on editing, as he's been throughout this route. -GHS

Just in case, however, I got a big flashlight in my Taichi Bag as well.
//It's one of those, uhm, electric torches and stuff. Damn he carries around so much junk that this should be an adventure game. Maybe those WERE Zak McKracken and Leisure Suit Larry references... -GHS

[Miki]
"I wanted to see the sunset, so this is just right."
//This is as sepia as a non-flashback looks. The twilight being the loop, the blood, and the memories are all connected. -GHS
[Miki]
"And upsy daaaisy!"

And then, Miki drew towards herself the flowers she had in both hands (one of them me).
//Girly boy in one, boyish girl in the other. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

[Kiri]
"Kyahn!"

[Miki]
"It's the prettiest just before it totally sinks I thiiink!"
//The sun, the situation, Taichi... -GHS

Seems there'll be no more than thirty minutes to go.
//Should be right around six... of course. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...sigh, I'm huuungry..."

[Miki]
"Got anything edible, Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"I do!"

I took out the leftover Kanpan.

[Miki]
"That bag that looks like it's used by a boxer that's gone to the dogs, does it have everything in it or something?"
//Curiously, top result for that sentence is the description for Stanley Kubric's Killer's Kiss. Another 1950s film reference...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, because it's the Taichi Bag."
//Although the art in Cross Channel is certainly unreliable, this thing is never not once seen ever. -GHS

[Miki]
"My throat is a bit parched."

[Taichi]
"Here ya go."

Canteen.

[Miki]
"...a-, amazing."

She seemed to really want it.

[Taichi]
"Wanna eat a biscuit?"

These were made by Youko-chan.

[Miki]
"I will gladly! Here, Kiricchi."

[Kiri]
"Uh-, 'k..."

The two ate vigorously.

[Miki]
"These biscuits are... really delicious, aren't they!"

[Kiri]
"True... soft and sweet..."

[Taichi]
"Because they are Youko-chan's biscuits."
//That means it's her... uhm, I actually don't know. Maybe instead of silicone, the bra he's gotta have in his bag is staffed with biscuits??? -GHS

[Miki]
"You are really loved, wow!"

[Taichi]
"I'm just being favored."

The level of annoyance is higher than the level of thankfulness.

[Taichi]
"But I wish she stopped with the surveillance cameras at least."

...in my room.
//Meaning she doesn't just stalk him outside, and that she knows what he's doing at all times. -GHS
As the electricity has been cut I don't think she'll be able to employ them anymore, at least.
//NOT that same 'use' as typical. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so, what are you waiting for, Miki?"

[Miki]
"Twilight, was else?"
//"I heard the last movie was awesome (with the reminder that good and awesome are unrelated)!" -GHS

[Kiri]
"Isn't this the twilight?"
//No, seriously, she means it in the (echo) SYMBOLISM! (echo) way. IT IS THE TWILIGHT OF THE ROUTE, AND ALSO OF THE STORY OFMGFMVLSADZDSRP -GHS

[Taichi]
"What Miki's waiting for is the afterglow."
//Of sex? -GHS

[Kiri]
"Afterglow?"
//yokou<->Youko? -GHS

[Taichi]
"After the sun sinks, you know, when the sky turns that amazing shade of orange? It's the crepuscular light, in other words."

[Miki]
"We'll be looking at it, all three of us. Doesn't that feel so great?"

More than a date, this feels more like bonding between emotionally sensitive friends.

[Miki]
"MyeowMykimeowMeow♪ MyeowMykimeowMeow♪"

[Kiri]
"'ands OFF my boobs!"
//Sorta-lispy -GHS

Well, we're having fun so it's good.

[Taichi]
"...say, Kiri-chin with the sexual desire out of control."

[Kiri]
"PFHT!!!"

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha spit water."

[Kiri]
"Did she talk about it?! Did she show them to you?!"

[Miki]
"I showed nothing. It's alright, it's alright!"

I could imagine the general outline of what happened.

[Taichi]
"Remember that day, when you two first participated to club?"

[Kiri]
"...yes, let's say that."
[Kiri]
"Even if I wanted to forget that stuff it is impossible to."

[Miki]
"We weren't able to get in that readily, no."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm, not until the end of the exams, right. Because of aptitude."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

Joining up clubs wasn't left to volition.
//...except in CCC3003, the implication seems to be that at least Kiri was being told to make things work... so it's gotta be just in general, not specifically club. After all, Taichi can't be the only person she went around heel-kicking. -GHS
Wishes are conveyed, but...
For convenience of management, Gunjou was made into an elevator school with all but post-secondary education.
//This doesn't segue at all. Unfortunately, some parts of this still read like poorly expanded outlines. Uh, not that I don't know the feeling. -GHS
Kiri had come on Summer of last year,
Miki was not much later.
//Beach outing was first week of September 1997, Yutaka's death weekend of the second week. If Kiri came late May/June and Miki early July, the Club was together for like a month or two before falling apart at the absolute best. -GHS
The two of them were admitted as third years one school level below.
//Middle school. -GHS
The school building itself is the same, so even in those times there was some face-to-face.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Miki]
"That was so funny. Unforgettable!"

[Kiri]
"...was it funny now."

[Taichi]
"And you two even got a splendid nickname. From me!"

[Miki]
"Uhmmm, so Shima-senpai was Immoral, Taichi-senpai was the Aristocrat of Love, right?"
//Another awesome segue. -GHS

She remembers well.

[Miki]
"...'Aristocrat of Love' is the kind of thing that comes up frequently in your speech, Senpai."
//There are exactly ten references to that term in the whole of the script. Admittedly, this may be one of the several things that we are told but don't really see, like Misato's sleep-inducing high-gesticulation talks, Touko's ~deswa and the like. -GHS

[Kiri]
"And love slave, and love doll... disgusting!"
[Kiri]
"How about Disgusting Slave, should it not be that instead?"

[Taichi]
"Huuum... slave and furthermore disgusting, that's an awesomely low reputation I have, yes."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, the abusive languaaage!"
//Forget that, the LAME JOKES! Come on! -GHS

[Taichi]
"And then, do you remember that sermon Sakuraba did on seeds of persimmon?"
//Oh yes. Word used has explicit religious undertone. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...pffffffht?!"

Kiri spat.
Seems like she has the memories.

[Miki]
"On that topic, I have a question."
[Miki]
"Does Sakuraba-senpai have bad hearing?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, a damaged eardrum."
//The damage, of course, should've healed long ago and easily. -GHS

[Miki]
"Eh?!"

[Kiri]
"...I did not know."

[Taichi]
"I was the one who did that."
//A damage that should not exist, caused by Taichi. -GHS

Kiri's eyebrows knit.

[Kiri]
"Do not make this a joke."

[Taichi]
"Well, listen up. The blame lies with that guy."
[Taichi]
"...when I was in the middle school... hmmm, second year or thereabouts, there was a school festival."

[Miki]
"There isn't one now, then?"

[Taichi]
"We had all sorts of problems, that's why."
[Taichi]
"Back then things were quiiite a bit snug. The number of 'Experts' was really low, that's why."

* 'Expert' = person in which the basic emotions (happiness, fear, sorrow, pleasure) are present.
//See CCA0009B and more. Never established as Gunjou slang or used consistently, but the reactions below seem to hint at this. Expanded. Miki is described explicitly as an Expert. Curiously, the ruby text says it's "ushiki", but Youshikisha (reading of 有識者) is actually a world, while Ushiki[sha] doesn't seem to be. Could be "possibly intelligent/well informed person", making the term more sarcastic. Scare quotes to make the term scarier and terrifying. -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"So it's as you'd think, basically they wanted some approval from the residents around them. Even when the school is like this."
[Taichi]
"A school festival, well, because there's lots of guys who get unstable just at the bustle of footsteps of too many strangers, it was more like a play performed by volunteers."
//See CCC3004 for more. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That year... it was Shakespeare. The play was---"

[Kiri]
"Romeo and Juliet."
//And the pen name, possibly, was born. Hey, pass Rikaichan (names vocabulary) on Yamada Hajime's kanji name... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...correct."

Indeed.

[Miki]
"Waaay hackneyed."

[Taichi]
"Yep. It was exceedingly Neya."

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Miki]
"It's the anthropomorphization of 'hackneyed'..."
//BTW, speaking of constant anthropomorphization: a certain lion and a bunch of cheap paper cutters should be coming to mind to some. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ahhh, that's what it means..."

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh! Excellent follow-up Miki!"

[Miki]
"'s nothin'!"

[Taichi]
"I made up my mind. The only time I'll explain my own jokes by myself will be the time of my death."
//Maybe he'll tell us what this means on his deathbed? No, I suspect this means closer to "not even dead". -GHS

[Kiri]
"...that sounds like a line from some movie."
//If it is, it's not one I can find. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, anyway, Shakespeare. If I'd have to make the name in Japanese, let's see, kanji for shake read 'furu' and kanji for spear read 'yari', so..."
//Little point without kanji, so replacing with a really lame overexplaining. That's the entirety joke anyway. -GHS

Miki winced.

[Miki]
"...I can't feel the even tiniest intent of wanting to twist thiiings!"
//When you can't make a good joke, go meta I guess. -GHS

Yet one more victim of my honesty.

[Taichi]
"No-Twist Doctrine."
//That's less twisting the neck and more stretching the material. See CCD1001. -GHS

Just like a boxer that's gone to the dogs, I look up at the sky of madder red.
//Translating taught me that no matter how much UMADBRO, there's always a madder red. -GHS

[Kiri]
"But would that have even been spelled correctly?"
//Seems to refer to the (cut) part about Shakespeare's name in kanji... I think she's trying to make a tsukkomi, and damn she sucks. More curiously, ノーツイスト (and no-twist, eluding all the reference to the indie rock band The Notwist) seems to be more often found in reference to a type of clamp. ...is this a CLAMP reference? -GHS

[Miki]
"Who cares?"
//Usually it'd be a "dunno", but voice is obviously annoyed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let us now go guess the cast!"

[Miki]
"...Senpai was Romeo, I think?"
//Pretty close. -GHS

[Kiri]
"As for the rest... I dunno who was even there at that time..."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan was one year above me."
//Third year middle school, then. -GHS

[Miki]
"Then, Hasekura-senpai was Juliet!"

[Taichi]
"Better luck next time. It was the opposite."

[Miki]
"...a play with major twists?"
//Term also refers to a performance with lots of twists, so it ties to the above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed. Well, around then our builds were sort of the same, so however we did it it'd be OK."
//Cough, coughcoughcoughchooo chooo she rather handsome/we kinda looked the same/she was pretty/from New York City/I'm walkin' down that old fair lane/I'm in heat, I'm in love/But I just couldn't tell her so -GHS
[Taichi]
"And theeen, because there were no other people stable enough to do a play, all roles were performed by me and Youko-chan."
//Meaning Taichi had to do everything alone. Hey, just like he might be doing here... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Whoa..."

[Miki]
"And that... was a school festival?"
//More like a 学院嘆 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, that was for appearance's sake."
[Taichi]
"The play itself was a big success. Particularly the realistic kiss scene... that bitch... in front of people..."

[Kiri]
"Th-, this guy's crying..."

[Miki]
"What's the matter?"

[Taichi]
"Dammit all! At that time, I didn't even have my exhibitionist streak!!!"
//Odd/uncommon term, oddly enough(?). Perhaps this is the time when Youko "re-educates" him to social interaction (AKA "he plays a ton of RPGs and VNs"). That's possibly why he streaks in CCA0002 and CCC3004, and there's that CCD0022A to consider. -GHS

[Miki]
"And now you do...!"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, in our reciprocal kiss saliva was schlooping down in the gap between our two mouths."
[Taichi]
"Because I was in the role of the heroine, I was to try to escape kicking and fighting, but Miss Protagonist over there decided the scene should end in submission,"
[Taichi]
"and she went for an insistent underskirt genital touch, but not one person noticed. That is the magic of theater."
//See CCD0022A, again. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The play was a great success. I had to change my underwear."

[Kiri]
"...c'MON......"

[Taichi]
"And there we meet that new character, Sakuraba〜!"
//See CCC3025. While shinkyara<->shinkawa may not make much sense given the twist is revealed immediately, this one is a big hint. -GHS

[Miki]
"He appears!"
//Miki likely knows about Yutaka, too. How many times has she spied on Kiri being told that, anyway? -GHS

[Taichi]
"That idiot was a man loyal to his instincts. Well, he was a man extremely loyal to his instincts."
[Taichi]
"Sakuraba came to the play. And then he was immediately smitten."

[Kiri]
"With Hasekura-senpai..."

[Taichi]
"Nope, with me."
//He saw Taichi playing as a girl, and he was smitten with him/her. Right after Youko molested him. By rule of parallel, this strongly hints that Yutaka was also somehow smitten with him. Also, that Youko raped him. -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Both]
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEH!!!"
//You missed an E. I guess the っ glottal stop counts, then. -GHS
HACK shake screen -GHS

That nearly busted an eardrum.
//Get it? Because Sakuraba... -GHS

[Miki]
"Ehhh, ehhh, Sakuraba-senpai, with Taichi-senpaaai?!"

[Kiri]
"Hey, hey, you heard the rumor that Sakuraba-senpai has no interest in women whatsoever?"

[Miki]
"HYAAAA! I wondered about thaaat!"

[Kiri]
"Wah, waaaah!"

[Miki]
"Squeee, squeee!"

Oh shut it...

[Both]
"So, what happened next?"

[Taichi]
"Those harmonics kinda piss me off."
//see CCA0015, CCA0027, CCC0031B... it may be crap but it's a running gag. And having the PS2 and PC version running parallel means I just heard a quartet. Yay. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...bah, anyway. Sakuraba, in that, is stupidly Go-My-Way. He immediately showed up in the stage wings. He had up and picked some flowers that the headmaster planted in the flowerbed."
//グマイウェイ = go my way... グマイ gumai = stupid. Also, the headmaster must be strong. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I was shocked. From meeting to confession it was three seconds. Fast, and way too fast."
//Notice the lack of "he was a man so no". -GHS

The two held their breath.
...turns out I don't really want to talk about this.
//He's basically confessing to the same thing as happened to Yutaka. And he knows. No wonder. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What a misfortune it was that Youko-chan wasn't there."
//Provided she exists, he would've sent her faaar away at that point. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But I remained composed. I'm a man after all. I am found to be missing the physical hole to accept Sakuraba's love (adult joke)."
//It's the rare #2! (scatological joke). -GHS
[Taichi]
"Therefore, I exposed my symbol, providing evidence that I am a man. That is what is called 'symbolism'."
//I had to reread this three times during edit to realize this wasn't the kind of stupid gag line I sometimes add. Anyway, he whips out his dick when a man attempts to jump on him; talk about cross-conversation. Unless, of course, by "his dick" he means "his knife". -GHS

[Miki]
"...totally a lie."

[Kiri]
"Yeah, totally a lie."

[Miki]
"This joke's boring yannow."
//Between boring meta and SYMBOLISM!!! all we need is a guy with the glasses... well, we got a gal, so where do we find a comic book g-- Tomoki. Well, damn. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Yes, but let's bear with it. This story is very interesting."

[Taichi]
"...can I just cry?"
//But he doesn't deny it's a lie. So he probably did whip out a knife. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Regardless, Sakuraba did not stop."
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

              『A man is fine too!』
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"And with that the guy swooped on me. Truth is, I did have an idea about what hole I could use to receive the guy (adult joke)."
//The rare #3! So he sees Taichi as a girl, and decides to go down on him. And how the hell did someone who got raped and raped for so long not know that a dick can be stuck up his ass? Wasn't he the male partner for Yutaka's dad? -GHS

[Miki]
"UWOOOOOOOOH!"

[Kiri]
"Th-, that'd be..."

Having so much fun aren't you, dammit.

[Taichi]
"Then, to protect Our Chastity, I lunged at him with the palm of the hand. And I struck right on the ears... leaving him, well, with a bit of an injury it seems."
//...and Taichi retaliates violently, leaving him with the above (psychological) wound. And then Sakuraba pretty much relents and acts nicely, if pushily, around him. Very odd that the injury does seem to be caused by something a liiittle worse than the palm of his hand; like a large knife he *needs* to protect himself (see CCC4010). The comparison with Yutaka, here, is very interesting. How did Taichi genuinely expect Yutaka to die by just falling off the stairs? -GHS

[Miki]
"Ahhh, that's why his hearing got a bit..."

[Taichi]
"Later he came with his father and apologized. It was attempted rape after all. Well, my part in it was not questioned at least."
[Taichi]
"He'd been a guy who didn't listen to what people say from the start, and now he seems to have improved on that a bit."
//"He can now hear less due to his hearing problem" + "his character has improved and seems to listen a bit more now". Say without saying. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Then, Sakuraba was carried to the hospital... and there, that was all this ended up as."
//Including his problem. Did he find something in that hospital? Going by Kana: Little Sister I'd say he might. The thread that runs under Tanaka's writing is subtle but visible. -GHS
[Taichi]
"When I advanced to High School, there he was, all acclimated..."
//Sounds sort of odd. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Was he chasing after you?"
//The world's a stage -> Taichi on the stage (maybe Youko) -> Chosen by God goes and gets himself "fixed" by Taichi -> chases Taichi in order to help him with his mess. Well, he manages to clarify things for the readers, at least, but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Maybe..."

[Miki]
"And, what happened to you two afterwards?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing! That is to say, he didn't seem to be in the spirit to invade my full-width asterisk."

* Full-width asterisk = 『＊』 ← this
//Unfortunately it doesn't look that good with the font. Oh well. Sooo, when you think 'full-width asterisk' and 'curry bread', what comes to mind...? Also, if / is a flow and \ is a flow and they cross into an X, and there's a third flow, that becomes *. And so... -GHS

[Miki]
"Platonic lo..."
//Vs. ICHARABU KAWAII DESU ONIICHAAAAAA[error] -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't you dare."

I grab my head, at wits' end.

[Taichi]
"Honestly, I can't have any emotion for him except for mixed ones."
//Which is Taichi's hypocrisy. Yutaka and Sakuraba are to be read as not having done much that's different. One he ends up still resenting, the other just being half-heartedly friendly to (at least in his intentions). -GHS

[Miki]
"And that is the reason for all the bullying."

[Taichi]
"...what reaction should I have other than that."
[Taichi]
"Especially when that guy's abnormally kind to me if left alone."
//See CCD0002. And Yutaka again, but also Youko. Sakuraba's got a clue as to what's going on, but he's still not out of the valley. -GHS

I got goosebumps.

[Taichi]
"And then, on my own, there's so much I... well, better should I say, what I pursue are normal human relatiooons!, that's what I want to scream to the sunset at the time of my life I currently am at. There, all done. Was it interesting?"

Bob bob steady nod in duo.

[Miki]
"Innncredibly... interesting... that was."

[Taichi]
"...this story sent both Misato-senpai and Touko in a tizzy... females..."
//Try 'fujoshi'. -GHS

[Miki]
"Squee, squee!"

[Kiri]
"Squee, squee!"

Too late, the two were already deep inside their squee of a conversation.
With shrill voices.
I could do nothing but sigh.
And in the end, I told this to everyone in the club, dammit.

[Taichi]
"...look, Miki, while talking about this and that we're just about to see what you wanted to see now."

[Miki]
"Whe... ah!"

The sun had sank. Only its light, now, clambers up in the sky.
A shimmer like heat haze dyed the lower half of the sky.

[Miki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Wooow."

This is amazing, isn't it.
People are no more, but the world keeps on turning.

[Kiri]
"...whoooa."

It's overwhelming.
The three of us are enchanted by a spectacle for which we don't even have words.
Before long,

[Miki]
"...ahah."

A disarrayed voice, that is just like laughter---

[Miki]
"Ahah, hahahahahahah!"

She was crying.
//Or laughing, except, the emotions... it's complicated, but it's similar to Taichi. Who dislikes sunset, while Miki... well, since the sunset's the loop, and is likely not happening right now (who knows what time it truly is!), this may be also a regret about what she's doing. At the very least, she's not sure what she should feel at this point. -GHS
Our arms are pulled closer.

[Miki]
"Ahahahah, hYkh, ha-AH! ...ahaaah... uUh, uhnnnn..."
//Hmmm, see CCA0002 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Miki, what is it?"

[Miki]
"Beautiful... it's... beauti... WAAaaah..."

[Taichi]
"...Miki."

We had no understanding even the reason why Miki was crying,
we were just... concerned.

[Miki]
"It's so beautiful, beaut... hahah, hYk, hah......"

The afterimage of the afterglow vanished towards the horizon, a crying sob biding it farewell.

[Miki]
"BWAAAAAAH---"

All she did was convulse with sobs.
