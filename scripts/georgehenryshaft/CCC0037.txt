This gate to prevent escape somehow still left an impression of austere dignity.
Why is escape so strictly forbidden?
Because there is a possibility that people would be hurt.

Well, it's kind of a half-isolation facility.
Be at ease now, the dangerous people have been annihilated.
There are only eight people all throughout the world.
//These random assurances that there's no one out there sound less like desperation and more like foreknowledge. -GHS
And the general public had also been annihilated.
Therefore there shall be no victims.
Wahahah!

I pass through this gate open like a dead shellfish.
