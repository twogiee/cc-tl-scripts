At night, while writing the diary...

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

Sounds from the outside.
//HACK remove the candle. Doesn't look that good, tho. -GHS
I put out the candle,
and go to the window,
to look outside.
//HACK starry sky -GHS
Someone is walking in front of the house, in the street.
...Kiri.
//Her house is allll the way to the east side of town, and she's going allll the way to the countryside on the west side of town. There is absolutely no reason for her to do this... is there? -GHS
Holding a bag.
I guess I was starving for material for the diary, then.
//That's almost as obvious as the sex scene in Misato's route, really Tanaka... -GHS
My curiosity was piqued.
To the lower floor.
//HACK disarm changes above, remove useless waits -GHS
Far in the distance I can... see... Kiri's back.
//Nightvision "eyes", possibly, except in CCC3012a (next time he follows her) he won't have them active at this point. -GHS
I followed.
Before long we reach the outskirts, and Kiri laid down the bag.
I kill my presence as not to be seen, and close in.
A crossbow---
//See CCC0026, CCC3002. Why is he surprised? ...did Kiri have a crossbow in that scene at all? -GHS
It was absolutely not a toy.
Coming into possession of that in this country means to have a weapon of power without compare.
It is not capable of rapid fire, but,
it has its edge in quietness, and is rich in destructive power.
//NOT abundant? That would've been... weird I suppose. -GHS
Kiri pulls the trigger.
//Squeeze it, idiot. -GHS
A bolt pierced a withered old tree.
The sound of slashed air remains in the ears.
Kiri nocks a new bolt.
She completes the load via the crank cocking aid.
//See CCB0022 -GHS
Awkwardly.
But... I knew:
This is practice.
//NOT training, see CCB0018 -GHS
For combat.
Well then, who with?
Who with... indeed...
An icicle was thrust into my spinal column.

[Taichi]
"...!"

[Youko]
"Shhh."

Just on the arrowtip of being about to leap into a rash motion, I was pushed down on the shoulder with a miraculous timing.
//See CCC3003. Was he about to charge at Kiri... perhaps in the path of a bolt? Leaving 'arrowtip' sort of literal, given it all. -GHS
Thump, straight down.
Power was removed from the knees.
//He's literally swinging a pipe at readers' heads with this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...You..."
//ょ Yo ぅ u. Literal English "you", or first part of "Youko". This stuff is so suspicious. -GHS

[Youko]
"Quiet."

Taking a single deep breath, I regain my composure.
I talk to her in a low voice.

[Taichi]
"Why are you here?"

[Youko]
"Same as Taichi."
//Screaming it. Just damn screaming it. -GHS

She took notice of Kiri's behavior perhaps.

[Youko]
"Seems to do this every day."

[Taichi]
"...how did she even come into that thing?"

[Youko]
"Enthusiasts."
//We're meant to read it, like in CCB0022, that she found it in some weapon otaku's house... or are we? Her parents are almost never home, remember. If they owned it, they wouldn't spot it missing. And they would totally be allowed to own it; after all, Taichi and Misato are allowed to live without supervision 99% of their free time, and Youko can pretty much order up big foreign knives and have them delivered in this tiny town where the train is the only real access. It's a colossal governmental clusterfuck. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, that's likely."

If one has but money, it's comparatively easy to procure one.
//And given they're like cousins of the Shinkawas, it's not impossible they got money. -GHS
^??? it's there in the original script, commented out. Identical line to above. -GHS
After that, Kiri continued practice for a while.

[Youko]
"...want it removed?"

Sudden words.
They are absorbed into the still quietness in the intervals between the periodic sound of slashed air.
But inside my ears, they linger for a long time,
together with their horrifying meaning.
//HACK dim screen. Originally, it'd oddly reinsert the same BG that's already onscreen, causing a weird pause. -GHS

[Youko]
『Taichi... want it removed?』
//Her voice is shifted high really obviously, probably intended to sound much more childish. Matches the tone she'll have in CCC3025... but not CCC0000, maybe because of Mixed Memories, maybe because FFS just listen to this crap. -GHS
[Youko]
『I will remove it for you, yes.』
//This was in the original, though it was instant. What the hell were they doing here? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Remove, you say..."

[Youko]
"If you wish it, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"I don't wish it."

[Youko]
"But..."

I glare at her.

[Taichi]
"If you intend to do what I tell you to do, then you will do nothing."
//Specificity important, see CCE0001 -GHS

[Youko]
"...got it, yes."

She gives a somewhat discouraged drop of the shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan, even you are human... the same, human."
//...that he is. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"At least as far as you are together with me, half of you will be human."
//The rest will be... what? A devil? -GHS

[Youko]
"To me,"
[Youko]
"To me Taichi is someone I cannot think of as a person."
[Youko]
"Taichi is nothing more than Taichi. To me that is adequate. And I am also no more than I am. Two that make one."
[Youko]
"Halves."

[Taichi]
"...like fiancees, right?"

She smiles.

[Youko]
"Yes, fiancees."

That rare smile of hers is as cherubic as a little girl's, but,
why---
Before grief could paint over the heart, Kiri had moved.
//See CCB0015B. He's probably referring to him recalling her betrayal... and possibly even rushing out to meet death. -GHS
She recovered her exhausted supply of fired bolts,
and then fired them once again.
Three rounds later, Kiri has finished with practice.

[Youko]
"With that skill, as long as she is not aiming point-blank we'll be alright, I think."

[Taichi]
"But I don't want things to get to that point..."

Suddenly, I remembered about the hokora.

[Taichi]
"Say, Youko-chan, you know about the hokora?"

[Youko]
"...I know."

[Taichi]
"This world's---"

[Youko]
"Insufficient data."

She flatly cuts off my words.

[Youko]
"Wisdom is to not make rash conclusions."

[Taichi]
"But!"

[Youko]
"Even if, provisionally, we take that the world is made to repeat itself, there is no need to discuss it now, I think."

[Taichi]
"......"

She keeps silent.
If she says so, then it is likely so.
Hasekura Youko is always accurate.
//The word, as expectable, does not have 'correct' as its main meaning. -GHS
Kiri packed up and left.
There is no need to pursue more.
Coming out into the open space, I examine the timber that was turned target.
//平原, odd term. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

[Youko]
"...Taichi."

[Taichi]
"It's OK."
//Look at how small the pockmarks on this thing are compared to how HUGE the bolts are! There's no way this is all the damage! Of course, as usual, Graphics Can't Be Trusted... but if they could, then this'd reinforce the idea that she's using BBs. Because those would fit the holes. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It's OK..."
//HACK slower fade to black, ~ooominooous~ -GHS
