Walking on the road home.

[Taichi]
"Mmmh-hmm."

In the end, one whole day passed with nothing done.
//Will make more sense like this when it's 'pastad in CCC4005 -GHS
Perhaps, knowing that it will all be reset is to blame.
Somehow I just wasn't into things.
Besides... I might have gone to school, but I cannot feel its bustling liveliness.
The world had become almost entirely uninhabited.
With eight people one cannot call it a world.
A single eternal Summer...
We might just be the wreckage of mankind caught in the swirl of an eddy of time.
Or perhaps... it means something else.
//HINT HINT HINT HINT HINT HINT HINT HINT -GHS
Midway through a hill, I come to a halt.
On the side of the road there is a grove of trees.
//It's the one Nanaka forcefully "bumps" him into. Look below. -GHS
I remember.
I remember...
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
Shinkawa Yutaka was gazing lost at a grove of trees.
As I was drawing nearer to Shinkawa as he was, I called out to him.
//"as I came closer to him" + "as I was beginning to understand who he was". Shinkawa's remembering, by the way, and see below for how Taichi also does. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

Shinkawa was sweating.
On closer look, that's not the sweat of the heat of Summer.
He staggers back, unsteady.
//Towards the road. -GHS
A car came.

[Taichi]
"SHINKAWA!"
//Check out the auditory hallucination this comes with! -GHS

Shinkawa is struck, tumbles down and dies. That was the origin of my psychological trauma.
//轢 is almost always used for "run over by a car"... but it more literally mean "be knocked down with force, as with a vehicle". Which is what happened to Shinkawa: he was pushed down stairs by Taichi during the Mansion Massacre, which is also the origin of his trauma (see CCD5001, he uses the exact same word to describe that event so there's no doubt to what he's referring to). This sentence would be perfectly true... -GHS
...and all other things of that sort that didn't happen.
//...except for Shinkawa actually dying. With this denial, not a single lie was expressed in these last two sentences, and removing them would only subtract information from the story. Even though said information is pretty much impossible to see without extreme care. Oh well. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, it's the Tasaki Store's decorated company truck."
//Seems to mean it has a logo, but given below it's probably closer to some gaudy graffitied mess. As expectable of an ex-thug. -GHS

That hideously flashy thing passes us by at the leisurely speed of about thirty kilometers an hour.
//That'd still kill you if he doesn't brake. -GHS
That smiling guy waved a 'thank you for everythi〜ng' towards me and waved his hand.
//See CCA0004. Tanaka generally avoids having unvoiced characters have actual lines, although that'll become sorta awkward at times... like here. -GHS
Because I am quite the profitable customer.
//Should still have money now. -GHS
I returned the gesture.

[Taichi]
"Thank you for always stocking up on soft drinks for us Showa era fanatiiics!"
//360 edition: "I'm not gonna touch on them because of copyright, but..." -GHS

Am*sa
//This one was tough, but via the most sophisticated means of research known to mankind (chucking random katakana in the empty spot until something googles), I found it: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%90%E3%82%B5 -GHS

Inspector Pepper.
//~Useless Factoid time~ the word 胡椒医者 on which this pun is based is composed of 胡椒=pepper (as in vs. salt) + 医者=MD. And it does GIS to the actual Dr. Pepper drink. -GHS

//HACK doing my usual zomg leipu of the original material by putting these all on the same page (they don't appear in any console version). -GHS
Legendary soft drink-tachi.
//Intentionally silly. This is Taichi sidetracking into weird to avoid dealing with Shinkawa, whom he long recognized even if he hasn't realized it yet at this point. -GHS
He's a former railway otaku, so that's likely why he's equally fanatical about his business.
How exactly he manages to get them in stock I don't know.
//see CCC0009. Hmmm. -GHS
Anyway, Shinkawa hadn't died.
//Still no lies. -GHS
He was happy and lively.
//Focusing on happiness. That's what pisses him off about Shinkawa. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You've wandered into the boundary between life and death right then. If I hadn't gone and caught your arm, those gray brain cells of yours would've become a Guro Scene over the asphalt."
//I decline responsibility to anyone who decides to GIS グロ画像 with safe search off without knowing what's gonna come up. -GHS

Shinkawa was shaking.

[Taichi]
"Shinkawa?"

[Shinkawa]
"Ah... my bad."
//See CCA0011C. -GHS

He returns to his senses.
//He had gotten kidnapped by paramnesia as well, and had gotten in his own flashback, perhaps even his delusional world. He acts exactly like Taichi. -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"It's jus'... when I look like deep in the trees... I get this really bad feelin' and stuff... it's been like that since a long time ago... why, I totally dun'no tho..."
//See CCA0011C. That was 'zutto mae', this now is 昔 mukashi. It still means the same event, meaning that Taichi now is much further from those memories than he was back then. Time is passing whether he wants it or not. Maybe that's why these are sepia and those aren't... -GHS

He covers his face with his hand, as if puzzled by his own dizziness, for a time.
He then looked up at the blue sky, gasping as if pained.

[Taichi]
"......"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

[Shinkawa]
『Me, I can't really move one of my legs.』
//HACK return -GHS

I had thought he was External Damage.
//His Ultramarine -GHS
While in Gunjou they were a minority, there was a minimum quota of Persons Operating with External Impediments.
//Ugh, PC. -GHS
But could Yutaka have been Internal Damage... Operating with Internal Impediment. Maybe. In retrospect,
//Nickname vs. PC term -GHS
in the middle of the woods,
in a sealed space surrounded by trees,
//Specific term used for the Hasekura mansion and not just. -GHS
I would also have felt ill at ease.
//Contrast the hokora. While Nanaka zubaaans him into the trees, she leads him to the hokora. -GHS
A long time ago, there had been an event that had drilled a wound upon my heart.
And I could, therefore, manage to comprehend Shinkawa's feelings a little.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
