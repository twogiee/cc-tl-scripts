[Taichi]
"Y-, yessorta."
//HACK dolls continue from CCB2002 -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh!"

Even the very person who suggested it was surprised.

[Touko]
"It-, it's fine?"

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"I can't just starve you, Touko, can I?"

[Touko]
"That pause there..."

[Taichi]
"We can't get to the point where the Hankerin' Harakiri Hungry Wolf becomes possessed by the allure of food and is unleashed on the world."
//HACK out with the screen (so the scene makes sense at last!) -GHS

[Touko]
"......"

On guard.

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

No attack came.
//And that's it for the scene rebuilding, whew. Given the choice to reject Touko at this point was removed so last-minute that the scripts for it are still present, I wonder if that's the cause for this scene to have nearly all its dollwork unimplemented on release. -GHS

[Touko]
"Ah, uhm, I'm just going to bring back a change of clothes!"
//See CCA0010 -GHS

[Taichi]
"What?!"

[Touko]
"I'll come back right away!"

She ran off.

[Taichi]
"Matte! (Wait!)"
//Same as CCB2002. -GHS

I grabbed her ankle.
Smaaack!

[Touko]
"GlbGlbGlb..."
//Well, she sunk too. -GHS

Touko implemented a kiss with the ground.
//See CCA0002 -GHS
Good thing that we're on the lawn.

[Taichi]
"Good thing that we're on the lawn."

I directly contacted my true intentions.
//Should be ambiguous enough, see CCX0001. -GHS

[Touko]
"My nose... my pDecious nose Dat I Daise wif a cloDespin eBery day...!"
//Clogged nose. わらひ=ならい -GHS

So she has been doing that as well?

[Touko]
"WhaDD are you doing?!"

[Taichi]
"You really want to stay here?"

[Touko]
"I will be staying here! It's already decided!"

[Taichi]
"And you don't even show any shyness..."
[Taichi]
"You, you're always that unyielding spirit that punches people left and right, but in terms of artistic appreciation you're a heroine that finds an oddly convenient subservience in me!!!"
//See CCE0001 -GHS

[Touko]
"...I don't get what you're saying, no."

With a 'fwasah' I sweeped my bangs.

[Taichi]
"When you were so very admirable until moments ago!"
//I think it means he likes 'em tsun and not dere. -GHS

[Touko]
"Once I got your commitment, being all meek is not necessary anymore is it."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, AAAAAH, I was taken iiin!"

[Touko]
"Since there's no police anymore, I can carry my sword openly now."

[Taichi]
"!!!?!?"

The Demon Blade Harakiri, in my house!?

[Taichi]
"HYYYYYYH! SOMEBODYYY! There's a samurai girl with great skill in the handling of cutting implements heeeere!!!"

[Touko]
"There's no 'somebody' anymore."

Indeed there wasn't!

[Touko]
"Besides, thinking hard about it, this is no unwarranted privilege."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Touko]
"If you say I cannot, then give it back."

Shove.
One hand was thrust before me.

[Taichi]
"I've already returned 'My Neighbor Is An 18 Years Old Ecchi Imouto'..."
//HACK angry Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"I didn't lend you a porn video!"
[Touko]
"This is something more precious. Come on, give it back."

ShoShove.
Something much more precious.

[Taichi]
"I think I have returned 'Blooming Boardschool Bloomers'..."
//HACK ibid -GHS

[Touko]
"I didn't lend you a fetish video either!!!"
//HACK more suspicious Touko -GHS
[Touko]
"My most precious thing! The one you took from me by force!"
//Lying, of course. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh."

A very big nod.

[Taichi]
"What was that?"
[Taichi]
"Have you got dementia, you?!"
//HACK shy Touko -GHS

[Touko]
".........my virginity."

[Taichi]
"Sexual?"
//HACK Hankerin' Harakiri Wolf returns! -GHS
HACK independent CG shake -GHS

SMAAAACK!
//Nee "boom" due to the SFX, now of course changed. -GHS

[Touko]
"Reupholster your eardruuums!!!"
//Hence he has no ears that can hear. -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'yaaah!"

Explosion of Brute Courage.

[Touko]
"Anyway, I'll be staying! Recklessly staying! Diving into staying to granting you my staying... thoroughly staying! Already decided! Ratified!"
//sumuNUKU -GHS

[Taichi]
"How did you get a majority when you're only haaalf?!"

[Touko]
"So I'll be bringing over my luggage right quick!"

She spins back on a heel.

[Taichi]
"Wait, wait!"

[Touko]
"Something else now?"

[Taichi]
"...ermmm."

Is this unavoidable?

[Taichi]
"...it's just... getting consent with that line... yes, got it."

[Touko]
"You're all mumbling to yourself."

[Taichi]
"Okieh, I will recognize your immigration."
//Literal for reasons that should be obvious, otherwise u dont get CC lol kill yourself. -GHS
[Taichi]
"However, today's a bit of a problem. Isn't it better tomorrow?"
//Supposing that's what he was mumbling about above. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I gotta clean out the room at least, after all."

[Touko]
"R-, right..."

[Taichi]
"If we do this tomorrow, I can help you carry over the bags."

[Touko]
"Really?"

Touko smiles with the suddenness of a light bulb turned on.

[Taichi]
"...yah."

My poor work of art...
//See CCA0004C, but likely what's going on near the start of the script. -GHS

[Touko]
"Regardless, I must go home and prepare things."

[Taichi]
"So you do."

[Touko]
"Going home now."
//HACK to starry sky -GHS

With alacrity.

[Touko]
"See you tomorrow then. Since I'll be going to school as normal."

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

[Touko]
"You make sure to come!"

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

Touko grows smaller and smaller as she goes.
I kept constantly, loosely, slowly waving a hand.
//See CCA0011B -GHS
This has become awkward, didn't it...
//Actually problematic + problematic as in 'guest is staying over'. -GHS
