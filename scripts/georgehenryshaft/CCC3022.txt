All that aside, to club.
//See CCA0005A, CCA0030. This sentence may not be unrelated at all. -GHS
I drop in to the toilet.
Entering all natural in the girls' toilet.
I look at the mirror.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
My face is reflected.
White hair.
Pupils with a peculiar pattern.
If I wanted to call it something, an aquiline nose.
So I see, from my own eyes.
//See CCA0021. -GHS
Well-ordered, some people would say.
//See CCB2009. This is almost certainly intended as a comparison to Touko, given what's about to happen. -GHS
Girly features, they say.
//See CCC3016 -GHS
Well, that's probably how it is.
That is why I end up as 'that thing', yes.
//Supposing him being used as a doll. -GHS
I have a different opinion:
my face is somehow heterogeneous, making it eerie and terrifying.
//This is pure groundless self-conviction, however. As well as a pretext. -GHS
It looks like adipocere, and doesn't remind of a person.
...but a doll's.
A Hans Bellmer ball-jointed doll.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bellmer I especially suggest looking up some of his pictures, quite bizarre. The reality, however, is closer to Pinocchio as well as CS Lewis' statement about the world being a sculptor's studio. -GHS
There may be beauty there, but there's also a startling ghastliness... it contains the darkness of despair.
//Going with darkness both lateral and literal. Once more, see CCX0001: lateral darkness should be what he can see through. -GHS
No wonder then that I'm liked by fellow lovers of the dark.
//The Shinkawas, certainly, but likely Youko and the rest too. Different darkness kanji... -GHS
And I, myself, also crawl up and cuddle with that same dark.
//Still different kanji. -GHS
Except me... I like the normal.
What ethics has humanity tried to put together throughout its long history?
A bright wholesomeness with no darkness, maybe.
...is that not a mistake?
Doesn't the darkness just condense the more it is squeezed into a prison?
//This is a strong denunciation of his own pseudonihilism, whether he knows it or not. Notice the lack of trite whining about Light Needing Darkness To Be Seen. There's no Great Balance crap here; this is about the inevitable failure of pretending there is no darkness within the human being. -GHS
Things shall be born from this everlasting darkness.
//See CCA0021 -GHS
And in the end, can those be said to be people?
There's envy in that hair of people so very black. Unendurable envy.
//"I envy black hair" + "I AM DARKNESS AND MY HAIR IS JEALOUS!!!" -GHS
I did intend to dye,
//The implication is that he hasn't... -GHS
but hair growth is quick.
White invades from the hairline, all at once.
Whenever I look at that ashen that desires to be seen through the black hair, I realize:
this never goes beyond the ornament,
and that I am, right then, nothing more than something decorated.
//...and that he didn't. Regardless, notice the metaphor: he is white, but dyes himself black - and dislikes the white that still comes through to knock. He's not horrible, but wants to be... and largely because it's easier, see some of his rants in CCX0001 where he explicitly says he wants to be alone so he won't have to improve or admit his inadequacies, which are right around his major breakdown there. -GHS
A weird, eerie, uncanny face.
It made me nauseous.
Seeing things this way means there's self hatred to blame too, likely.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

Ahhh, this is a bad state of mind.
The matter of Touko is making me feel like I'm far too excessively good.
//Not because he's giddy, but because he's pining for her in the only way he knows of, really: self-bashing. This is the white peeking through. -GHS
I am so in love with decadence.
If I sink too far it'll be... really bad.
Sounds from a toilet stall.
//Not necessarily the sound of flushing, further implying there's no running water. That he's hearing, at least. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

Unhesitating, I quickly moved there.

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

Inside the stall was Kiri,
standing in mute amazement.
Face was pale.
Physical conditions don't seem favorable.
//Taichi is *seriously* worried about her. -GHS
I take position at the stall's entrance, blocking it with both hands.
//And there he is, inside the stall itself, blocking Kiri with one hand. How the hell do you manage to screw things up this bad??? -GHS
There'll be no escape this way, dear Kiri.

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

A flowing voice, as if a stranger's.
//He's talking as someone else, of course: as Youko. Whether she's a split personality or not. -GHS
The heart is rapidly calming down.
Serenity is being recovered.
//A load of bull. All he's doing is shutting down his brain and acting automatically. -GHS
Field of vision blunts.
The ability to evaluate the finer details vanishes.
//See CCC3004. Just rubbed in people's faces. -GHS
I'm certain that there's even a change in the pupillary.
Two eyes that shine in the pure darkness.
Because it's somewhat dark here, even Kiri must see that, no mistake.
//It's bright like the damn day... well, let's blame it on the artist. Again. -GHS
Flinch, Kiri's fingertips move.
Very sensitive responsive.
//This is the only thing he can see of her, can he? -GHS

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Kiri]
"Ah, uhm..."

There's abnormality in the air.
Kiri feels it too.
She's bewildered at how my words are so excessively calm.

[Kiri]
"...I don't... feel good..."

[Taichi]
"That's a problem."
[Taichi]
"You OK?"

[Kiri]
"...yes... uhm... I..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Kiri]
"...uhm... my things... the ending is hard..."

[Taichi]
"Ohhh. Is that what it was then."
[Taichi]
"I really didn't know!"

Frightened.
Glasswork,
//I'll keep all of these running for moar madness. -GHS
beautifully delicate,
innocence,

[Taichi]
"What kind of 'hard' you mean?"
//He's verifying that she feels bad because of something. See CCC0000. -GHS

[Kiri]
"A sense of insecurity throughout... the cycles aren't settled..."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, you are of that age now, therefore sometimes that happens."

beautiful lapis lazuli,

[Taichi]
"It's the immature balance of hormones as you're on the way to growing to adulthood to blame."

my Vidro,

[Taichi]
"Especially because your body figure is delicate, Kiri, so your growth to adulthood seems to lag behind."
//Just like Yusa's. -GHS

embrace and it will break,

[Kiri]
"...ah... so it is..."

don't embrace, and it will grow up dull, dark,
//Teh Madz only means he understands that Kiri is damn naive about the world, which is the source of her hypocrisy after all. -GHS
glass that will become but a clump of earth,

[Taichi]
"Yep yep."

its beauty will be... damaged,

[Kiri]
"It looks like it ended a while ago but... there is still blood... plenty..."

it will become normal. A normal female.
//This is not good thing, considering Tomoki and Sakuraba are "normal", which is what World Aphasic Miyuki looked like. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, therefore?"

The Kiri of this moment alone...

[Kiri]
"When that happens... I often become anemic..."

[Taichi]
"Ohhh. Then, there's residual blood..."

She has always been beautiful,
when she is distressed and when she is healthy too,

[Taichi]
"Even now?"

even now.

[Kiri]
"...hy..."

[Facial expression]
obvious fear.

A still darkness fills the stall.

[Taichi]
"Even now, painful?"
//oh yeah. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...what are you... doing...?"

The faint smile that I was making up until now vanished, suddenly.

[Taichi]
"...you will answer my question."
//He can't deviate from the Pattern. But the question, seeing CCD5001... did Youko have it as simple as seen in CCC0000, or was it closer to what is now? -GHS

[Kiri]
"No..."

Yearning,
yearning for... desiring contact.
Bit by bit the impetus rises.
There is something here that ought be called 'conflicted',
however, the opposition of rationality is less than papier mache.
At best it could be said to be the dissatisfaction with one's lot in life.
//See CCX0001. People who do this obtain only archery targets, which is why he's a pin cushion for Kiri. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Answer."

[Kiri]
"...go... away...!"

Why have I even left this fragile work of art untouched until now?
//Touko again. Also see CCB0006. That's very much the undercurrent, if it's not clear from how he keeps talking about her as 'glasswork'. That's what he likes of her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you answer I'll go."

[Kiri]
"......"
[Kiri]
"Even... now... yes."
//See CCC0000. -GHS

Because if it is touched thoughtlessly, I may just leave fingerprints.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, then,"
[Taichi]
"that's what's trickling down from the area between the legs, isn't it?
//See CCC0000 -GHS

[Kiri]
"...?!"

Kiri becomes astonished.
Did she not notice?
Her senses seem to be paralized by mental strain.
//See CCC3019A. Is it just Taichi that's imagining stuff? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...dark and thick blood, isn't it."

Dammit I looked at it.
The blood.
In this state of mind.
but,
I don't care.
//Blood isn't his trigger. -GHS
Kiri, I shall make you eternal.
A Milk Crown.
//OMFG GUILTY CROWN REFERENCE. -GHS
An instant of a shape created by a single drop.
//Just google the term. -GHS
Even more for the glasswork that is Kiri, that like it would pulverize in an instant. Appropriate.
//The time loop is the image of the Broadcast Club at moment of shattering. This may be read as nasty, but if it exists at that moment of shattering, then it won't vanish completely. People can't be still pictures, however, as he knows from Touko - and as he's restated just last script, seeing Touko being repeated is something horrible. Whether she's dead or just sitting day after day, week after week, in her classroom, refusing everything, until she's so debilitated she has to be cared for by a doctor. -GHS
Appropriate---

[Taichi]
"Dark and thick blood."

[Kiri]
"Ah, ahhh, no, nooo..."

I shorten the distance.

[Kiri]
"No, noNO... stay back, stay back...!"

Shaking like a kitten.
//See CCB0002 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Have you ever thought about how many kittens have died in agony on this Earth?"
//See CCA0023, more on that in a while -GHS

Touch on the thighs.
//I object to the use of the kanji 太 to describe Kiri's thighs. -GHS
Thin skin. Fingertips sink in it.
As if they could break through.
Squeeze and they would push inside the body.
//Toss a rock at it, nothing. -GHS

[Kiri]
"HYAAAah!"

Hair-raising horror and agony.
//See CCA0002, same term. -GHS
Voice straining.
Thin and high, trying to fly off the audible range.
//(Improbable) see Yusa's mom? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Five cats are born, one is adopted. Lives blessedly. Happy end!"
//He made himself holy, and therefore was Cat-holic. You think that's a bad joke, but at this point, would you really put Tanaka over this? See CCZDXC, maybe the mother was called Marie. See Jintai anime, Episode 2. Now take things a bit laterally including gender-swapping Kiri... -GHS

I let the fingertips slide. Towards the interior.

[Taichi]
"Two die of cold and starvation. Agonizingly. They might just have gone insane at the very end."

Touch on the blood.
Muddy, and gooey, just like semen.

[Taichi]
"One strolled off somewhere, and got eaten by a stray dog. He may not have suffered much, but who knows. Just, that the meaning of his life was to be a single day's meal for a stray dog with only a few years left."
//Five cats, plus the mother and dog = 7 -GHS
[Taichi]
"And from that, the dog may also have gotten the strength to devour the siblings and the mother cat. Truth is, that that hasn't happened is something I simply cannot say."
//The implication seems to be that the cat that was adopted and the two that died actually didn't end that way. That's not too odd considering that cats belong in boxes in Japanese culture (?), and therefore exist purely as superstates... even after being observed. Japan is weird. -GHS

I raise the fingertips,
and thrust them at Kiri.

[Kiri]
"...ah, ah, ah...!"

Breathing becomes shallow and rough.
Horribly sweaty,
pitifully so.

[Taichi]
"And the remaining cat, what happened to that?"

[Kiri]
"Hah, hah, hah...!"

Kiri's sight focuses tight on the fingertips.

[Taichi]
"...it got struck by a car and died!"
//See CCC3003, same kanji. Hmmm, is this the truth of the Hasekura Massacre? -GHS
[Taichi]
"Being a kitten, it got flattened in a second."
[Taichi]
"Agony there isn't, but meaning there isn't either."
[Taichi]
"Meaning there isn't either..."
[Taichi]
"What the hell is up with a death like that?!"
[Taichi]
"And how many times has this repeated, over and over up, until this moment?"
[Taichi]
"Open your mouth."

[Kiri]
"...aHfh."

Words aren't understood.
//Console version has an added line that implies it's his own words he can't understand, but this scene is too butchered to be sure that was always the intent. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Won't you please open your mouth."

[Kiri]
"Don't do... anything bad."

She says that with great difficulty.

[Taichi]
"If you open your mouth I won't do anything bad."
[Taichi]
"Come now, say ahhh."

Kiri obeyed.
I thrust in my fingers.
//"Blood like semen", see CCB2013. -GHS

[Kiri]
"NNNGH!"

[Taichi]
"...lick. C'mon... like that, nice girl aren't you."
//See CCC3012A. He's replaying that same scene. -GHS

I take out my fingers.

[Taichi]
"Society is agony, it's sorrow, it's full of those things..."
[Taichi]
"There is so much to be in anxiety about."
[Taichi]
"Therefore, the desire to connect. As quickly as possible, that to bear even the length of an hour is impossible."
//Yeah, well, he rhymed 'yaku' with 'nagaku', so he started it. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because if these connections are not made, you would lose the normality that is needed to live in this cruel world."
//Now he's lecturing her on why she should quit it with the overexplicit fire and brimstone pr--- the Ally of Justice thing. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But those people who are satisfied are totally blind you know."
[Taichi]
"I'm not afraid of loneliness!, they'll tell you. They'll talk to you with this smug self-satisfied face that just screams how incredibly skilled and self-reliant they think they are."
[Taichi]
"That lot's just garbage."
[Taichi]
"The heart and the mind to live normally are just put into their hands, so that they don't know true loneliness."
//MY EXISTENCE IS! DARKNESS!!! damn my white hair!!! It is crawling in the skin, such wounds don't seem to heal? ing -GHS
[Taichi]
"They are the people of a faraway world."
//This can't really mean the people outside of Gunjou... well, if people haven't gotten it when Tomoki and Sakuraba are technically non-Ultramarines. The people he speaks of may exist only in his emo mind. -GHS
[Taichi]
"They're different from people like us, humans who find growing their heart to be impossible."
[Taichi]
"They can stay in this distant world fine, but... wouldn't they come close, and they try to make prey of us, use us as food?"
//Now the "normal" people are the one who come in and try to break the "deviant" ones... then again, see Yutaka's death: no one cared. In fact, Kiri's parents were more relieved than Taichi, Yutaka's own victim. -GHS
[Taichi]
"You of all people should know this well, Kiri!"
//Because Taichi, but also how her friends etc. left her once they find out she's Not Normal according to the state. -GHS

So I say as my head comes closer.

[Kiri]
"...ah!, ah, ahhh..."

Fraying,
//Both (duh) -GHS
but I expect it to be temporary.

[Taichi]
"You've said it yourself. The world is frightening."
//See CCC3007 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Justice means the justice made for those people."
[Taichi]
"Good things left behind for our sake, not one."
[Taichi]
"But you still want to live don't you... well?"

Hard menstrual blooding,
//Should relate to the term she used to define her menses. LOL PS2 version at this point speaking of Taichi being "like a vampire", when it's avoided every single reference to Kiri's menstruation so far. -GHS
dark red.
I lay my lips on Kiri's thigh.
//See CCC3012A again. She's bleeding, so he's sucking it off. See CCC0000 again. -GHS
Tongue contacted.

[Kiri]
"...nNNOOOOOOOO!"

Lick it all up.
Lower limbs tremble, pitifully, so I embrace them with both arms.

[Kiri]
"Hy-, sob, hy-... uWAAAAAH...!"

Following along the leg, I reach their root.
Underwear were already a mess.
I stand.
Kiri looks at me.
Panic, and... a minuscule amount of animosity.
That is the preliminary preparation for the full-scale hatred.
Hatred's no problem, you know.
We can easily do this all over again.
Because whatever happens, our personal dignity will made to be no more along with everything else at the end of the week.
//I tried 'eigendignity', but then I woke up and my pillow was gone, and I'm still too puzzled at how things could get mixed in this way to use it. Anyway, this pisses him off sooo much. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

She inclines her upper body, pushing into the wall.
//Now see CCC3012B. -GHS
I lay my hands on Kiri's underwear,
//Compensation for services rendered. -GHS
tongue on the nape of the neck.

[Kiri]
"...a... animal...!"
//This is where that little purple nukige writing parody should be read as horrifying. -GHS

Words of abuse are like flirting.
I inserted my fingers from the sides of the underwear, and groped about the genital area.
//See CCC3019B, CCC3027. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...kill you..."
[Kiri]
"I will... kill you..."
//See CCB0008B -GHS
[Kiri]
"I will kill you, Senpai... for this."

[Taichi]
"Hah hah!"
//NOT same as CCA0002, but leaving it sorta-distinguished, see CCZAS. Eight is 八, which is nearly identical to katakana 'ha' ハ. -GHS

I expose her lower half, and put myself in close contact to it.
Kiri squeezed her eyes shut.
Something was thrown into the stall, making a dry sound.
I look.
Cans were flying in, spinning.
Two.
Two cans.
//HACK added in the console version. -GHS
They rebound off the wall, and fall to the ground.
//HACK changed in the console version. -GHS
An event that I saw in terrifying slow-motion.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
Consciousness accelerates at its utmost limits.
Cans do not fly. Somebody threw it.
//HACK splits as in the console version. This is too busy for a single screen after all. -GHS
Who? Unnecessary to think of that at present. Thrown. Intent. Thrown with an intent.
What aim? An effect is expected by the act of throwing the cans. Thrown cans will display an effect.
Explosion? Thrown ordinance? Hand grenade type. Confined space. Destructive power multiplier.
//HACK same, split -GHS
Death? Death. Death. Area attack. Evasion impossible. Position related. I will certainly die. I will die. Certainly.
//HACK back to normal -GHS
And Kiri?
Mouth open. Eyes closed.
//Proper way to reduce flashbang effect is mouth open (pressure), eyes closed (flash) and ears covered (blast sound). However, she's doing these two because of the above, she doesn't figure out it's a flashbang before Taichi does. Above was turned into question likely to avoid this confusion. -GHS
To pin down Kiri's ears I hugged her head.
//That would save her from the flashbang entirely. Well, except for the actual explosion which would bounce off the wall and tear them to shred even if it's a flashbang. -GHS
A tiny head.
Cute inn'she, Kiri.
One second felt like infinity.
In that infinite second, I felt great love for Kiri.
//No split in emotions. -GHS
And then the things exploded. Both simultaneously.
//YOU FOOL -GHS
The inside of the room was made white.
Thunderous roar. The pressure wave pushes on the back.
//should maybe add a tiger roar to the flashbangs sfx, I hear it is all the rage in hollywood -GHS

[Kiri]
"!!!?"

Kiri cowers in the middle of my chest.
This didn't end with mere cowering for me.
Eyes were burning.
//...but his eyes were closed, and he wasn't looking at the damn thing... -GHS
Hearing was dimmed.
Stiffness throughout the body.
Cannot move.
This is... death from explosion.
I learn of this sense of physical discomfort.
//Specific term. Kiri, being held tight, couldn't see or feel anything... even if the explosion should've killed them both. See CCC3012A, it was the same but less obvious there. -GHS
Sensations are being stripped away, each and every one.
So this is how helpless you become on being deprived of senses.
I can't even grasp the situation around me.
I was pulled by the nape of the neck.
//Well, he did NOT show a picture of the wife/GF/family waiting for him at home when he retires next week, so he couldn't have died. -GHS
I fall down onto my back.
Somebody is supporting me.
//支 -GHS
Ahhh...
What a nostalgic scent.
//Nanaka = 七>香< -GHS
It has never changed ever since that time.
Her... indistinct sweetness.

[Youko]
"..."

Hasekura Youko---
I am pulled out to the corridor.
//HACK fade instead. Wipe looks so weird... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah... what was that...?"

My tongue had barely gotten capable of functioning.
Body feels somewhat funny.
A feeling like a cramp or a spasm in the hands and the feet.
//HACK properly fade in the doll -GHS

[Youko]
"...flashbang."
//Even ignoring how the blast damage would've at the absolute very least seriously injured him regardless, he doesn't have two very burst, very bleeding eardrums from that point-blank explosion. He certainly wouldn't have recovered hearing in less than a minute! -GHS

[taichi]
"Flash... a bomb?"

[Youko]
"Known as a stun grenade. A hand grenade that emits a particular flash of light."

[Taichi]
"Ah."

I see.
I was thinking I had seen that thing somewhere.

[Taichi]
"...that was... from that time."

[Youko]
"Yes."
//But she never killed anyone there! Did she toss flashbangs back then? Nothing is ever seen in the new CCD0022A. And was it still to stop Taichi? And why would Taichi have forgotten what they're like? Then again, this could just be a reference to CCD1001, when Misato bought off Taichi with two cans of juice... -GHS

She made an adorable smile.
Reminiscing with her is always like this.

[Youko]
"And, I used two as service..."

[Taichi]
"Meaning incomprehensible... way so."
//Maybe it's just to stress the absurdity of him surviving a close-quarters flashbang blast in confined space. One's beyond credibility, two? Not happening, bub. -GHS

[Youko]
"Rationality... returned yet?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah... I'm alright."
//See CCA0011C. Heiki, heiki. -GHS

[Youko]
"My apologies... that was violent behavior."
//Both's. ...wait, "both's"...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"No problem."

An unavoidable measure, likely.

[Taichi]
"But, how come you went all the way to stop me?"

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I wasn't really in an emergency or something..."

That is when I realized:
no, this is not about rescuing me from emergency at all.
This was about me wanting to be connected with Kiri.
And furthermore... as the most pure myself.
Jealousy.
It's jealousy and no more.
My feelings wilt.

[Taichi]
"Why are you trying to... degrade yourself?"

[Youko]
"...but."

[Taichi]
"'But', again?"
//See CCC3003 -GHS
[Taichi]
"When you're capable of living on your own, damn you!"
//See above. Taichi doesn't get her... and not just her. -GHS
[Taichi]
"When you don't have any need for something like me!"

[Youko]
"...do need!"
[Youko]
"I cannot live with one half alone."

[Taichi]
"I'm not half of anything!"

[Youko]
"...Taichi."

There is no logical reply, just, my head was hugged tight.
//See CCB0002 -GHS
I am kissed,
with refined manners.
Resistance... I hadn't any.
//See CCC0000. Might's well CP the entire script. -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi, can you stand?"
//Hmmm... nah, leaving it like this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah..."

All five senses had more or less recovered.

[Taichi]
"My uniform got covered in dust."

[Youko]
"...I smelled some sweat."
//So did he smell her. Which is continuously absurd: flashbangs, as explosives, shouldn't be odorless. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I do wear this every day."

[Youko]
"......"

Expressionless disgust.

[Taichi]
"Eh, ain't that normal?"

[Youko]
"...pigpen."
//It's just a kiddy word for 'dirty', but there's nothing quite equivalent. This half-reminder of CCA0009, half-Peanuts reference should do. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Welll, then it's fine if we stay apart!"

[Youko]
"......"

Expressionless saddening.

[Taichi]
"And anyway, doesn't Touko wear the same clothes every day now?"
//And his first thought remains to Touko. -GHS

[Youko]
"But 'that' owns a number of identical clothes..."
//Jelly jelly. See CCB2002 for just how much (looots) -GHS

[Taichi]
"WHAAAT?"
//HACK actually display the doll -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ngh..."

Kiri came out, staggering on her feet.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu... Taichi."

A look in her eyes as if seeing an enemy.
//Layin' it on thick ain't we. -GHS
...obviously.

[Kiri]
"How dare you...!"
[Kiri]
"How dare you, how dare you!"
//Contrast "yoku iu". -GHS

Those were not tears of sorrow.
This was an emotion that only those who have been persecuted, dispossessed and toyed with can feel.
...pure unadulterated wrath.
That was righteous indignation.

[Kiri]
"I knew it... you... you people are..."
//This is the absolute only time she demonstrates she even sees anyone but Taichi. And the "you people" can refer to people like Taichi in general, since she's firing into Righteous Indignation and therefore against the world in general... -GHS
[Kiri]
"Insane!"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"..."

Youko-chan took out an edged weapon.
A very big knife.
Kiri's face turned white.
//No change in doll in any version. Either Taichi does it, or nothing happens at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come now."

[Youko]
"...she is a prisoner of hatred, she is something dangerous to Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Going to break your promise?"

[Youko]
"But."

[Kiri]
"Why even at this point."

She wedges in.
//Between the two of them? Totally ignoring their conversation as well? I don't think so. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...whatever happens... as long as I live, will I not just be made into food for you!"
//Not "you two". -GHS

[Taichi]
"I have no I idea how I could possibly explain this, but..."
[Taichi]
"Sorry!"

A quality of apology on par with a cheering squad, if I may boast.
//HACK sweatdrop Kiri. -GHS
Kiri went slackjawed for one instant. But, soon, that warped into humiliation.

[Kiri]
"...I can't... comprehend."
//See CCA0023, once more. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Just what was that... what, just what are you?"
//...not "what are you two"... -GHS
[Kiri]
"I cannot understand, I just CANNOT understand!"
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS
[Kiri]
"...but... I do not care anymore..."
//HACK new SFX -GHS

Holding down the disheveled pit of her stomach, she walks away.

[Taichi]
"C'mon, wait up!"

Killer silence.
//Visuals -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi... got completely absorbed in that."
//Likely in love. -GHS

As I go to follow her, I am called from behind.
//HACK interesting how the two aren't onscreen at the same time here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Not a problem, is it? This'll all be done over again anyway."
[Taichi]
"My eigentime is completely meaningless."
[Taichi]
"And for the sake of increasing the amount of information in the diaries, I ought do all kind of things."
//HACK since the doll was already loaded anyway. -GHS

[Youko]
"If this happened just because of that certainly... but Taichi is wrong here."
[Youko]
"Taichi is treating a broken toy with far too much care."

[Taichi]
"You say I should be living opposite of you alone, until death?"
//Opposite as in face to face... or as in opposed, ambiguous. See CCC3030, which clarifies this somewhat. -GHS

[Youko]
"Yes, like that time."

[Taichi]
"...never making connections with anybody else."
[Taichi]
"Inside a tiny circle of friends, forever..."
//Extremely ambiguous too. It's likely about cutting off oneself from others emotionally, not simply away from the rest. -GHS

[Youko]
"Size is subjective."
[Youko]
"Living within a family of a hundred people and living with me alone are things of no great difference."
//Because Solitude Even If Around People. But if taken literally, his life alone with a possible hallucination of his warped personality and his life with a lot of people in the Mansion was very much the same. -GHS
[Youko]
"In Taichi's evaluation criteria there's too much attention paid to the ordinary, I think."
//See CCA0017A. -GHS
[Youko]
"But what the self needs is something that comes from the analysis of the self."
//No rules, no external impositions... nihilism. A monster of rationality. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...what's wrong with the normal now."

[Youko]
"It is unsuitable for Taichi."
[Youko]
"For those girls cannot possibly become more than temporary playthings."
[Youko]
"...it won't last. It will end soon."
[Youko]
"Taichi himself will want to make it all end."

[Taichi]
"......"

That may be so.
Just like it was long ago.
I understand what she wants to say.
However.

[Taichi]
"Let me do whatever I like this week."

[Youko]
"...indeed."

[Taichi]
"You should just go home for the day."

[Youko]
"Don't just push me away so much..."

[Taichi]
"I'm saying you don't need to watch over me. Because, even if there was some danger, tomorrow's Sunday. Ain't that the day of the clean slate? If I do something stupid it won't be that much of a problem, right?"

[Youko]
"...eigentime."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Youko]
"You, as you are now, live in eigentime and I, myself, am living in eigentime."
//"I as I am now" will be more important later. -GHS
[Youko]
"Who you are now only forms a pair with me as I am now. That's obvious, however..."
[Youko]
"The desire of my eigenself is... going to be different next week."
//Starting after this reset she'll put a chastity belt on Taichi. The problem, of course, is that if these characters are fixed (see CCC0045A), how are their eigenselves different? More importantly, see CCC4022. Youko had no care for eigentime, says Miki. I suspect that, much like the change in CCC3030, this is an intentional contradiction. -GHS
[Youko]
"Therefore, well..."

As if pleading.

[Youko]
"Every week we are destroyed."
[Youko]
"Our proprietary is destroyed. In other words,"
[Youko]
"it means that every week we are different people..."

[Taichi]
"...!"

The same thought as I.
//WONDERING OUT LOUD WHY IN CAPS LOCK. -GHS

[Youko]
"What the myselves that live in other weeks will do is something that I do not know, however..."
//This sounds, however, like she isn't unreset now... not that it ever mattered, whether she exists or not. -GHS

Tears.

[Youko]
"Within all of these many possibilities, does one where Taichi treats me kindly... even exist?"
//Conflicting goals: he wants the harem ending, she wants Taichi ending. Neither's happening, and for the same reason. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That... I don't know."

[Youko]
"In the notebooks there was no pattern like that."
[Youko]
"...there is only vanishing in the mists without obtaining what was desired."
//Kiri. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's have this chat later."
//Translation: "you're annoying me, piss off". -GHS

[Youko]
"There's no later."
[Youko]
"I will just vanish, still incomplete."
[Youko]
"This will become... farewell."
//See endings of Sendback. She still views the world as purely materialistic. She wants what she wants, and she wants it forever, and here. No pattern like that exists in the history of the world. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...indeed."

[Youko]
"Apologies... I will not intrude anymore."
//HACK out with the doll. -GHS

She turns away.

[Youko]
"But... please record this much:"

She speaks from her back.

[Youko]
"...wherever you go... a person that will understand you... you will never find."
//Hence God. That simple! -GHS

Words that are heavy as stones, that drop straight down to the stomach.

[Taichi]
"............"
//Not needed here. -GHS

I watched until the image of her walking down the corridor turned the size of an ant and vanished.
//1) she lets him do that, since she can Kill Her Presence 2) HOW ****ING LONG IS THIS CORRIDOR??? -GHS
I don't hate her, I really don't.
However... in her wish there are too many contradictions.
The lines of these two people seemed like they would never know mixing.
//Vs. crossing -GHS
