[Sakuraba]
"Yo."
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed him a surgical mask.
//Apparently this is taken from the Sendback script. Then again, Sakuraba has vagabondism, so his sendback route is spread all over the script. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"O.K."
//Another of those OMFG HARD KANJI'S that are so hard to adEpt -GHS

He put it on, not one doubt or question.
//Contrast Youko. His nonreaction is very different from a complete capitulation; Sakuraba doesn't necessarily understand immediately, or at all, he simply trusts instincts that will reveal themselves to be superior. iow he's zomgflolsbbq piloted by jesus lol -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hungry."

[Taichi]
"Haven't eaten then?"

[Sakuraba]
"Readying for first period class."
//HACK music was missing for some reason, replicating CCA0025. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...is the subject curry bread perhaps?"

[Sakuraba]
"Until that day when curry bread itself has finally passed."

Cooly resolved.
//Given there's a new sentence below, supposing this is intentional. -GHS
Just as in the records.

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't you like to eat some retort pouch curry too?"

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."

Just as recorded.
They're becoming real one after the other.

[Sakuraba]
"Heh-cks!"
//HACK independent doll shake (no vanishing this time) -GHS

[Taichi]
"...the Tragedy of the Hexagons."
//Every one is a heart. -GHS

This was also in the records.
Rate of occurrence up to present has been just confirmed to be 15% or more.
//...which makes it exactly 16%, right? -GHS
My calculations say that once in seven times I will be struck with a Nasal Discharge Bridge.
//...nope! That would make it 14.3%, which can't be approximated to 15 or more. Let's assume this 'seven' is rounded up. Let's keep it simple and say it's once in 6.6 times, which is as low as you can go to still reasonably approximate to seven (or as low as it's practical for these conjectures at least): this makes the ratio 15.15%, which is within parameters. The apparent errors - 16% (1+6=7), 14.3% (~2x7) - are possibly intentional. -GHS
However, a celebrated personage of the past (me) has worked out an appropriate avoidance technique via installation of a mask.
//It's probably just "I was Hexed by Sakuraba today. Next me, use a surgical mask or something", and nothing particularly suspicious. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...is it OK if I take off the mask?"

[Taichi]
"That cannot be allowed."
//And now, compare Taichi with the gas mask. More importantly, if this is what Yusa used to form a connection, what he's doing may look superficially like it'd save him some embarrassment, but it also cuts off a connection with him. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"So harsh... this human life."

[Taichi]
"That's what I'd like to say!"
//HACK stop music -GHS
