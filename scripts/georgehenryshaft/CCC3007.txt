[Shinkawa]
"Truth is, I got some memories missing."
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
Odd emphasis on what should normally read "memory loss". Interesting that he goes into what is almost certainly narcolepsy, and the first character that comes out is Yutaka, who does have narcolepsy. -GHS

Out of the blue the guy said that.

[Taichi]
"Like a main character innit."
//Ah, but our protagonist has perfect recollection. Just watch how he consciously remembers who Shinkawa is! -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Nothing, nothing. Just forget it."

Shinkawa spoke.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
He has no memories of the time he was a boy,
he has a phobia of things with pointed ends,
//Trypanophobia is a rare/uncommon term, common would be fear of needles. However... the term 先端 is often used for the dickhead in sex scenes. Compare Sakuraba's impotence, and there you go: this has nothing to do with needles, and it's purely sexual. -GHS
and the darkness of the woods makes him feel
a morbid fear.
//but I thought Morbid Manor was a level in-GHS
Something had happened. A long time ago.
//See CCC3003 -GHS
But what, exactly, he doesn't know.
Kiri's parents didn't seem to want to tell him.
And then, Shinkawa Yutaka spoke of how he is
without family.
//This adaptation wouldn't be needed if the first sentence flowed with the rest... curse this NVL segment for5seconds! -GHS
All is in darkness.
//But Taichi can see through it. -GHS
And then, in the end, he was sent to Gunjou
together with Kiri.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"...munch, munch."
//This reminds me, he actually IS saying "munch munch", these are not SFX. The Japanese don't eat with SFX; they actually do say 'mugu mugu'. I either read it on Wikipedia or was told by the guy in the padded cell next to mine, so you know it's reliable. -GHS

I listened to all that while greedily devouring a pizza.
//His dontgiveashit level is in the upper reaches of 99%. This is very intentional. -GHS
It was a delivery pizza.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
Those days I was uncommonly affluent, therefore I had lunch delivered.
//Part 6, Taichi the Failed Speculator -GHS
Basically, with the pretext of healing the heart, Gunjou's school regulations are next to ignorable.
If I was prevented from having my pizza, I might just become emotionally unstable.
//So if he were to wear a girl's uniform and a wig and occasionally pretend to be a year older and in Misato's class, who'd stop him? -GHS
The mere possession of self-awareness made a lawless space of this school designed to isolate people with the pretext of medical treatment.
//See CCA0021, CCA0007. Besides the meta (hi, trolled ones!), it's Gunjou that allows him to stay like this. I think the effect Tanaka's going with this concept of 'self-awareness' is that (sadly demonstrated) idea that the handlers of a nuthouse can't tell the insane ones from normal ones that were to be put in there by mistake. It's true because I'm totally sane and I was put in here by mistake so GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW DAMN GUAAAAAAARDJDSPGWE-GHS
...it's like an island prison.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, that's how it is. Memories missing. Hmmm."
//Sounds a bit like he's ridiculing him. Of course. He remembers. -GHS

I gave it deep consideration. And then,

[Taichi]
"Okieh!"
//Ibidem -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"Right... well I thought, you know..."

[Taichi]
"I'll be positive on Shinkawa who has memories missing. But Shinkawa without memory loss is too unpleasant to accept."
//"I'll forgive you if you have memory loss, but if you don't, I won't". He may actually be consciously remembering at this point. He's lying to himself, however, see CCC3026, or rather, he's stating what he should do but won't, see CCC3030. Rules followed in the outwards, not in the depth, like Misato does, and as is his wont as a fallen human. Also, "I go well with Shinkawa with memory loss, but I don't with the one without memory loss". -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"......"

And in that listless space came Kiri.

[Kiri]
"You two mate-ing again."
//So odd she'd use that term. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh, Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"...please do not call me 'Kiri-chin'."

[Taichi]
"But you're Kiri-chin ain'tcha."
//切り賃? -GHS

[Kiri]
"Just Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Kiri then."

[Kiri]
"Please do not call me without honorific!"

[Taichi]
"Make up your mind!"
[Taichi]
"Right, Yutaka?"

[Shinkawa]
"............"

He fell asleep.
//So damn meta. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Quick to sleep this guy."
//ONIIIIIIIIII-CHAAAAAAN WAKE UP -GHS

[Kiri]
"...he has been like this since a long time ago."
//That "long time ago" again, see CCC3003. -GHS
[Kiri]
"They seem to be something like after effects..."
//ITS YOUR FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL AT NEKO ACADEMY -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, like how he has memory loss, then."

[Kiri]
"...did Yutaka tell you?"

[Taichi]
"Just now."

[Kiri]
"So he did... that means you are trusted then."

[Taichi]
"Wha-?"

[Kiri]
"Because, at our previous school we did not have friends. Neither I nor Ani."

That happened frequently,
//ONIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIi-CHAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAaAN -GHS
especially since the results of the Conformity Test were frequently leaked.
//Your Tax Dollars At Work. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Even the people who were friends betrayed us... we could no longer trust anyone..."
//See CCB0023. So easy to manipulate. -GHS
[Kiri]
"We did not hurt anyone, but still everybody hurt us."

[Taichi]
"And then you went and bared your fangs."
//Referring to CCC3004 -GHS

[Kiri]
"If you are attacked, is it not natural you would protect yourself?"
//Necessarily referring to him, see below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That is one way of thinking, yes."
[Taichi]
"But in this world, it's ordinary for wild beasts that defend themselves to be shot to death."
//Kiri's crossbow is a hunting weapon as well. Hypocrite much? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...are you not human?"
//Careful now: different from his usual taunt, "you are not a person". She wondering why he would even consider not defending himself from someone who'd shoot him to death. Interesting foreshadowing, on this. -GHS

So spat out Kiri, tone lowering.
Righteous indignation.
Kiri was far too straightforward to live in modern times.

[Taichi]
"Inside here... truly, there's something not of the person."
//THIS is where her "you're not a person" will come from. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Every once in a while, when you think about the people around you, don't you find yourself thinking they are sort of, like, irrelevant?"
//Thinking others irrelevant is not necessarily about thinking them worthless; it's about not thinking them as worth paying attention to, see CCB2006. It's more hinting that Taichi's simply pretending no one is there. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I do, at times. At times, mind you. But... if I became completely like that, I'd be done for."
//Completeness, see below. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I just do my best to live. I wag my tail a bit to those people that call themselves normal, launch myself into flattery a bit to them... I gotta live."

[Kiri]
"Is that why you act so weird?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno... never really gave it much thought."
[Taichi]
"...you're also like that."
//HACK flustered Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh... me... as well?"

[Taichi]
"You wanna live, don't you."

[Kiri]
"I..."
[Kiri]
"I...!"
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS

She lowers her face. And hugs herself.
//HACK normal Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"The world is unbearably frightening, yes."

[Taichi]
"What part of it?"

[Kiri]
"...the malice."
[Kiri]
"Everybody's malicious..."
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS
[Kiri]
"No one... no kindness... not a shred of kindness..."
//"わたし、それだけでじゅうぶん。とっても優しくしてもらってるよ……" -GHS

She's shaking.
Yes.
She, herself, is not here because she has wished it.
She was given no choice but to come here.
The country has so decreed,
and opposition is not tolerated.

[Kiri]
"...I think that humans, when they depart, will just vanish like that... because in this world there is nearly nothing."
//Their death, their total disappeareance... the end of the world. This is part of how Taichi's Settei will be constructed. -GHS
[Kiri]
"I am sure, there is Nothing in so much. In just so little is there Anything!"
//People, places, everything. -GHS
[Kiri]
"And we won't know when we will be washed away... I think."
//Perfectly predicted... but is it a prediction, or a self-fulfilling prophecy? The idea of the Big Wave continues the idea of the present day being allegorical for post-flood Earth, the lack of timeline is consistent with Matthew 24:38-39. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sort of... an SF-like thing, the Fall of Mankind?"
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"It is different from that... it is different in how there is a reason in that..."
//HACK flustered Kiri -GHS
[Kiri]
"This will be like waking up from a dream."
//This might as well be a direct quote from C.S. Lewis. More importantly, Taichi does a lot of dreaming... like right now. -GHS
[Kiri]
"If all is quarreling, then everything is scary..."
[Kiri]
"But one day, all of a sudden everything will be no more... and I keep thinking, what if I was the only one that will be left behind... in that tiny worthless world..."
//Bah, don'tcha worry. That stuff's apocryphal. That's why Tanaka's a clever clever troll: those who don't look will think it some unexplained irrelevant sci-fi thing; those who look will think it Rapture, as humanity apparently up and vanishes; only those who look close enough will recognize it's the Great Flood except with Denpa instead of the actual waves. There's no being Left Behind after the Rapture here; there's no Rapture at all, as this is strictly pre-Apocalypse. -GHS
[Kiri]
"I... I'd..."

[Taichi]
"Sakura Kiri."

I call her back.
Color sprung quickly in that face that had sunk into depression.

[Kiri]
"Ah... apologies..."

[Taichi]
"Afraid of people's malice, and afraid of being alone as well... then."
//HACK flustered Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"Sit down, have some pizza too."
[Taichi]
"One of the food expenses here's asleep."
//Can't source 食うブチ as anything but 食いぶち, "a worker's pay". Likely a multiple entendre of the sort that Taichi's used for Yutaka so far, but I don't quite get the pun if so. See CCD0023. Going with Shinkawa being part of the food expense (i.e. a mouth to feed). -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"......"
//HACK normal Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...huh."

She slowly sits down. She does not lay hand on the pizza.
//Japanese pizza, *shudder* -GHS
It's emotional swingback.
She was just a bit out of it.

[Taichi]
"And to top it all of, you were sent to the penal colony."
//On the moon of Rura Penthe? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so is this a penal colony, then?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed it is."
[Taichi]
"But there's no malice. Bullying neither. Look around!"

I point around us.
Noon. Lunchtime.
Those who could eat by their own strength were eating, bit by bit.
//The rest are oddly unmentioned... -GHS
There are no gatherings, and every person is eating by themselves.
Conversations neither.
The chat between me and Shinkawa had been about the only one.

[Taichi]
"Everyone's passing time in tranquility."
[Taichi]
"In a sense, they have the strength to live alone."
[Taichi]
"With no necessity to form connection with people, they become complete on their own."
[Taichi]
"Mankind perfected."

[Kiri]
"But that is... weird."

[Taichi]
"When people become connected despite being inexperienced, discordances occur."
//Literally "shelves of 'insert' kanji topped by a stop kanji, plus Abe Lincoln's Hat or five mouths". Kanjis are weird. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And those frequently occur between normal people as well, don't they."
//See CCC0041 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Therefore, if people become perfect, they ought be satisfied with solitude."
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Not eating?"

[Kiri]
"Ah... eating things that other people have touched, I just cannot..."

[Taichi]
"Mysophobia, isn't it."

[Kiri]
"...by males, especially..."

[Taichi]
"You've also androphobia?"
//HACK is that a lifted eyebrow??? I can barely see the difference... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, not that, not really... it's just that somehow... males are... unclean, that's all."

[Taichi]
"Don't you be talking crazy now."

It's something a girl in puberty is liable to have, perhaps, merely an awareness of the opposite gender.
It easily becomes hostility, and generates withering in times of peace.

[Kiri]
"......" (fidget, fidget)

...like now.
Or rather, to view it in another way, this is an overflowing curiosity about things sexual.
Weeee.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, I'm happy and I shouldn't be..."

It would be improper to forcibly steal Yutaka's future wife.
//HACK normal Kiri. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Uhm, but, about what we were talking about before..."
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS
[Kiri]
"Maybe there is no malice, but... somehow I feel that the parts with Nothing here are vast... even if you get close and talk to someone, they don't reply."

[Taichi]
"Well now, it's not like they're really ignoring you. The laws are just different."
//HACK normal Kiri. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...laws?"

A repetition mixed with a question gives her a look of youth appropriate to her age.
//metal gear??? Either that or Tanaka's calling people who write like that as writing as/for children. If so I can't disagree. -GHS
This, I realized, was the real Kiri:
this hesitant young tongue-tied girl that is shy around strangers.

[Taichi]
"I could say the Channel is different... or should I say there is no way to make yourselves Cross..."
//Oh, but look at this, gentle reader, Tanaka's blatant about the stuff; there's nooothing hidden aaanywhere at aaall. -GHS

I can't really explain it well.
//I can: SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"'Cause you and me, Kiri-chin, our base mental condition is normal. Those whose base is not normal got different standards."
[Taichi]
"If you contact the other party while conforming to their rules, you can construct conversations."
//HACK lifted eyebrow Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...how do you learn... these rules..."

[Taichi]
"Powers of observation are needed. Right, then... for example."
//HACK to sky -GHS

Sitting in a seat at hand was a girl with glasses and mood dark. I approach her.
//Ambiguous. -GHS
Her and I will, in fact, be trading.
//And next he'll show you how to pull a rabbit from the top hat? Curious way to put it, 's all. -GHS
I clap my hands.
The gaze turned my way.
I hold a slice of pizza in front of her eyes.

[Girl]
"......"

She showed interest.
She tries to take it.
I take it a bit farther, and she ceases trying to take it.
That is her sanctuary: a radius of 30 centimeters of distance.
//Vs. a math folder... or seven? other people. -GHS

[Girl]
"..............."

She ponders, then the girl sets out the lunchbox. Towards me.

[Taichi]
"Okieeeh!"

I took one fried egg,
//Grrr, have to translate it as the same term in CCD2002 just doesn't work untranslated -GHS
and, in exchange, offer the pizza.

[Girl]
"..."
//The glottal stop っ was removed in the console version. FWIW. -GHS

Munch, munch she begins to eat down.

[Taichi]
"And, well, sort of like this."

[Kiri]
"...what was that now?"

[Taichi]
"Bartering is foundation. For her."
//See CCC0031B. Specific term 'foundation' -GHS
[Taichi]
"After that, she's fine with just her own world. Therefore, all that happens outside the radius of 30 centimeters she shows minimal interest in."
//Not none. -GHS
[Taichi]
"She has similar symptoms to a Savant syndrome as well, an abnormal ability to make simple calculations. Ask her about what day of the week it will be on a date several centuries ahead, receive an immediate exact reply."
//As long as it's September 1998, that's easy! This is more hints that basic math is needed here, thankfully no more. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Maybe she's just lost in the contemplation of an ocean of numbers."
//And they are all sevens. See CCX0001. This parallels to that odd sentence about the ocean of disjointed words: that's what Taichi is lost in contemplation of. It's more hints that Taichi is just, well, autistic. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...but can that girl be happy with that?"

[Taichi]
"Naturally."
[Taichi]
"The shape happiness takes is different between people, that's all."

[Kiri]
"...that is not right."
[Kiri]
"There might not be malice or anything, but, that is not right to me."
//This is what Kiri can't accept. In a sense, she wants to push a certain shape of things on people. But that's no more necessary than it is necessary for Cross Channel to quote the Bible every other sentence to be a ZOMGS BIBLE GEAMS soon 2 be published by Will subsidiary Willdom Tree -GHS
[Kiri]
"Because... when people exist... to still exist one by one as if solitary islands on distant seas... closed off..."
//Tomoki's island, or Yusa's? See above, Gunjou the Island Prison, though laterally it's also the Cross World in a more psychological reading. -GHS
[Kiri]
"That is just not right..."

[Taichi]
"......"

"Care about me, please---"
//around Switched. -GHS
It's just as if Kiri, all along,
had been shouting that.
//And the reason she wants to impose a certain shape of happiness on the world is because she doesn't believe she'll ever attain hers without it. It's why she's so easily convinced to secede, which Taichi reprises when he talks about her "finding a place where she belongs" - but not with weapons. (It's still Heaven tho.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is that your wound then?"

[Kiri]
"...eh?'

Shinkawa groans.

[Taichi]
"Oh, looks like Onii-chama's waking up."
//OHAIOOOOOO, TAKE IMOTO-SAN TO THE CULTURAL FESTIVAL -GHS
[Taichi]
"Do you really like-like Yutaka?"
//TOMODACHI-SAN CAME OVER TO, PLAYER WITH IMOTO-SAN -GHS

[Kiri]
"Well, I...... wait, wh-, what are you talking about?!"
//WE ARE PLAYING KAWAI KINGDOM HARTS AND NAR-UHTO. -GHS

She went red.

[Kiri]
"Ah! Seriously! Not like that!"

[Taichi]
"So easy to understand."
//Double meaning 'course. -GHS

[Kiri]
"It is not like that, I'm telling you!"

[Taichi]
"Nice, eh, Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"...ehhh?"

Yutaka woke up without a word.
He rubs his eyes.

[Shinkawa]
"...no way, I fell asleep again, I did...... eh, where's my pizza?"

[Taichi]
"All eaten."

[Shinkawa]
"What... the...?"

Mute amazement.

[Taichi]
"But I didn't think you were going to wake up, so..."

Yutaka gave a low moan,
but outside of that, there didn't seem to be any further complaints.
//See Tomoki with regards to Taichi, but not with his sister. More reading key. -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"..."

Instead, he seems to have been caught into a different interest.
He looks at me,
he looks at Kiri's red face,
and he thinks with folded arms.
Then Yutaka looked one more time up at Kiri.

[Shinkawa]
"O.K., I get the situation... marriage proposal's all proper and submitted then?"
//He's as good as Taichi at this stuff. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ceremony's tomorrow."

[Kiri]
"It is not!!!"

And that was one of the things that happened.
//So in general it was a good day. /end diary -GHS
