Late in the evening, Tomoki came and brought over the box of food.
From within it, I carefully selected something suitable and made it my evening meal.
//* something suitable = Tomoki's cucumber. -GHS
In my dark room, I throw myself on the bed and think about things, many many things.

A search for the Happy Ending:
that is what this behavior of mine should be called.
I act to comprehend to a certain extent the problems of these people, individual by individual, yet it isn't going well.
But the time is a single week and that's it.
And to get close to one single person yet takes... one week.
//Because according to the diaries it always does. After all, one route at a time. -GHS
For all the people it would take seven weeks.
//Still. -GHS
Even if I take out Sakuraba and Tomoki, as well as Youko-chan,
//NET separation between the first two and the third, for reasons that ought be obvious. Curiously, only Tomoki should be excluded since he's a "freebie" with Misato (in reality he's of course deeply bound to her, that's all). -GHS
it's four weeks.
I should just act at four times the density then... but that's likely never going to happen.
//His error of approach here is due to materialism: he's not seeing any possible life beyond the week. -GHS

"Harrrd..."
//So is my... uhm... erm... "cat" -GHS

With nothing like a solution to this having flashed into my mind yet, I gave into to sleepiness.
//...he's delusionally hopeful, isn't he. -GHS
