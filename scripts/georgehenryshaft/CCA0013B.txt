Touko was here.
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
Or should I say, alllways shooting for first place, ain't she.

[Taichi]
"'morning."

[Touko]
"...(pfuiri)"

Ostracism?
Is this ostracism I see?

[Taichi]
"Wear..."

[Touko]
"Be succint."
//Re: that monster above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Please buy what I wear?"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

[Touko]
"Whyyy would I ever need to buy what you wear?!"
//Overreaction, he asks 'please', she uses a stronger 'ought' -GHS

Touko stands, slamming fists on the desk.

[Taichi]
"All hott' from morning ain'tcha."

I give her a thumbs up.

[Touko]
"..."

Youko grabs my thumb tightly, and harshly twists it along with my wrist.
//"goki~!" is http://www.aadayo.com/aa/asciiart5115.html, harsh movement to the side. -GHS

[Taichi]
"GhyEEEEEEEH!!!"
//„Åàx7 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Morooon, what if you'd broken iiit! I would never manage to console myself agaaain!"
//"Console myself" means masturbation, word and all but the euphemism works better in every instance (no really), so it's a running gag somehow. -GHS

Very fortunately, she only barely managed to twist my wrist.
//Should make sense, she IS getting weaker. -GHS

[Touko]
"Stay back and do not talk to me."
//Don't talk to me + don't approach me. It's thematically important so I'll keep it at least around here, see CCD2002 for the most obvious explanations. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Did you watch TV last night?"
//See CCZAS -GHS

[Touko]
"Stay back and do not talk to me!"
//No denial of the existence of TV. Well, how damn convenient. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...mngh."

When I'm told in harsh tones not to approach or talk, I end up wanting to get close and talk.
//Frickin' contrarian. Remember that Touko subsists on a diet of bitterbugs. -GHS
I get close and talk to her, but once more she harshly tells me to stay away and not to talk to her.
//Mirrors strongly above. -GHS
CSQ 0 1 1
- Get close and talk to her
- Go to club activities
