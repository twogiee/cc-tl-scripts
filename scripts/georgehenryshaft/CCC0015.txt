"Senpai!"

I was called from the back.

[Taichi]
"Yooo."
[Taichi]
"Finished cleaning?"

Miki was startled.

[Miki]
"Wo-, wow, you're aware that I've been cleaning..."
//Translation: "oh shit you read the diaries" -GHS
[Miki]
"Did you see me?"

Dammit.
Diary information. Top secret.

[Taichi]
"...is keeping it secret even necessary now."

[Miki]
"What's secret?"
//Not Nanaka. She never comes up. The reason is because he knows, inside himself, that she doesn't exist. Proof via absence. And if that's the reason to keep her hidden from the rest... what if the reason to keep the loop secret from the rest is the same? No one but Youko (possibly Taichi's split personality) and Miki (Taichi's pupil) ever learns about it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh nothing, just talking to myself."

Ah well, I'll keep it hidden for the time being.
I should definitely do some of that sexual harassment, shouldn't I.
...I'm so debauched.
