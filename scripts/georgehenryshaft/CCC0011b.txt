I wonder if Kiri has come to school.
There were no records of sightings on Monday.
Fourth floor. First years' classroom.
//See CCA0021, third years are on third floor. Something is wrong here, but I can't exclude writing error. Unchanged in all versions. -GHS
Kiri was here.
I gaze lost at this scene.
A petite physique.
Full of young and fresh vitality that yet doesn't make her muscular.
There is just a pinch of sadness, no more, in the profile visible from her shifted back.
Her dark hair waves silky and smooth with the gesture she makes to cover her forehead.
A lovable girl... concealed in a thin, brittle glass membrane of youthful vitality.
When hurt she splinters fragments, and those occasionally hurt people.
//Like crossbow bolts. Or metaphorical knives. -GHS
Yet, the back draping off her narrow shoulders is delicate, so that she appeared completely defenseless.
...to the point where I could swoop down on and assault her.
She appears not to be aware of my presence.
