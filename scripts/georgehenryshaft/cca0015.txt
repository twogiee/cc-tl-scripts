[Miki]
"Ah, Senpaaai!"

[Taichi]
"Howsit."

A random encounter with Miki leaning against the wall, idling.
//Yes, it's a formal version of the RPG term. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What's up?"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, well, see..."
//Ambiguous, but in this case, it should just be Kiri in the toilet. -GHS

/太一「？」

[Taichi]
"?"

[Miki]
"Where are you going?"

[Taichi]
"Rooftop."

[Miki]
"...don't tell me, to club?"

[Taichi]
"I'm not going to tell you, but that's it."

[Miki]
"Ahhh...."

Miki was a little staggered.

[Miki]
"Seriously, club?"
//At this point she might not really be into his game that much yet. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, there's not much else to do."
[Taichi]
"But I'm only showing face, OK."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Wanna come with me?"

[Miki]
"Ah, well, right now..."

And,
from the girls' toilet, nearby, one girl comes out.
//Still loneliness, despite it all. -GHS
It's Sakura Kiri,
the other half of the Flowers.
A short-haired and somewhat androgynous girl.

[Kiri]
"......"

Kiri glanced at me, just a peek,
and then ignored me.
//Miki shocked doesn't seem to fit here, despite the console version. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Sorry for the wait."

[Taichi]
"H E L L O."

A greeting with full throttle eloquence. To Kiri.

[Kiri]
"...hi."
//Practically her catchphrase. -GHS

She returns the greeting as if it disgusts her from the bottom of her heart.
Obviously,
because Kiri hates me, extremely so.
However, the more he is hated, the more irresistibly attracted the target will become.
//Paraphrasis: "I'm an M". Analysis: Kiri doesn't understand how Taichi works. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Today's waaay hot ain't it. I knew it, it's---"

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki."

[Miki]
"Kiri, that's harsh..."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, let's gooo!"
//Shocked Miki here doesn't fit at all either. -GHS

With both arms spread towards the urchin (nice etymology), I line up to walk with them.
//Originally "okyan (from the Land of the Dead Words)" (AKA "old word"). It's a tomboyish girl. Adapted with the urchin, similar meaning, and it comes from hedgehog, seemed appropriate. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu-senpai."

[Taichi]
"What?"
//Compare Touko right around here. -GHS

She stops.

[Kiri]
"Me and Miki are going."
//Mascara again? -GHS

[Taichi]
"But the Flowers are trio of one heart and one body, alter egos!"
//First mention of Alter Egos, so put it literal as well, see CCC0000. The creep factor just goes up and up. And him trying to make a trio when Alter Egos are a duo, ouch. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...tsk."

A click of the tongue.
Whoa...
I felt a shiver there.

[Taichi]
"Well then Kiri, let's go on a date sometime. They're showing this interesting movie right now."

[Kiri]
"...have you gone insane, Kurosu-senpai?"
//Conveniently denying the idea of the date, not necessarily the very presence of movies. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Please stop with the jokes. If they continue, they will be ignored."
//If she DID, then she'd be relatively fine. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh my my."

I don't really intend to harass her seriously.
Should I leave it at this then? At least for today.
Sweet things are sweetest when tasted lick by lick.
//'Lick' is also 'to tease', but the undertone is overtone here. -GHS
Eating them in a single gulp is the way of the killjoy.
Wait, eating?

[Taichi]
"Come now! Go back inside!"
//The belly bug/madness/Youko/???/profit/wait/dev/null -GHS

I strike at my temporal lobe.
//See CCX0001, CCZAS -GHS
Kiri watched me with a puzzled face,
and even that for an instant.
//Ahhh, he attracted her attention after all. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Let's go... wait, what is it?"

[Miki]
"...my stomach..."
//See CCA0027. Imitative behavior. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Does it hurt?"

[Taichi]
"Does it hurt?"

[Miki]
"Ah, harmonics..."
//Specific, again see CCA0027 -GHS

[Kiri]
"...tsk."

I'm glared by Kiri.
...I'm a-lovin' it.
//http://www.osaka-info.jp/ja/model/osakaben/html/0048.html -GHS

[Miki]
"I might die but... you two, you can't be fighting anymore... ngh..."

[Taichi]
"MIKIII! Miki, you can't, stay away from that light! If you're not here anymore, who will be bearing my children!"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chan will... squeeze'em out like a machine gun..."
//Will recur somehow. -GHS

Hyper good news!

[Taichi]
"Seriously?!"

I press the question onto Kiri.
//Also get near her, but, well, he just asked a question and everything. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...Miki, stop messing around."

[Miki]
"Meown, you seriously mad?"
//Catlike -GHS

[Kiri]
"I'm not trading side dishes with you at lunch anymore."
//Funny when it'll be Miki who'll threaten her with permanent separation (by some definition of funny). -GHS

[Miki]
"But that's insaaane!!!"
//She's so poor she likely doesn't have side dishes... -GHS

She clings on to her.

[Taichi]
"...so it was a faked illness after all."
//*Nod* -GHS

[Miki]
"Nah, the pain in the stomach was... because, I mean... it's a psychological metaphor..."
//Nod, nod, noood. -GHS
[Miki]
"Oh whatever, you two get along already!"
//Significantly harsher. -GHS

She cried.

[Taichi]
"Eh, me? I caused this?"
//Hum, she explicitly used a plural. -GHS

[Miki]
"Please understand the feelings of sandwich filling."
//"Please understand what it's like to be squished between you two". This is about as bad as Misato's mirror thing, and of course ties to Youko via alter egos and the production of sandwiches as well as to hint to readers that what seems like two is too often three, which is distinguished from how eight is actually seven. And rereading what I wrote, I must say Tanaka's a bad influence sandwich. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bread slices and filling... a flower in both hands?"
//Adapted since both sentences start with "san". Not as obvious in English. -GHS

All the same, it can't be said to be a proper 3P of a threesome.
//See below -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bwh, waity there... the bread is the male part, could this be what is known as double penetratiooon? Even in porn you don't really see that stuff often, nooo!"
//It's slightly less odd a thing to say for someone who's spent his youth at sex orgies when read as silly and girly, as it is. Also: slice+filling+slice+3P+double penetration = 7. And if he doesn't see DP often in porn, he should effing improve his porn. -GHS

[Kanji with two men surrounding one woman that somehow only means "to tease" (3P-style).]
//Visual pun replaced with silly run-on sentence. This will also be referenced later, should be a callback about as tricky as the average anyway. -GHS
That's to nosebleed!

[Miki]
"Just hopeless, this Wonderfulian."
//Now the Alien called him alien. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...Miiiki!"

[Miki]
"Yes, yes. Bye Senpai! My apologies!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, me too, I gotta show face a little."

[Miki]
"Well then, the both of us take our leave."

I took a fencing stance.
//No karade? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri, for now I leave Miki in your care still... but there will come a day when her humble servant takes her for himself!"
//Adventure hero style, not too purple. -GHS

[Miki]
"Kyaaay, it's a love triangle and I'm the heroine〜♪!"
//With Taichi the girlish boy and Kiri the boyish girl vying for her. The point isn't played much beyond this scene, sadly. Say now, who's Harry and who's R-GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

Ignored.
And like that she walks away at a brisk pace.
Miki stays behind, and with a whisper in my ear she left the words,

[Miki]
"...Kiricchi's not a bad person despite this... sorry..."

[Taichi]
"It's OK."

[Miki]
"And that is why Miki really likes you, Senpai."
//Sudden third person affectation. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh?"
//Back to normal zoomed Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"I'd be nice if someday you would succeed in properly reconciling with Kiri-chin and be able to sexually harass---"

[Kiri]
"Miki, hurry!"

Miki jolted.

[Miki]
"Uhyyy, then well then!"
//Recurringly hers. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bai bai."

At a half-run she flows in with Kiri, and the two fade into the distance.
That right there was intended to cover for Kiri, wasn't it.
So charming.
I call out towards the backs of both.

[Taichi]
"Heyyy, you two!"

Stops in her tracks and turns around, however, Miki alone.

[Taichi]
"Be thoroughly careful with your physical conditions!"

Miki gave a vigorous salute, Kiri shed but a peeking glance.
