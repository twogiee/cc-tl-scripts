Rooftop.
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
I'm continuing work, when...

[Tomoki]
"Club activities?"

[Taichi]
"Yeppy yep."

Tomoki had come.

[Tomoki]
"...I just don't get the way you think, Taichi."

So Tomoki said.
However---
//And now see CCB0018 and CCA0022. As far as hint that even the non-sepia scenes may be flashbacks in a sense post Week 1, this is almost pathetically blunt. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"What I know is... just how to wire this antenna to the mobile equipment."

Fun pretend-a-club-activities.
They may become precious memories.
//End of the edits. These below are NOT new lines from the console version. -GHS
There will be nothing left in the memories, however.
I thought I would leave behind, in the diary, that a possibility like this exists.

[Miki]
"Goood mooorniiing!"

[Taichi]
"Could you go to the club room and bring me a new pair of gloves?"

[Miki]
"Just exploited out of the blue I am..."

She vanishes inside the building.

[Misato]
"Morning everyone!"

[Taichi]
"Backrub, please."

[Misato]
"Ah, yes!"
[Misato]
"Rubby, rubby."

Work continues while shoulders are massaged.

[Misato]
"They are not very stiff are they."
//Must be all the shrugging he made in CCC0014. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is a question of mood."

[Misato]
"Rubby, rubby!"
[Misato]
"Wait, why am I rubbing your shoulders!"

She noticed.

[Taichi]
"Unconsciously."
//Answers her question. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I am here."

[Taichi]
"Give me a good morning kiss."

[Kiri]
"Eh............?"

[Misato]
"Coercing that kind of things is not acceptable!"

[Taichi]
"Hah'gyaaah!"

It looks light but that fist was heavy.
//It's likely one of the many less-than-common transliterating, but like it happens several times, "heavy" is written with ヘビ(snake)+ィ instead of more common ways. Let's leave it at a "hmmm". -GHS

[Miki]
"I have fetched the gloooves!"
[Miki]
"Huh, he's asleep?!"
//Don't fall asleep yourself - she's serious, Taichi didn't get struck, he DID fall asleep! This is one of his bouts of narcolepsy. -GHS
[Miki]
"He just uses people, and then he himself sleeeeeeeps!"
//See Tomoki vs. Misato. -GHS
[Miki]
"...sentenced to the removal of trousers."
//ZUBOOOOOOON? -GHS
[Miki]
"Slip, sliiip!"
//See CCA0027 - zuru again! -GHS

[Misato]
"Wait Yamanobe-san, you are taking off his underwear too!"

[Miki]
"Slip, slip, sliiip!"

[Misato]
"Wait, waaait!"

[Miki]
"After all, once a woman has gotten this far, she cannot stay unsatisfied!"
//See CCA0012. -GHS
[Miki]
"I shall do nothing but penetrate through to the end!"
//Not actually a quote, though see CCC0041. -GHS

[Misato]
"Those are very Peke-kun-ish things you say..."
[Misato]
"We are teacher and pupil, that is why."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin Kiri-chin, c'mon c'mon, do you see it?"

[Kiri]
"I said I don't want to see it!"
//See CCC3002 (she literally did). -GHS

[Miki]
"Soo'reh, soooo'reh..."
//"Thattity thattity" is, perhaps, beneath even me. -GHS
[Miki]
"Bwaaah, it's ooout, it just went plonk, it's aaall out!!!"
[Miki]
"It has appeareeed!"

[Misato]
"And that is why I told youuu!"

[Kiri]
"Cover that up with something, reallyyy! It's making me siiick!"

Noisy, noisy, loud and noisy.
//Seems to be just an onomatope (that I can't source, natch) for loud chattering. Not the origin or connected at all... OR IS IT: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%A8%E3%82%82%E3%81%A0%E3%81%A1%E3%81%84%E3%81%A3%E3%81%B1%E3%81%84 Voiced by Tanaka............... Mayumi. Since Tanaka, like John Smith, is very much a rare name, this is obviously connected. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ngh, nngh..."

The loud noises made me awake.

[Miki]
"Myeeegow, I can't get close anymooore!"

[Misato]
"Th-, that is something that can never be put right again!"

[Kiri]
"Didn't you do this, Miki! Take responsibility now!"

[Miki]
"Impossible impossible, physically impossible! I am a virgin! This is something for our senior President-senpai!"

[Misato]
"Bu-, but I am a virgin too! That has nooothing to do with seniority!"

[Miki]
"...Senpai is also inexperienced then?"

[Kiri]
"I-, I am, too, so... it's absolutely impossible, and..."

[Miki]
"To us maidens, that bodily part is waaay to hard to handle!"

Boisterously noisy aren't they.
//Three girls are a crowd. -GHS
I stand up.
It was unusually cool.
//Why is Omata all breezy??? See CCA0015B. -GHS
A sense as if the wind is piercing directly through to the skin. Did I get a fever?

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm?"

In unison, the sights of the three turned towards me.
And then, in unison, all three were startled.
//That's probably when they realize he got hard. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What has happened, my three Ojou-sama?"
//Moved the "fu!" down here -GHS

I asked with gentlemanly tones and a smirk.

[Trio]
"KYAAAaaaaaaaaaah!?!"

Ear-pearcing scream x 3.
They ran away with the speed of a scared rabbit.
//Normally it just means "at top speed", but... -GHS
Therefore, I ran after them with the speed of a scared rabbit.

[Taichi]
"What has happened, nee-san?"
//See CCA0016 -GHS

[Misato]
"Do-, don't come near pleeease! Don't get any close, noooo, disgustiiing!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"

Rejected.
I was rejected.
Again and again I was completely rejected.
//See CCA0010. Not necessarily a comedy scene for him. -GHS
To be treated as disgust itself is my lot in life.

[Taichi]
"DAMMIIIIIIIIIIIIT!"

The chase turns frantic and desperate.
It was to cry.

[Taichi]
"Is it that weird that my hair is whiiite!"

[Miki]
"That is not the thing at fault at all! AHHH, don't get neaaar! Keyaaaah!"

[Taichi]
"Am I that ghastlyyy?!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahahahahahahah!!! Kyaaah-kyaaah-kyaaah!!! It's shakiiing!!! It's totally shakiiing!!!"

She seems to be the only one having fun.

[Taichi]
"But my heart is also shaking in heartrending sadneeess!!!"

[Kiri]
"Wa, you don't, don'tdon'tdon'tdon't, you dooooOOOOOON'T!"

[Taichi]
"Don't-ed so muuuch!"
//I'm learning so many new verbs. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Being hated in terms of personality, well, what can one do, but people who show revulsion at physical appearances are the wooorst!"

I foggedly change target.
//KIRIkaeru -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whasshadonnaaaaaaaaw!!!"
//Angranese. "What shall I do now" + "whatcha doin' now" -GHS

[Kiri]
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"

[Taichi]
"Oh yes oh YES, you are within reach Kiri-saaan!"
//Hokuto no Taichi now??? -GHS

[Miki]
"Ahhh, Kiri-chin is being rape assaulteeed!"
//That's a nukige term if I've ever read one, so here's a high class reference to the masterpiece that is http://vndb.org/v1292. (Yes, it's the same term.) -GHS

[Misato]
"You cannot go!"

[Miki]
"But Kiri-chin will... Kiri-chiiin!"

[Misato]
"We cannot save her anymore, no..."

[Miki]
"But if this continues Kiri-chin's chastity will be..."

[Misato]
"Let us escape, so that Sakura-san's sacrifice will not have been in vain!"
//Although Kiri has no problem, it's Misato the first to want to run. After all, she knows Taichi's not going to do anything, does she. -GHS

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin... sorry... I shall never forget you!"

[Kiri]
"Wait, are you kidding?! Senpai! Mikiii! You aren't humaaan!"
//Her sorta-catchphrase it seems. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Resigned to your fate, are you, Sakura Kiri... no... Love Slave Sakura Kiri!"

I corner her next to the fence.

[Kiri]
"Ngh, ngh, ghhh〜..."

She's half-crying.
I am more and more excited.

[Kiri]
"Ngh, ngh, ngh... do-, don't touch me molesteeeEEEEEER!!!"

[Taichi]
"Gw'haaa!"

Kiboshlessly kickdowned by Kiri.
//This one's just poetic license through and through. Also, not zubaaan'd... ah, the CG has him with pants so it's inconsistent. NOW he notices! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Gw'nuh."

As I was getting up, the trio were vanishing inside the school building with feverish haste.

[Taichi]
"...ngh... ngggh..."

I cried.
//...meaning he can... -GHS
These were the tears of humiliation.
//...for himself. -GHS
Is this sorrowful thing the truth then?
Is the value of a human in the looks?
I'm always being called 'cute' and 'adorable' and all that... are they all lies, then?
//This is also unserious of him; he always has a problem being called 'cute', as that's not manly. -GHS
White hair. Pupils with a peculiar iris. Nose maybe a little crooked.
With an appearance this bizarre it has to be expected.
However, there's no way I can change that can I?!
Like Michael, there's still plastic surgery, but...
//I think the reason this is being drilled in so hard (by this thing's standards) is because of the irony of Taichi being already de-facto albino. -GHS
There's no plastic surgery possible for eyes or hair in the first place.
And then... it would be unacceptably close to admitting defeat.
Awww〜.
Being rejected by people is truly heartbreaking innit...
//Desire for acceptance... -GHS
Sometimes, I just stop understanding why I keep putting on all this buffoonery.
//...threats of moral blackmail... -GHS
But I got no aim except to be a being loved by everyone, like the hero of a tale, nothing else!
//...impossible goals... -GHS
Well, I often exaggerate things a slight bit, and it's true that there's also a side of this that's a caricature, but...
//...inadequate admissions of errors... (left generalized because it's also his problems that he's exaggerating/caricaturing, saying without saying) -GHS
There is... but... dunno...
//...and perseverance on the wrong road. Splendidly human. -GHS

[Taichi]
"CoOoOovEeEr... diIiIsguiIiIse..."
//覆う oou. Of course it's "sob". Of course... -GHS

Odd sobbing moans.
The world was harshness, anywhere, anytime.
I hang my head.
My p0n00 was out.
//Wall of text justifying why references to Fate/Stay Night doujins are every bit as perfectly appropriate as ones to Kagetsu Tohya doujins. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What the hell is this!"

And furthermore, didn't it grow all twangy in ecstasy because I was being emotionally oppressed! Of course, I'm a masochist.
//And finally, the real monster is out. The scene above is actually the real reason why Taichi gets rejected: too much blatant sex drive. There's no other monster. -GHS
Trousers and undies where...

[Taichi]
"Whoa, all the way over there?"

That's the spot I was collapsed in.
I wear them back.

[Taichi]
"I get it... it's because the pyy-pyy was out then..."
//O-timchim, pee-pee in a weird cutesy way -GHS

That helped me feel a little better about all this.

[Taichi]
"Even then, why did you go and strip off the lower half of the body... me."
//He does that on the TOP half multiple times, such as CCA0002. He certainly believes he does that unconsciously, see CCB2010, CCA0017A. One of the rare times when readers are explicitly shown how wrong he can get with his self-diagnosis. -GHS

This was an incident with many mysteries.
Or should I say,

[Taichi]
"...I was seen... by all three."

I wanted to die.
And in occasions like these: Positive Thinking!

[Taichi]
"Wasn't it because I become Full Throttle that my Martianhood was discovered?!"
//See the beginning of this scene. That's him FT. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Is that because of the symbol of Mars that you have?"
//TL Note: ♂ -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's just because it's in a period of growth."
//I think the pun involves 性徴期 "period of sexual characteristics" (sic), actually, but this should still work. For those who get there late, the discussion involves Taichi's dick. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Huuuh. Didn't know that. How troublesome."

[Taichi]
"How long you've been there!"

I break down crying profusely.
...not only seen but heard...
Now the connections with my underneathers are but shredded tatters.
//Not a real word (.........), but it has to mean both "those below me in rank" and "TAKE A GUESS". -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Just now. So... here, right?"

The two were bringing in equipment.

[Sakuraba]
"Be unconcerned Taichi."

[Taichi]
"'bout what now..."

[Sakuraba]
"Within that size and expansion ratio there is certainly skin to spare."
//This doesn't make much sense, but being Sakuraba, it's likely he's actually not talking about his penis. ...wow, I actually can't believe that sentence has to contain a 'not'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It don't make me happy being consoled like that!"

[Tomoki]
"Anyway, how's this for now?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, thanks. Put them somewhere proper. Then take your responsibility and connect them."
//Seems to have odd undertones (odd = transparently sexual). Since the whole thing above was cut, and the two just ignore his questions because recording new audio = :money:, Taichi in the console version's a lot more pissed. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I'm being exploited... just exploited as convenient..."
//See Miki above... -GHS
[Tomoki]
"What'cha need next?"

[Taichi]
"We need batteries don't we now. Got any at school?"

[Tomoki]
"The ones we used for training camp, don't we got those?"
//So they don't rob them from the cars? How did Misato forget? Maybe it's just a minor plot hole, but given how the bread in the cafeteria goes from "discarded by Sakuraba" to "never brought in in the first place"... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Next we need a tent. The heat'll damage the equipment, and it'll get washed down if it rains."

[Sakuraba]
"But if tents we need, there are three right here."

[Taichi]
"What did you say, John? Where they are?"
//Unsure of the reference if any... unless he means "a" john? Maybe it's still John Lennon, see CCA0027. -GHS

I forced out the question.

[Tomoki]
"Sorry, but I already get the punchline to that."

Me too.

[Sakuraba]
"They are... inside our trousers."

[Taichi]
"Wahahahah!"

[Tomoki]
"Ahahahah!"

[Sakuraba]
"Heheheh."

But it still works.
Us Three Stooges, we reaaally love blue jokes.
//See CCZAS -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Then it's that, innit?"

[Taichi]
"Eh, what what?"

[Tomoki]
"Pffft... no-, normally they are always folded."

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahah!"

[Sakuraba]
"Hahahah!"

We make 'em one after another.

[Sakuraba]
"And, there's an individual difference in height."

[Tomoki]
"(Snort)!!!"
[Tomoki]
"And, and, they are One-Touch Tents ain't they. Tiny tents that assemble themselves by bursting open with a 'pop'. Add some excitement and just like that, up they rise as if instantly erected---"
[Tomoki]
"...pft... pft!!!"

[Sakuraba]
"...(snooort snort snort)!"

We slap our shoulder reciprocally as we hold our sides in laughter.

[Taichi]
"Patent 'em! Patent!"

[Sakuraba]
"Our tents are applied biotechnology."

[Tomoki]
"M-, my stomach's hurting now..."

[Taichi]
"And, if it becomes a hit and we're like asked in interviews where we got the inspiration from... we can answer, 'our dicks'--- pfft!"

Damn, I laughed at it myself.

[Sakuraba]
"...(snort)"

[Tomoki]
"Enough, stop!, stop, my abs are at the limit..."

The three of us reset our breathing.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, we need a proper tent don't we."

The conversation returns to its origin.

[Tomoki]
"Ahhh... didn't we have some some club budget reserved just for that last year. Did we even buy it after all?"
//Their first response still isn't "let's go to Atomic GS and pilfer some". Interesting. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry... that was flushed away and I'm to blame."

[Tomoki]
"Eh?"

[Sakuraba]
"...the Shinkawa Yutaka accident."

Those few words made the air solemn.
//See CCC0007. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...that's what it was."

[Taichi]
"Well, there's been my involvement too, in many ways."
//They probably don't know he was there on the rooftop. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Don't worry."
[Sakuraba]
"You are a man that can get things done on his own, I believe that."
//Probably some of the most touching words of encouragement Taichi will ever get in his life. No, he's not talking about the antenna. The penis jokes were before. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're just trying to get me to do this stuff on my own don't you!"
[Taichi]
"Do I even need to say why I sent those postcards dammit!"

[Sakuraba]
"Trust. What a beautiful word."
//See CCC3015. He's just never responding to his idiocies at all. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"The way you use that is messed up and dishonest tho..."

[Taichi]
"Cooome now, listen up and go get me a tent and some batteries!"

[Sakuraba]
"Then I will get batteries."

[Tomoki]
"I'll get a tent then... but do I got to bring it alone?"
//Source unsaid, but assumed Atomic. No mention of whether they'll pay for it, of course. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How 'bout a car?"

[Tomoki]
"...don't got a license... wait, right!"

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh, the pigs ain't anymore, Mai Furendo!"

In the first place, just up and making a broadcast channel would already be a crime.
//Though if Student Council President Mizum-- Club President Misato could get approval for 84% Taichi to join, the odds she doesn't have a license for this already are close to zero. It's to stare in disbelief at how easily everything fits. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I wanna try driving! But I'm not really familiar with cars 's all."
//He doesn't say he's TOTALLY unfamiliar with them. Of course: he's practically normal. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Manual transmission cars are simple yannow."
//See CCA0011C, CCA0018B. And this is why Taichi can't drive. Though it doesn't matter, since he can ride a bike, even if he doesn't make much of a big deal about it. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Manual?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah. The ones with three pedals."
[Taichi]
"I think you'll find some quick if you look in the faculty members parking lot. Just don't get the ones with two pedals, 'K. Those are fairly dangerous for an amateur to operate, so you know."
//It only looks like he's trolling him, because he truly believes this. And so... does he truly believe his lavatory is 8 tatami mats? Because he seems to truly believe there's 8 people around here. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Okkey."

[Taichi]
"So, Sack's with batteries."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah. Leave it to me, K."
//Damn translingual-sounding non-puns... -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"Got one question though."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Sakuraba]
"What shape do those have?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, take Sakuraba with you. You both get tent and batteries."

[Tomoki]
"...ah, I guess so."

Sakuraba was the kind of overspicy guy who will just make a mess of things when used stand-alone.
//"He fails at everything" + "that's why he loves curry bread without loving curry*" + "he's too hard to use". *=curry is Christianity, so being too obvious about it won't work. -GHS
The two left.

[Taichi]
"So then."

It should be noon just about now.
Tummmy felt empty.
Youko-chan's bento's there but... it's for two, as her usual.
Who should I eat this with.
Second year room... uninhabited.
I really want to know what's up with Touko.
Didn't she see the postcard?
...being an ojou-sama then she wouldn't check the post on her own perhaps.
//But she'll check a frickin' arrow letter, see CCB0022. Admittedly, that one might have been fired right into her bedroom as she was sleeping. -GHS
And, could it be she just doesn't even think that the mail would be delivered in times like this?
//Tomoki and Sakuraba sure did, and Sakuraba's even more of a wealthy ass than Touko is. -GHS
I should just go see how's things later on.
So, the first years' classroom.
The position of the posters is the same, but that's just accidental.
//See BG -GHS
The Flowers aren't here.
I try looking in another classroom.
Not here.
Here's the same.
Even the inclination of the books is similar.
//Left, near the window -GHS
Next then.
Even the position of the blackboard eraser is the same.
//Good questions to be had over this sequence. This is "Class X" and he's never leaving the room, is he? It's just masqueraded as an odd joke with regards to budget limitations, like the oddities in CCC3021. -GHS
It can be said that there is identity, can't it.
//I suspect it should be unclear whether this is rhetorical or not. -GHS
But it is assuredly coincidence. Assuredly it is.
//Sure. After all, the weeks aren't all the same, are they. -GHS
For the time being, there is neither Kiri nor Miki.
...they really ran away.
So where to go eating.
//Possible choice removed here, see main script flow file -GHS
