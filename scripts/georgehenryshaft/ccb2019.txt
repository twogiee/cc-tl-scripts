Rooftop.
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
We came and we saw and we were astonished.
//Ah, speaking of the eRoman empire... original is 来た、見た、勝った, the difference is minor. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...what the..."

[Touko]
"She did it..."

The antenna,
the wiring,
even the seat for a live broadcast and the tent were ready.

[Taichi]
"Senpai did this, alone?"

But the Senpai in question isn't here.

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"While you were indulging in sex, Senpai was wholesomely and also straightforwardly proceeding with club activities, Touko!"
//LET'S, HEALTHILY GOING TO THIS WONDERFUL WORLD -> Enter -GHS

[Touko]
"Wh-, why am I the only villain..."

[Taichi]
"Naaah, but still, surprising innit."

[Touko]
"...has Miyasumi-senpai not arrived yet, I wonder?"
//Ohhh, surprisingly girly/formal. Must be the Senpai respect. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't see 'er anywhere."

Maybe she's resting because it's Saturday?
But if I'm not mistaken, the scheduled date of broadcast beginning for the Gunjou Community FM Channel was tomorrow, wasn't it?
Then,
Touko beckoned me over from a distance.

[Taichi]
"Whassit?"

I approach.

[Touko]
"Here, here."

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

[Misato]
"...Zzznyah〜"

Sleeping.

[Taichi]
"Always doing things alone."

And it's for that reason, maybe, that Senpai got a little run-down:
the glasses are slipped off,
the uniform is disheveled.

[Taichi]
"..."

I bring in the nose to ascertain the smell.

[Taichi]
"A faint smell of sweat that feels bittersweet and---"
//See CCB0002, CCA0015B/C -GHS

[Touko]
"Cease this."

Thock!
That was a very realistic sound.
//See CCA0002 -GHS

[Taichi]
"(ow)"

It very nearly causes a cerebral concussion.
//Sooo, is the next scene a smack-induced hallucination? Because that'd explain the Youko public sex scene in CCD0022A, which is nearly identical in structure. -GHS

[Touko]
"It's bad to hold interests in the many and varied scents of girls!"
//See CCB2009 -GHS

The words 'many and varied scents of girls' themselves are fairly bad.

[Taichi]
"Question."

Raised hand.

[Touko]
"Go on, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Touko has never released a fart in front of this harmless young boy, therefore, where does she go do them? Furthermore, in those occasions, how far does she go to avoid being aware of the said?"
//Formal, boku, and third person (science demands it). -GHS

[Touko]
"What is even a fart I wonder?"
//Answer is "all of it". -GHS

Clearly asserted.

[Taichi]
"...grown strong ain't you."

[Touko]
"You say weird things."

Ohhh, Touko is diverting off my sexual harassment...
Impressive.
//Darth Vader voice. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh."

[Touko]
"Heh heh heh."

We laugh fearlessly, as if rivals bonding.
//Same as the "friendship demands" one. -GHS

[Misato]
"...nyahmh..."

[Taichi]
"Ah, she woke up."

She wakes up in case of suspicious confrontations in the space above her perhaps.
//Unsure of reference, if any. It fits with CCA0027, and she'll do the same in CCC0041. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hullooo, Senpai. This is Taichi."

[Misato]
"...w'at... Peke-kun?"
//'あれ' -GHS

[Taichi]
"The Taichi that is yours and yours alone I am."

Touko gives me a terrifying glare that I however ignore.

[Taichi]
"Tell me to suck and I shall suck. So, order me to suck at your pleasure!"
//It may be "to chew", but... I'm actually suspecting this is intentional. -GHS

[Touko]
"TA! I! CHI!"

[Taichi]
"G'wooooh!"

Her Iron Claw at the back of my head is right now quite painful.
But I shall endure!

[Misato]
"Uhm... why are you here?"

[Taichi]
"...ehhh, to see Senpai's beautiful sleepy face."

[Touko]
"Recall it."
//...what they came to do. -GHS

Touko whispers behind my back.

[Taichi]
"That was just a joke, and we only came to see how things are."

[Misato]
"The things..."
//Yeah, not you. Ner. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Seems the majority of the preparations have been completed."

[Misato]
"Eh, yes."

[Touko]
"...uhm, Miyasumi-senpai, did you do all this by yourself alone?"

[Misato]
"Yes... because..."

Senpai swallowed the rest of the words.
Hesitation itself clung to her face for a time.
And therefore I understood how she wanted to say this.

[Misato]
"Because this is my job after all."

[Taichi]
"Your job. It is therefore this one's job as well."
//Formal -GHS

I take her hand,
and kiss its back.

[Misato]
"Uhm..."

[Touko]
"......"

Huh?

[Taichi]
"Come on, stop it with the Harakiri Blade!"

A thunderstooorm?!

[Misato]
"Kyah, but how, so suddenly?"
//She may be referring to Touko's anger. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That Demon Sword... it has been feasting on people's blood for so many centuries, all because of that malevolent Grudge!"
//Of course, it's the history between the two and the pseudo-time loop and all that. -GHS

[Touko]
"...Abtall, Domroll, Omnis, Nomnis..."
//...Belles, Hollymac http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Eyed_One -GHS

Oh my trout, wha-, what sort of sinister spell is she chanting!!!
//See CCA0013... for what good it does. テルマス is a pretty big onsen in Kitahama. FWIW. -GHS

[Taichi]
"STOOOPPU! STOOOPPU!"
//He's turning American temporarily to remonstrate. -GHS

[Touko]
"...perish alongside Us..."
//我と共に来たり我と共に滅ぶべし same as above -GHS

[Taichi]
"Double suicide NO MORE!!!"
[Taichi]
"Okieh, okieh, calm down. It's just how we get along, see?"
//"This is just me and Misato getting along normally" seems to make more sense. Plus, well, it's true. -GHS

[Touko]
"...seems so..."

Did she actually get it?

[Touko]
"I think it is the kind of 'getting along' where you can make advances to that female without the smallest bit of care for me..."

[Taichi]
"OhWahWah!"

[Touko]
"It is all right. Be at ease."

She gives me a three-yen-coin smile.
//Barges are apparently fake in Japan. I KNEW it those things were suspicious... -GHS

[Touko]
"This sword can slice quite well, so only your worldly desires shall be lopped off."

[Taichi]
"Tha-, that's only the kind of things you read in a Kikuchi Hi**yuki novel, eh!"
//Vampire Hunter D author http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8F%8A%E5%9C%B0%E7%A7%80%E8%A1%8C hmmm "alien" series... -GHS

[Touko]
"...two-timer... philanderer... breeding horse... perverted kappa... hentai... libertine... sex offender... nymphomaniac...!"
//Seems to be the accepted translation of "erogappa". Hentai because, well, it's an insult in the end innit? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, aaAaah..."

All my Erosins back at me!
//They're 8. -GHS

[Misato]
"Glasses, glasses..."

On the very while that I had been undergoing a blindingly radiant life crisis, Senpai all carefree triggered a Where Are My Glasses scene.
//It's typical of people with glasses, it seems. Hmmm, the screen seems blurry, why is it... hey, where are my glasses??? -GHSearchedHisForeheadFirstAndFoundThemImmediately
Bwaaah, I have to record every last detaaail!
But I'm gonna diiie!
Cinematographer's greed and will to survive clash and fight.
//See how well "principal photography" as an euphemism for sex works? -GHS
...I want records!
Cinematographer's greed won.
And now that it's won, what do we do?

[Taichi]
"Guh, if I'm going to die...!"

I hug Touko's shoulders.
This is the last resort. No, the carnal resort?

[Taichi]
"Touko, ai-ai-ai-ai-Ai Rabyuu!"
//Compressed -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh?"

Prz'kiss!
//It's prezy-kissy. How damn appropriate is it at this point? -GHS

[Touko]
"Nnh, nh, nmh... nh... ahfh... aNh...... nh... nnnh... no, not the tongue inside... aHnh... uhhh, hlh... no-, no biting, no... NOOOooo..."
//See CCD0022A. Oh yes. -GHS

Hyper Deep Kiss.
//Console: "A Marianas Trench-like kiss", see CCA0011A, CCB0005, so those connect to Misato as well. -GHS
Or should I say oral sex.

[Misato]
"AhWahAhWah. Glasses! Glasses!"

Have to record thiiis!
But right now I am concentrating on MAITAN (My Tongue).
//It's basically a literal translation if you stop thinking about it and just let your head explode already. -GHS

[Touko]
"Ahmh... nh... nnnh, nh... nnnh... !... ah, Ah, NOnh... gonna take off... tongue... nh... nh... npch... hrhlh..."

[Misato]
"AhWahWaaahWaaah. Cannot see, cannot see!"

Glasses & Kiss.
//Now sounds like a reeeally bad anime. -GHS

[Touko]
"Nh... pchrh... ahMnh, nh, nnnh... TaiHiii... aHn, saliva, no putting inside... ahn, drink, gonna drink it, don't tickle me... nhnh, GLP!, nhkh, nnnnh... hFh, can't, drink all... aHn..."

[Misato]
"Bwah, cannot find theeem!"

Glasses & Kiss Returns.
//second season???????? why the hell did you renew this garbage? must be the fanservice. -GHS

[Touko]
"EhRhnh, nh, pch, pchRh... nhOOO, sucking, mine... Taichi tongue, suck... nh, pch... pchrhnh... nnnnh..."

[Misato]
"FOUN... not, these are nose glasses with mustaches for party use only are they... not the right ones..."
//As for why she would have those, my speculations connects the subtext here about aliens and a certain humorous conspiracy-themed adventure game from the 1980s I coincidentally happened to have played to death (or close) when I was a teen. That is all. -GHS

Glasses & Kiss RETURNS Second ~II~ Season
//The II is silent. -GHS

[Touko]
"Anh, fingers in... come ooon... ah, fwhAhnh, nAh... nh, I get it, gotta suck... aHmh... nh, pch, pch, nHnHnH."

[Misato]
"Ngggh. What are these? Ah, the night-vision goggles for night-time work..."

New * Glasses & Kiss ~the Moon and That Sky~
//Specific capitalization. This is hopefully getting ridiculous. -GHS

[Touko]
"...no... nnnh, nmh... nh... pch, pchRhRh... hFwahnh, sucking like this, like thiiiis... nh, nMhMh."
[Touko]
"Nhh!, nhhh!, nh... nHHHHHh, nh...... NNNNN〜〜〜〜〜〜!!!!!!"

Went.
//Screw it, tying with the next one instead. -GHS
Came?
Touko goes completely limp in my arms.

[Misato]
"Ah, found theeem!"
[Misato]
"Equipped!"
//The entire series was 7 lines despite 4 seasons. Must've been a British anime. -GHS

sha-KIN!
Mimimi-senpai has resurrected.

[Misato]
"...Kirihara-san, what happened?"

[Taichi]
"It looks like a cold."

[Misato]
"Her face is red is it. And she is all sweaty as well."
[Misato]
"Oh dear me, her body's shaking and quivering!"
//Now compare all this with CCD0022A. Very very very interesting. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, this is act... whoooa... Axion Reaction, yes."
//Not certain what he meant to say before he stopped. "うぉっほん" doesn't seem to have a special meaning. "Axion", see below. -GHS

[Misato]
"...Axion Reaction?"
[Misato]
"Is that not a very serious disease, is it not?"
//Seems to be intended as a positive, but giving Misato likely knows very well what just happened and is just pretending, it might be intended as intentionally confusing as to which negative is rhetorical and which is double. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is no big issue."
[Taichi]
"Welll, it'd be a nice if we found some of that dark matter."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion_Dark_Matter_Experiment core of it was 1995. -GHS

[Misato]
"...?"
[Misato]
"Will you please bring her quickly to Hasekura-san for an examination?"
//Still oddly off-tone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed. I will bring her with me and go."

Burden carried on shoulders.
//Multiple meanings, see CCA0015B -GHS

[Touko]
"...nh... Tai, chi..."

Her hot breath next to my ears is absolutely intolerable.
No sooner than we are back home... I forecasted "nonstop fever".
Before descending to the lower floors I turn around.
Senpai was standing, by herself, stock-still.

[Taichi]
"Ah, uhmmm?"

[Misato]
"Ye-, yes?"

[Taichi]
"...may we participate to club tomorrow?"

Senpai's pupils dilated slightly.

[Taichi]
"I'll be also bringing this here."

I point at Touko on my back with my chin.

[Misato]
"Ah... yes, go ahead..."

[Taichi]
"Bye then, we'll be by."

I turn back towards the door.

[Misato]
"Ah, uhm..."

Called to a halt.

[Taichi]
"Ma'am?"

And there, with a desperate face as if she had returned to her senses,

[Misato]
"Go-, go ahead..."
//Same as above -GHS
[Misato]
"Go ahead!"

She corrects but restates.
//Both, I guess. -GHS
In a loud voice.
A voice returns from my side as well,

[Taichi]
"'s a rojah!"
//[it]'s -GHS
