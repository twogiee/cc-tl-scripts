If I open this door, the rooftop will be there.
And there I know she will be, for certain.
On going to open the door there was just a bit of hesitation.
The training camp had failed, that I understood.
I asked a big favor, roped in Senpai.
That is something, I expected, that would have even wounded her.
Expected, but not really thought about.
And now, again, she... Senpai's going to be used.
For the sake of the peace of a heart.
And I also thought, how could one do this after all that?
Yet humans are animals of mood, and this morning that was the mood.
For myself, that is explanation enough.
But what will Senpai even think?
That was a little bit worrying.
Turning the handle, I push out the iron door.
The wind blew,
on the exact instant I stepped outside.
But, inexplicably, that made me feel all bright and cheerful.
Ahead in my line of sight, standing apart from the large water tower on the staircase with which it shares the foundation, stood a large antenna.

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."

A still unfinished antenna,
components and knowledge both insufficient.
Yet little by little it was taking shape, as that insufficiency was being supplemented by proactive feelings,
No.
They might just be pessimistic feelings, perhaps.
Because that is is something that happens from time to time.
Before the training camp,
she was alone.
Club activities have always been the final stronghold of her flight, this I know.
And now, again, here she is in the stronghold of her flight that are activities.
Miyasumi Misato.
Misato-senpai, right now, stands with the antenna, cradled in the wind.

[Taichi]
"Senpaaai!"

I called out to her, and the fan shape of her twisted about grandiosely.
//I'm not sure what's the proper name for this hairstyle. The one time the exhaustive traits in VNDB would've been useful... *grumble*. Notice the lack of black hair now. Hmmm. -GHS
A jet-black cape that swims in heavens tinted ultramarine.
//*cringe* See CCX0001, CCA0013, CCC3022. This may be a design error, but given what can be deduced from those, it may also be extremely intentional. -GHS

[Misato]
"Peke-kun?"

If I strain my ears towards all that she is, the nickname for her only personal use is conveyed,
//dat if. Also 耳+澄 = mimi + second character of her last name. -GHS
together with the movement of tender red lips.
This catching of a whisper in the midst of a squall in truth is nothing more than the Cocktail Party Effect, but still I lose myself in dreaming that some special peculiarity exists between me and Senpai.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect - he's admitting he's hearing what he wants out of her. -GHS
It's something of a delusion of happiness.
I step nearer to the infrastructure.
Senpai is smiling.
I too, naturally, begin to discompose the edges of the lips.
//See CCE0001, his smile and hers are equally fake. -GHS
The glances inherit harmoniousness.
//Suspiciously purple... -GHS
And then I, while surrounded by the placenta of mild and gentle meditation, am enlightened by the refined miracle known as Miyasumi Misato and led to an eager truth of profundity evermore deeply deep than the Marianas Trench.
//...and purpler. -GHS
........................her panties are visible.
//HACK hee hee -GHS
Visible visible!
Reeeally, reeeally, totally visible!
Seems we've already gotten in sight of Panchiraland!
And the person herself hasn't noticed it!
That is the most unbearable of all!
Peee-ping! Peee-ping! (alarm)
//HACK sky, NVL mode. Though a good argument could be made this should be still on her panties. -GHS
Banzai for the founding of the Commonwealth of
Panchiralandia!
A wonderful country that one!
A pleasant country!
May it be everlasting!

[Misato]
"..................?"
[Misato]
".................n?"
[Misato]
"..........Peke-kun?"
[Misato]
"Peke-kun, Peke-kun?"
//See CCA0016. These actually translate to 1 dot = 1 letter, in the original it was one ellipses (3 dots) per kanji. FWIW. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"Hellooo? Is anything the problem?"

Dammit, again my awareness damnably flew away.
//shimatta x2 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahh, no, no abnormalities here! Indeed, down to the toenails!"
//Should be "from head to toe", but of course... -GHS

[Misato]
"But you are dripping drool...?"

[Taichi]
"Committing seppuku now."
//Not harakiri. Supposing it's intentional. -GHS

I strip off my shirt.
//See CCC3004. You're doing this wrong. -GHS

[Misato]
"Wait, waiiit!"
[Misato]
"Why would you be killing yourself just for some drool?"

[Taichi]
"I have dirtied Senpai."

[Misato]
"I do not really get it..."

And that is most fine.

[Misato]
"More importantly, why are you here? What happened to classes?"

Classes...?
Returning to my senses, I stare straight into Senpai's eyes.

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"Ah, I understand. Cutting are you!"

With a finger raised.
What even the hell.
That was the her of always.

[Misato]
"Bullseye was it?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, well..."

In the proper course of soundness of her mind,
there was a derailment.
She is not accepting this.
This reality of the absence of people.
//See CCA0004. And yes, she could be the one not accepting the reality; or he could be. -GHS
For the rest, everything is normal.

[Misato]
"Playing hooky is not admirable you know!"

[Taichi]
"......"

Yesterday. On parting, after the training camp had concluded,
the impression that I got out of the words that came out of her was correct.
//HACK dim screen -GHS

[Misato]
『Tomorrow we do have club activities.』
//HACK back to normal -GHS

In a form so simple.

[Misato]
"This is a new term right after the end of Summer break, you cannot trail behind feeling like a C**a Cola with all the bubbles gone!"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"Tirelessly persist in maintaining a straightened self and approach curricular and extracurricular activities with zeal, for those are the virtues of a Son of Japan!"

[Taichi]
"......"

Engrossed to the point of befuddlement, as if repelling all views from the outside made only happiness remain.
Only that person has happiness.
//Avoiding gender for noooo reeeason at aaaalll -GHS

[Misato]
"Having said that, as in the very first day classes are not held, I will leave the reprimand with this."
//So now it's not half day, it's no day at all. I wonder if classes are not actually held on Monday. Not that it matters if it's like 1AM. -GHS

Right.
If there's happiness, that's enough.
The self desired by so many is not necessarily confined to someone of a consistent pure nobility.
The degree of force used to impose values on other is not what makes me great.
//See CCD1001 -GHS
More like, aren't I defective merchandise as well?
I shall permit it, and we shall cooperate,
in her flight of escape.
Because when I was alone... it was she who invited me to the Broadcast Club.

[Misato]
"Still, the truth is that I am cutting too."

Senpai thrust a little tongue out in a cute teh-heh fashion.
This is a command to the self, that I give with all the might of my volition:
play the part.
//See CCB0022. Whoops. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mine is the silence of agreement."
//That's what that means. -GHS

Senpai smiles 'till her eyes squint.
The smile of always.

[Misato]
"Please be patient some more."
//Not shouted, because, uhm, how does she stay above and still talk, and, uhm SYMBOLISM? -GHS

She descends.
By the time the tip of her toes had touched the floor, it was as normal for us both.
//Curiously, no version has any graphical change at this point whatsoever. -GHS

[Misato]
"Yeee-s!"

[Taichi]
"Senpai, please listen!"

I took the Direct Horizontal Straight Punch posture of the 『Ultimate Unarmed Martial Art * Karade』.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
* Direct Horizontal Straight Punch---
A straight fist attack to horizontal areas.
The foundation of Karade includes offensive
strikes for every direction, in particular, a
Straight Punch can control a wide area that
only excludes the back.
Similarly, in Karade there exist techniques to
control directly above and directly below
that could never be conjectured in ordinary
martial arts.
//正拳突き actually means a normal, Karate-like straight punch. -GHS
While this most odd form of attack finds most
certainly no opponent or rival among the life
forms of this Earth, preparation is the key
to success.
Its strongest significance is in those unlikely
events of confrontation with enemies where
Karade becomes the sole and only form of
resistance. For indeed the whole world is
metagame.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
It has a form similar to that of a sumo wrestler ceremonially raising and then stomping his feet, but let's not worry about that.
//Stab stab stab that mood -GHS

[Misato]
"Wha-, what is it?"

Senpai also takes the stance of something with a meaning I couldn't comprehend.
//dat also. See CCA0016, CCA0019. What a nice family portrait. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I wish to participate in the club activities I have been dodging until now. Oss!"
//Formal salutation, it's used like that even in martial arts classes not in Japanese, to my personal experience. -GHS

[Misato]
"Whaaat did you say?!"
//tsundere??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"From school swimsuits 'till the plain underwear worn over panties in sports (bloomers), Kurosu Taichi will offer his disgustingly lascivious support to your Club Activity Life!"
//http://d.hatena.ne.jp/keyword/%A5%A2%A5%F3%A5%B9%A5%B3 -GHS

[Misato]
"I am getting the giddies from imagining that!"
//'giddies' seems so wrong -GHS

[Taichi]
"A terrifying rejoice of delight is in I!"
//Visuals -GHS

[Misato]
"Did you hear that as a compliment now!"

[Taichi]
"There exist no possible ways for contemplating other interpretations!"
//See CCX0001 -GHS

[Misato]
"You are sooo intelligent! You are so very intelligent, in fact, that I suspect you made an entire revolution back into being a complete idiot!"
//...well, this IS Touko's route... -GHS

[Taichi]
"The difference between Us and a genius is what could be called paper-thin, then!"

The two of us amuse ourselves in weird conversations while we pose in weird ways.
Yes, this is what club activities are.

[Taichi]
"Indeed, from a oil-coated bust massage to wild strawberry hunting, your worthless meat-love slave has a wide range of uses, so order however you please!"
//Misato's nipples, see CCA0016 -GHS

[Misato]
"Well."

Caught up in the moment, my mouth runs off unconsciously into the perverted.
Senpai is very stern in regards to perversions (slow on the uptake though).
Oh joyful event then, that Senpai is just smiling broadly.
Did she not notice that sexually harassing utterance right there?
Then, the lips of an angel that made me experience the kindness of God the Father announced:

[Misato]
"Be ye forever gone from this place!"

[Taichi]
"The moment I put my hands on that Chinese stock was the start of my life's ruiiin!!!"
//Number one in a series that I shall name, "Taichi the Failed Speculator" -GHS

I make my rawly graphic shout towards that everexpanding everpure blue sky on the other side of the fence.
Well, Chinese people that can be laughed at for being able to eat anything on four legs but desks are themselves no longer among us anyway.
//I thought the idea of eating desks was just a funny figure of speech that meant something like 'living off a desk job', but, no. It's a Japanese sorta-racist Chinese stereotype. http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1328109658 -GHS

[Taichi]
"The antenna seems to have mostly taken shape, has it."

[Misato]
"Yes, I gave it my all!"
//Same as CCA0006: no problem changing topic. -GHS

The conversation continues normally.
As far as this goes, the nature of my relationship with Senpai is certainly strong.
Even with the Fall of the World it did not break.
//See at the top. The end of all people is not exactly at the top of the list of reasons it would break. This is another transparent contradiction. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is it complete already?"

[Misato]
"...not at all yet, it is not."

The antenna should have been assembled by the contractors,
but it was just brought in and then abandoned.
//HACK thinky Misato. This isn't in the first week, but the mood's noticeably different here. -GHS

[Misato]
"I am not a specialist, but by hook or by crook I am putting it together."
[Misato]
"The frame may be fine, but I have not laid hand on the wiring or the tuning."

[Taichi]
"Oh my my."

Sad as it may be, I'm no expert on those things either.

[Taichi]
"...seems unlikely that I could help you outside of some disgustingly lascivious support then."

[Misato]
"Disgustingly lascivious support will entail a suspensio〜n!"

Sooooftly, sooooftly.
My head is sooooftly caressed.
//I'm just gonna slooowly back away now. -GHS
/太一「うるきゅー」

[Taichi]
"Mnryukuh."

A note from the throat.

[Misato]
"Good boy good."

[Taichi]
"Nnnh, nnnh..."

[Misato]
"It is best if you suitably reveal your past psychological traumas as you keep blurting out this kind of mimetic and onomatopoeic words, all while you act in ways easily understood such as making an embarrassed face or burning with jealousy!"
//FINALLY some progression towards the moege! -GHS

[Taichi]
"I shall become that so very matter-of-factly yes I will!"

[Misato]
"That is the expected wish of the general public!"
//Told you it's about moege. -GHS

[Taichi]
"General public, blech!"

Not that it's any longer among us anyway.
//Same as the end of that Chinese Desk line. -GHS
I chanced to look closely at Senpai's hands, and they were covered with scratches.

[Taichi]
"WOAAAH!"

I took her hand.

[Taichi]
"They're all full of scratches!"

[Misato]
"Eh, ah, so they are..."

[Taichi]
"'cause you're doing this alone."
//HACK crass Misato instead. -GHS

[Misato]
"......"

She averts her eyes awkwardly.

[Taichi]
"Is the idea of doing it with everybody problematic?"
//Well of course it is, the poor lady, group sex proposals so early... -GHS

[Misato]
"With everybody you say..."

Senpai, in an instant, seemed to lose all words.

[Taichi]
"Come on, this is club! Would that way not feel better?"

[Misato]
"B-, but, now, doing that would indeed be so very hard would it not."

[Taichi]
"There are ways. Capturing those guys merely requires making use of the most suitable pieces."
//Very specific term for Capture. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The same way that, in a three-way standoff, the frog that is home to a snail can then make it influence the snake into cooperation, it is of crucial importance inside human society to have the precise skills to strike at vital points."
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E3%81%99%E3%81%8F%E3%81%BF "Frog is home to a snail": http://dic.nicovideo.jp/oekaki/612042.png -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because, theoretically speaking, if the pieces one has in hand because their price can be paid are employed with calm quietness to strike at the position most exploitable for a friendship, conquest must come into being."
//Possibly about how certain routes can unlock others? How certain friends/nonessential characters can help with reaching the capture with a certain heroine? I think it's about fixed patterns, actually, but it's filtered through so much half-understood pseudo-nihilism that it's almost impossible to understand. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Of course, following the progress of the chart, as management grows more complex, the situation demands the addition of a new element: the rearing and stationing of a supervising administrator."
//As the design (flow)chart gets messy, one needs a project supervisor? -GHS
[Taichi]
"However, as we proximate to this area, it becomes a necessity to touch upon Machiavellism."
[Taichi]
"Itself, with regards to the means as recorded in that Mein Kampf to create that theatrically dramatic feeling, which is what open political swindling could be called..."
[Taichi]
"...they are permissible, as one must take into consideration of the aspect of the desire of the illusion of happiness in those subjected to them. So, for the sake of bring Mein Third Reich to success..."
//Swindling, see CCA0027, CCA0030, and pretty much every other time Touko opens her mouth outside this route really. Awesome that the Third Reich joke was censored in the PS2 version, but the Mein Kampf reference was not. Ah, Japan, you never fail me. Taichi's seemingly inane, barely comprehensible, apparently nonsensical utilitarian pseudoeducated view of eroge design only seems insane until considering that Cross Channel is probably more subversive than what the idiots who would read this garbage and seriously believe it deep think they are. -GHS

[Misato]
"HaWahWah!"

Senpai was shivering and clattering all over.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun got so very evilish..."
//Third person, see CCA0010. The content's different, but the behavior isn't. -GHS

Condemn it!
//Weirdly formal -GHS
Perhaps as the outcome of having done nothing but reading garbage in order to adapt to the circumstances that demand groundless garrulity of us young boys of today, I have stupidly and unconsciously played like a tape recorder.
//Someone sounds less than happy about the kind of VN writing that would play straight and seriously the type of quasi-intelligible nihilistic crap as seen above. I wonder if this is what the girls at the Hasekura tea parties wanted him to "talk" about. Shudder! -GHS
When in front of Senpai I should be a most upfront manservant!
//Boku wa manservanto de aru de ari-desu-nya. -GHS
And for that purpose, I've decided to swindle her.
//You just gotta love a guy that just decides to take his own words and systematically stab himself in the gut with them. -GHS

[Taichi]
"AHH! My head...!"

[Misato]
"Are you alright?!"

[Taichi]
"So-, so painful... mother!"

[Misato]
"Ahhh, steadfast!"
//See CCA0016 -GHS

I flop into Senpai's chest.

[Taichi]
"I do not know how, but right now the queer Outer Space Hyper Intelligent Being OMRUS has eroded the parallel universe history across the Ergosphere via the wisdom of the Essenese!"
//HACK other sweatdrop Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"I do not really understand, but please keep being a good boy!"
//Stay good, Taichi! *poing, poing* -GHS

[Taichi]
"Get ooout, leave this poor boy and get ooout!"
//See CCB0004C. This still works with the above: he's pushing this out because it's too hard to accept, see CCA0003. It doesn't matter, he'll live it even if he explicitly doesn't accept it. -GHS

[Misato]
"Get ooout!"

I got reinforcements.

[Taichi]
"uWoh!"
[Taichi]
"Whew... seems like I have been saved! And while I was at it, the spiritual crisis of the macroverse also got resolved!"
//ついでに, see CCA0006. Have YOU been saved? Taichi has. And maybe his behavior also saved the world by somehow bringing the Good News to his own corner of it! -GHS

[Misato]
"You were saved by some really rapid developments."
//fucking 20 hours of nothing and then all the plot at the end amirite amirite. Slightly more seriously, of course: the bad guy was the good guy all along. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nah, not at all. Hahahah! It feels like grateful emotions have arrived from the Seventh World."
//7 -GHS

[Misato]
"Somewhat freaky..."
//SF, see CCC0016A. The above is therefore a valid explanation. ...but you see why I left this in the script, I hope. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And with that, here is the Taichi of always!"

Doing calisthenics to show off the Taichi of always.
//See CCA0030, there's that 'taisou' again, no confusing kana here. -GHS

[Misato]
"Good work then!"

[Taichi]
"So, what shall we do?"

[Misato]
"Right, yes. Then..."
[Misato]
"Could you then please bring me something cold to drink?"

[Taichi]
"Yes! ...wait, that's it?"

[Misato]
"Yes. No particular issues with the rest."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Pondering.

[Taichi]
"Could it be that I am... intruding?"
//HACK changed doll earlier -GHS

Senpai, becoming flustered, flapped and waved her hands around in denial.

[Misato]
"That, no, never! Just... this is something I have to do individually."
//HACK puffy Misato -GHS
[Misato]
"Dragging other people into this is not necessary."
[Misato]
"..."

Continuing silence.

[Taichi]
"..."

Senpai's club activities are something for her alone,
that's the phrase that crosses my mind.

[Misato]
"This is just me doing something that I like."
[Misato]
"It is the same for everybody."

[Taichi]
"Everybody... but they are not doing anything they like doing, you know?"

[Misato]
"They are not?"

[Taichi]
"I do think so."
//HACK NVL mode, Touko insert. -GHS

Touko, for example.
Does she really have a need to come to school?
When we came back from the camp and there was
nobody anymore, we were cut off from civilization.
Radio, telephones, the net, all silent.
Running water, electricity, gas, all interrupted.
We do not even know the cause of that.
//HACK out with Touko -GHS
So for us, this powerless Boy-Meets-Girl
archetype that we are, all that is possible
is the repetition of ordinary days.
//Given all the above, assuming it's meant to be literally the story trope: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%BB%E3%83%9F%E3%83%BC%E3%83%84%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB -GHS
Adventures or quests we can't do.
Those are out of the question.
Because our hearts are something paralyzed.
//That's also a bit of cough-cough handwaving as to why these people won't leave, or change their behavior, in a sense. -GHS
For us, the Ultramarines of Gunjou, that
is especially true.
//expanded, same as CCA0016. -GHS
Under present conditions, the only person not to
have taken some form of mental damage would be...

Youko-chan alone, maybe.
//HACK out Youko -GHS
And... that girl.
//This stays in dimmed mode, because tweaking back and forth makes it look like the screen's flashing. -GHS
...what even...?
I don't get that.
What I get is,
she's something like Youko-chan, a special case.
There's just that sense of physical discomfort.
That was the limit for myself as I am right now.
All that aside.
There is no expectation that Youko-chan
would become discomposed, not even with
the disappearance of humanity.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"There's nothing else that we can do but to repeat the same life we have had until now."
//HACK uhmmm this doll instead of that doll. -GHS

Senpai's face turned serious.
I was letting my face deliberately fall into an especially beaming smile.
//Visuals -GHS

[Taichi]
"And that is why I have given going to school a try!"
[Taichi]
"Also, Harakiri Touko has come in as well."

[Misato]
"Kirihara-san, too?"

[Taichi]
"She was just sitting and spacing out."

[Misato]
"So she was..."

[Taichi]
"Well, Sakuraba and Tomoki will eventually swing back, I think."
[Taichi]
"Say what you like, but those guys are close to that wholesome healthiness."
//HACK smiling Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"...that would be good, yes."

With just a bit of hesitation, the corners of Senpai's eyes fall into a happier look.
She was forcing herself, that I understood.
Doing her best to keep up that bright cheerful behavior.
My heart ached.

[Taichi]
"...then, if there is anything I can help with, please say the word."
//HACK beaming Misato instead -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, yes, if that time comes..."
//useless now -GHS
[Misato]
"Without fail!"
//HACK sky -GHS

Under this Summer sun,
Senpai remained, while I departed,
closing the iron door and reentering the school building.
I look back and I can see that she has been watching me leave all along.
