I shrug my shoulders.
//And one. See CCC3004. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But of course there is. Business, I mean."
//Same word as CCC0013B, but since it's possible to get here from CCC0013A, flattening. -GHS

Kiri's eyes narrowed. With resentful bitterness.

[Taichi]
"Miki-kun's not around I guess?"
[Taichi]
"...she is not here."
[Taichi]
"Is she coming?"
[Taichi]
"...she is not here."

Her dialogue appears from clenched teeth that say all about her willingness to go over the details.
//Visuals. -GHS
I shrugged my shoulders again.
//And two. -GHS

[Taichi]
"No port in this storm then."

[Kiri]
"True, there is none."
//No one for her to rely on, but also no one to stop her... -GHS

I sit in a chair at hand.

[Taichi]
"Reeeally, menses that harsh, mh. Damn if this isn't a depressing period of time! But come on, humanity has fallen."
//Meaning is "stop being crabby just because you're on your period, we're in a bad situation here", see Touko (except Touko doesn't seem to be on her period, unlike Kiri). Also, although Taichi's being an increasingly colossal dickwad, he has a point and this is the first hint of Kiri's hypocrisy on the subject of remaining unchanged after the end of the world. Made "period of time" explicit because seriously have you been reading this? -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

A fixed stare towards me,
with the impression that she is being vigilant about every single action of mine.

[Taichi]
"Saaay, Miss Innocence."
//We can spare the Engrish... THIS TIME! -GHS

[Kiri]
"Please do not call people by that name."

[Taichi]
"Saaay, Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"Please do not call me in overly familiar ways."

[Taichi]
"Bofff."

I shrugged my shoulders. Third time.
//And three. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Me, I'm reaaally being teased a lot aren't I."
//He's taking her replies as teasing, coherently with his being an ass throughout the scene. -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

I stand from the seat.

[Kiri]
"...!"

Vigilance gains strength.
She had goose bumps.
How sooo cute.
//~SUPAH trying to avoid SUPAH~ -GHS
The sadistic Masoch that I am finds satisfaction in this character.
//Leopold Ritter von Sacher Masoch, who is actually known for Sachertorte and toootally not masochism at all. Taichi's definitely masochistic, but this conflation-ish juxtaposition is not out of character at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Heheh..."

[Kiri]
"...?"

I laugh fearlessly. Kiri becomes perplexed.
//Same as with the Friendship Demands line. -GHS
With a lowered waist, hers is a posture that allows running away at all times.
//Like a small animal, especially a cat. -GHS
I just moved a bit like that, no sudden motions, and stood in front of a specific seat.

[Taichi]
"If I remember right, this is your seat, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Please do not call me without honorific..."
[Kiri]
"...remember your place in society."
//That of monster, see CCC3009 -GHS

It was a knife.
//Her words. This likely explains the crossbow metaphor, at least until it turns to catspeak. -GHS
Piercing with slashes and thrusts.
//Visuals. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your seat, Sakura."
//Mirrors the above. -GHS

With ponderated motions I go to sit.

[Kiri]
"STOP!"

She shouts at the end of her wits.
I stop on the dot.

[Taichi]
"Why should I?"
//Shouldn't have any special meaning, but... -GHS

[Kiri]
"...it will be filthied."
//See CCC0000. Oddly, right side is the reading key. I think Tanaka did complain about some actresses not knowing lots of words in an interview... -GHS

Her voice lowers deliberately, seemingly from the embarrassment at having lost composure.

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh. No helping it then."

I sat.

[Kiri]
"AAAH!"

[Taichi]
"C'moon, Uranus is showing! I'll give you some dead batteries, free of charge!"
//Lame (old people's) gags. First is a terribad pun on "natsu wa atsui" (Summer's hot), unsure about the second but it should be a bad pun on Oda Nobunaga. Unsure because results are mostly squatted by an anime character of same name (Noda Obunaga), which itself should be a reference to the same lame pun. Does not seem like the two together are a specific reference to anything else. Replaced with suitably horrible ones (thanks Twitter @ThoseLameJokes and the Bad Pun Coon). The c'MOON/URANUS thing wasn't intentional before editing, but it is now. -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Taciturn?"

Kiri's shoulders were trembling.
Was it mortifying to that extent?
//Should possibly be visible that he's truly not realizing how much of an asshole he's being. -GHS
Hers seems like heartless hatred.

[Kiri]
"What did you come here for."
//Let's not pretend there's an actual question mark in this sentence. -GHS

I smile brightly.

[Taichi]
"For Miss Innocence's INOSENTO chastity."
//Desu♪. -GHS-desu♪

[Kiri]
"...please go away."

[Taichi]
"But I still haven't done anything."

[Kiri]
"Do you have a mind of doing even more then?"

[Taichi]
"Whaaa〜t should I dooo〜."

I worry.
Touching the glasswork would leave fingerprints.
That makes me hesitate.

[Taichi]
"Fine, I'll stop."

[Kiri]
"......"

I was ignored.
Ignored maybe, a knife maybe.

[Taichi]
"Let's just chat a bit."

[Kiri]
"Please go away."

I shrugged my shoulders. Fourth time.
//And four. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, you brought the classroom stuff with."

I check the contents of Kiri's bag without permission.

[Taichi]
"Today was nothing but opening ceremony though. Ah-ha, of course, you're the type that brings all the textbooks on the first day and leaves them here, aren't you?"
//This is further telling: she isn't changing that part of herself either. She's even worse than Touko. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Please do not look inside without permission. Please do not touch my bag."

I shrugged my shoulders. Fifth time.
//And five. -GHS
Don't I just keep being made to shrug my shoulders.
That's our Sakura Kiri for sure.
The girl nicknamed Miss Innocence.
//Likely her actual Club nickname, see CCC3004 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whatever I do you just get hurt."
//Glasswork -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you tired?"

[Kiri]
"Whose fault... would that be..."

Her voice was shaking. Because of anger.
Her Always is much more curt, indeed it's gotta be the Fall of Mankind.
//My ass, she's always like this. -GHS
Kiri herself is trembling considerably, as if the wall around her heart was growing unstable.
//心の壁 seems to refer to the barrier around one's heart that keeps distance from others. Hum, does this count as an Evangelion reference...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"That'd be my fault, right."

I giggle.
//Girly. Except Kiri has no way of knowing his backstory, so this would sound fairly evil. -GHS
I shrug my shoulders.
//And six. -GHS
I wobbled as I relaxed by shrugging at high speed, then relax from that with a shrug, a comical motion.
//This sentence sounds off without realizing the first part refers to the shrug just above, and therefore the shrug he cancels into(?) is the seventh. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...won't you please... leave now."

She's frantically trying to bear her own exasperation.

[Taichi]
"...YESH."
//Intentional -GHS

I made her too angry,
it's time to depart.

[Taichi]
"Ah, say, can't we eat lunch together?
//And of course, the words in excess. Wouldn't be Taichi if there weren't. -GHS

Kiri stares in blank amazement.

[Taichi]
"...not happening then. Bye then. Sends my best regards to Miki-chin."
//Original said Kiri-chin. Typo fixed in the console version. -GHS

And that's when I left the classroom.
