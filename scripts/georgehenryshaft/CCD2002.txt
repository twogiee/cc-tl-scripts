At the time Touko had first come to Gunjou,
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
the gal had laid out a high wall between her and her surroundings.
It accompanied her as if her subordinate.
One glance and I was attracted.
It was that catlike disposition of mine.
//No, it was him being attracted to aloof girls. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hey."
//It's probably the same non-split as seen throughout the fourth week, where all voices were assigned the number of the first script. The numbers themselves imply these flashbacks were recorded after the rest of the route. -GHS

[Touko]
"...what now?"
//First time she's called out and she immediately responds. Contrast her behavior of ignoring that'll come later. Forget 25 points, she's not even 7. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're rich right?"

[Touko]
"......"

I was ignored.
//No he wasn't... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"...what."

[Taichi]
"You're a pretty girl aren't you."

[Touko]
"............"

A vague indistinct twitch of her cheeks.
And with that, I got the general feel of her behavior.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
HACK different transition back -GHS
And now as well Touko is there, being as her Always,
as every week, just as every week.
I have come into contact with an uncountable number of Toukos.
//I don't really wanna pluralize names, but--- wait, 'but' is just one letter off from 'butt' HOLY SH-GHS
I have only seen endings so horribly far from happy.
I and Touko, repeated over and over,
//Their relationship, not just them separately. It's why it ends like it does. -GHS
and it's always failure. What a laugh.
...words might just be unneeded, maybe.
Merely looking, nothing more, would perhaps be best.
That might be what is called a bond, perhaps.

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"........."

[Touko]
"........."

[Taichi]
"...................................."

[Touko]
"...what do you even want!"

The rage shoots upwards.

[Taichi]
"You're so pretty, ain'tcha."
//PCP above -GHS

[Touko]
"Wh--- wh-wh-wh-wh!?!
//5 'na' + 3 dashes = 8. Except it's still 7-7, and if -=na, then 4x7. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hahahahah."
//8x4 due to Katakana. -GHS

I was chased out.

[Taichi]
"Not happening, then."

This is very difficult.

[Taichi]
"It's that unchanging punchline of always... then."

Ah, whatever.
Let's go leisurely, I thought.
//I suspect this part here was originally the losing path for this route. -GHS
Touko was in the classroom all absentminded, as she always is.
Without a purpose either, merely being there.
Because there was nothing else she could do.
Touko was inertia and nothing more.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"...eh...?"

Touko's perplexed at having been called by name.
//Probably because he didn't use onirifics (they're like -sleep, -dream, -allnighter and stuff). -GHS-allnighter

[Taichi]
"Put out your hands."

[Touko]
"...no way."

Good. She had bite.

[Taichi]
"I can imagine what you'd be vigilant about."
[Taichi]
"However, this time you're wrong."

[Touko]
"Didn't you also say that before!"
[Touko]
"And didn't I just get deceived!"

[Taichi]
"...what a problem, right."

[Touko]
"It's obvious you want to put it in my hands..."
//See below. And her problem with it was...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"What a pleasant thing for you to say! It's not like that."
//The only other time "goaisatsu" was used was in CCA0022, by Yusa's mom. This fits, as the "experiment" thing is the same as with Yusa. And about as truly an experiment. -GHS

[Touko]
"I! WILL! NOT!"

Mngh, tough-handed.
Brute force then. Manual violation.
//手込め tegome is, naturally, a word for rape. But reads literally "fill the hand". If you're asking how that leads to rape, you still don't understand Rule #1 of Japanese: don't ask, just run in the opposite direction as far as you can. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hand."

I grab her hand forcibly.
The urge to just slip it in her hands does swell up, but I stiffly endure.
//fnarr, fnarr. -GHS

[Touko]
"Really..."

That face suddenly went pale.
She likely still thought she'd be hand-raped.
//This does NOT GIS to anything weird! You disappoint me, Japan. -GHS
I wanna do it, but now I don't do it.

[Taichi]
"It's like your mommy used to make."

Pik pik pik.
In her palm rolled candies three.

[Touko]
"Ah."

[Taichi]
"You can be at ease. My two hundred million little wonderful lives aren't inside."
//This was missing the pronoun. It doesn't look as good without. -GHS
[Taichi]
"They're on furlough! (ULOL)"

[Touko]
"...so typical."

Squeezing,
Touko clasped the candies.

[Taichi]
"If your sugar level levels level should your life expectancy too."

And that triple-use joke should also be forgiven.

[Taichi]
"Even if hunger is missing, it is important to make a habit of putting things in the mouth."

Touko gazed, fixedly, at her fist.

[Touko]
"...you're always like this."
[Touko]
"Pretending to be nice, acting the fool, becoming cold and distant, getting scary."
[Touko]
"I don't get it!"

She covers her face.

[Touko]
"...leave me alone. I'm begging you."

[Taichi]
"Yee-es."

She was angered.
The objective achieved, I leave it as that.

[Taichi]
"Pretending to be nice... then."

She didn't mean it all the way seriously, but it hit the mark.
It was like that with Touko last year, as well.
And then I, of course, like I always do---
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
The Touko Meddling of Kurosu Taichi continued.
Besides me, no one even wanted to approach or talk to her.
It wasn't because of malice,
it was because at Gunjou there also were those who could not construct conversation, and because Touko herself refused it.
//IOW, if humanity is gone, Touko would never see it. -GHS
Everybody's just so sensitive to malice---
//I suspect it means people just attribute things to malice too quickly, which makes sense since it's what Taichi is about to do with his own behavior. -GHS
And then I, something so similar to an entity living by using malice as food,
//Well, that he's deluded of being so. He just saw someone aloof and distant and fell for her, and approached her in the hope of replicating what Misato did to him. This route is so much troll it's unbelievable. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, how about lunch?"

[Touko]
"...don't want it, no."

Poing!
//Not CP because of various reasons and science I suppose. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But... your stomach's rumbling."

[Touko]
"...you shut up, you!"

[Taichi]
"You're so cute when angry. Having a face full of anger suits you, Kirihara."

So I proclaimed in a "You're so cute when smiling. Having a smile suits you, Kirihara"-ish way.
//However, he didn't say it in a youresocutewhenangryhavingafacefullofangersuitsyoukiriharaish way. Wait, he actually did? Uhhhh next sentence. -GHS

[Touko]
"Be silent."

I didn't even have the expectation this would progress further.

[Taichi]
"You don't got a bento. But you're rich!"
//TL Note: bentoは意味不明 -GHS

[Touko]
"...I said I don't want it."
//Likely true, also she can't cook. But isn't it strange? Shouldn't she have people at home ready to make it for her? After all, she'd get one maid by the made or something (engrish is hard). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

I greedily devour my packed lunch in front of those eyes of hers.
//Hum, sandwiches I take it? Maybe he means some stuff from the cafeteria. -GHS
Poing!

[Touko]
"......"

And red was already that face.
//It's still Engrish. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Say now, could it just be that you don't get how the school cafeteria system works?"

Touko had stayed with eyes downcast all along, but eventually she gave a tiny nod.

[Touko]
"...I've always been in a dormitory."

[Taichi]
"Either dormitory or a butler, that's why then."
//Subtle jab. -GHS

[Touko]
"Why do you just have to stand in line when you're simply taking something to eat... incomprehensible!"
//She'll start sounding sort of formal-ish around here. Pre-Taichi Touko doesn't have as much of a potty mouth, it seems. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The way you just blurted out that line all raw's like, whoa."
//Eh, it's the '90s. -GHS

She's no ordinary person: that's what I thought.

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's go, you and me."

I pull her by the hand.

[Touko]
"Eeeh? B-, but is this even fine..."

[Taichi]
"It's fine. I treat pretty girls with kindness."

[Touko]
"A-, again with the kind of dubious sincerity that set my teeth on edge..."
//歯の浮く seems to have the acceptation of something insincere; it seems she understands he's not being quite honest all the way back then, like Misato and Yusa at least. Unlike them, who more or less ignore or forgive (to a point, with Yusa), she'll just delude herself he is because she's desperate. This is already where their relationship falls apart, however, and it's not necessarily Taichi's whole fault. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you open your heart more, Kirihara, I really think your life'll become enjoyable!"
//Sorta vaguely Misatoian this. It's possible that, at this point, Taichi doesn't understand why Misato did what she did. -GHS

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Well, let's go."

[Touko]
"W-, wait up, I say?!"

And in so doing, I created an unilateral connection of sole curiosity.
//And he's nice and delusional as well. -GHS
............
//HACK faster transition. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So I hear you caused problems with the teachers again?"

[Touko]
"...it has nothing to do with you it doesn't."

[Taichi]
"And you don't wear the uniform either."

[Touko]
"I don't accept me having ended up in this school here."

[Taichi]
"Come on, wasn't that the verdict of the Test now?"
//the Test will judge you all. Ku ku ku. -GHS

[Touko]
"That thing..."

[Taichi]
"'Cause there's the possibility that you're someone who hurts people, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"That's something I have never done!"
//Except CCE0001 explicitly says she did. Contradiction? Plot hole? Or was it an accident, sort of an "I'm taking you with me" that went wrong, as with Misato and Tomoki? See CCB2013, maybe that's what that line meant. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I think so as well."

[Touko]
"...huh?"

[Taichi]
"I think so as well."

If anything,
Touko wouldn't do anything but break herself by herself.
//With the problem, again, that it's right. For all her modern tsundere posturing, she never kills anyone - ever! - and her dying is all but a running gag. Now see CCD0022A: Taichi broke himself to be able to kill, he says, but Touko's breaking has more to do with wanting to be with a single person and ignoring all others. -GHS
............
//HACK faster transition. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...do you hate Gunjou, Kirihara?"

[Touko]
"I hate it, that's obvious, yes. Because I'm a decent person after all."
[Touko]
"This place isn't even a joke!"

[Taichi]
"...is it? But I find it fun."
[Taichi]
"It's so comfortable."

[Touko]
"Which part... I'm observed every day... I'm treated like a deviant!"

[Taichi]
"But there's nothing to be scared about here."

[Touko]
"...that is something that has nothing to do with me."

[Taichi]
"Then you hate me, too?"

[Touko]
"Hate very much."
//As sincere as Tomoki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahaha!"

............
//HACK faster transition. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Reeeally... you're always alone aren't you."
//Yup, same line Misato used with him. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Can't make friends, right."

[Touko]
"Do not want them."

[Taichi]
"You will join the Broadcast Club then?"

[Touko]
"...do not want to."
//Hairanai, IOW she's bald. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, but it's fun."

[Touko]
"Why do you even have to invite me, when you have as many others as you like?"

[Taichi]
"Because I prefer you, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"...wh-, why even...!"

[Taichi]
"Because you interest me."

[Touko]
"...bothersome."

I'm likable, I'm harmless, I'm supporting, I'm sociable:
those are the contents of the aura I continue pouring on her.
It is something close to brainwashing.
//Pretty much every time he tries to do this via aura emission, from Kiri in CCA0027 to Yutaka in CCC3004 through Misato in CCD1001, it fails miserably. There's no reason it would work here. It's pure and open chuunin'. -GHS
............
//HACK faster transition. -GHS
Once, Touko asked me a question:

[Touko]
"Kurosu, why are you here?"
//http://www.why-lip.com/ it's only unrelated when ignoring Miki House. ...OK, it's unrelated. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...because my heart is sick."

[Touko]
"But you don't seem like that."
//Remember that she understands him better than he does. He finds his porn stash in like .7 seconds, after all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's in a part that you can't see."

It's in a part that I won't let you see.
Touko holds her head, at wit's end.

[Touko]
"...I've... had enough... of here..."
[Touko]
"It's scary... in this school... I wanna go back..."

Where does she even want to go back to?
Not to her former school or anything of the sort, definitely,
but to those former days of hers, now long past.
//Compare Taichi and his "time loop" Settei. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But it's alright. Once you get used to it, it becomes fun."

[Touko]
"I won't get used to this."

[Taichi]
"You just resolved not to get used to this, right?"
[Taichi]
"You're cute, Kirihara, and because of that if you just get into things here you can life a life as fun as you'd like."

[Touko]
"Do-, does it look like this is what we're talking about!"

[Taichi]
"So cute, sooo cuuute!"

I rub her head.

[Touko]
"...quit it! Really, you dummy!"
//This is still proto-tsundere. -GHS

I'm shaken off.
But if she seriously disliked this, would she really go red all the way to the ears?
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ngh..."

And then I had a dream, a dream of Touko---

[Taichi]
"Zzz..."
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS

I am awake.
Sunlight was piercing through the window.
Seems I have been hard asleep. I did not have any dreams.
The time is... 7AM.
Going to school is necessity.
I try stopping by the classroom.
Touko was here.

[Taichi]
"'morning."

[Touko]
"...(pfuiri)"

[Taichi]
"You look off color there."

[Touko]
"...none of your business, Kurosu."

So blunt.

[Taichi]
"Why did you come to school?"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"Also none of your business."

[Taichi]
"I know why."
[Taichi]
"Because you wanted someone to call out to you."

[Touko]
"...that's not true, no!"

She raised her voice.

[Taichi]
"Therefore I'm calling out to you."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"What are you talking about... that's just what you decided to think, Kurosu, yes it is!"

[Taichi]
"It's the second day, right? You're gonna die on water alone."
//She's not gonna die on four days of not eating, however. And she isn't even drinking. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I'll give you this."

I tender over a Youkobento.
//It's a distant cousin of the Tomoki-bako. -GHS

[Touko]
"What's this, even?"

[Taichi]
"It's not panties and it's not a bottle of Wonderful Lives, definitely."
//See CCD0014A, CCA0026 (first instance) -GHS

[Touko]
"...far too untrustworthy."
[Touko]
"You really don't ever think of anything but semen."

[Taichi]
"That's a preposterous overstatement!"
//I think he's thought about tits once or twice. But laterally, if his Ebul Monster is just his dick, she might not be incorrect about it being specifically semen. -GHS

How shocking!

[Taichi]
"It's food."
[Taichi]
"There's sandwiches and Anman inside."
[Taichi]
"...and the Anman was baked in a Seiro steamer, of course."
//See CCA0014A, though it's sort of a running gag at this point. Term googles, mercifully. -GHS

[Touko]
"Don't want it... don't need it."

[Taichi]
"Yeah you need it. Eat!"

Slid over,
I thrust an Anman at her.

[Touko]
"...stop this."
//But the sound file is inexplicably new. -GHS

A violent swat of her hands.
//HACK SFX -GHS
The Anman fell,
recovered.
I pluck the skin off the part that caught dust, and ate it myself.
And once again I hold one to her.

[Touko]
"You..."

Certain Kill Technique * The Enemy of Her Entire Family Yet Making Her Into a Pupil.
//See CCA0005A. The kanji used was different, but it seems just a minor terminology inconsistency, the meaning seems the same. Special Move nau. Interesting compared to Miki being her pupil, and how. -GHS
With Touko as opponent, victory should be easy.

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Touko]
"...ah..."

She took it.
Anman in hand, she stares vacant at me.

[Taichi]
"Having no human alive, none outside of you, that worry about you... it's painful, right?"

[Touko]
"What's that even mean I don't know."

[Taichi]
"You want people to worry about you."
[Taichi]
"You want to be fulfilled."

[Touko]
"..."

She goes silent.

[Taichi]
"And me, I'm getting somewhat worried here."

She sternly glares at me.

[Touko]
"Look... who's talking."
[Touko]
"If you're worried, then why, why!"

She loses her temper.

[Taichi]
"Ah, but I wasn't thinking of making you angry or anything right now."

Smaaack.
Staggering.
That did not hurt in the slightest.

[Touko]
"...ngh..."

Right after this strike, Touko collapses sitting on to the floor.

[Taichi]
"You OK?"

[Touko]
"...nh..."

Holding her eyes shut, her face almost colorless.

[Taichi]
"...Touko."

I crouch next to her.

[Touko]
"Don't address me without honorifics, you..."

So she says as if squeezing it out.

[Taichi]
"Armistice, OK? This is a state of emergency."

[Touko]
"My eyes, I can't see..."

[Taichi]
"You're alright. It's just that blood circulation has deteriorated."

[Touko]
"I feel nauseous... like to throw up."

[Taichi]
"Want to throw up?"

[Touko]
"...no!"

[Taichi]
"Get on your side now, come on."

Lap pillow.

[Touko]
"Nh... head's spinning round... it's like I got dizzy from standing up too fast..."

[Taichi]
"Looks like you'll be seeing soon."
//Har? -GHS

[Touko]
"How do you even know, you don't know anything about medicine!"
//See CCA0002. How would she know he doesn't know when she doesn't even know trivia-level stuff like neurons not replicating? -GHS

[Taichi]
"I know about you, Touko."

[Touko]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"Seems like you're seeing again."

[Touko]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"It's anemia. Sometimes it does things like that."

[Touko]
"A bit... better I think..."

[Taichi]
"Open your mouth."

[Touko]
"You'll put something weird in it, no and no."

[Taichi]
"It's water. Unmixed water at that."
//Pure water's technically distilled water... not that it matters. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I'm just making you drink."
//NOT SUSPICIOUS. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

She opened her mouth.
Pour.

[Touko]
"Whtpft?!"
//Not the same Taichi uses in CCB2014 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry."

[Touko]
"It's fine, I can drink myself! Give it over now!"
[Touko]
"nGhnGhnGh..."

Drinking in the style of a Department Deputy Director who's in that midway position where the hardships are neverending, Touko emptied its contents.
//Fooorced. See CCC0006B -GHS
Her stomach was stimulated, maybe.
Poing!
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"...that now... you misheard that."

[Taichi]
"Knew it."
[Taichi]
"Knew it, therefore you gotta eat food."

[Touko]
"......"

She simply went red in the face.
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
This was shortly after Touko attained the social status of someone capable of eating lunch.
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"...I'll stand in line today."

That's what she just blurted out.
She had gotten used to the cafeteria,
but Touko was always hiding herself behind my back.
Because there's plenty of weird people here.
I did everything up until carrying the trays.
Touko's job was to take the seats,
//SIMPLE2000シリーズ Vol.78 THE座席とり -GHS
but even that she did half-scared.

[Taichi]
"You? Standing in line?"

[Touko]
"...I'm always making you stand in line so... from today on I will line up too."

She headed to the counter, meal ticket in hand.

[Taichi]
"Oh dear me..."
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
HACK different transition back -GHS

[Touko]
"...it's all dry."

[Taichi]
"They're this morning's."

[Touko]
"It's too big and hard to eat."

[Taichi]
"It was made for me."

[Touko]
"There's way too much mustard."

[Taichi]
"I really like 'em harsh and spicy."

[Touko]
"......"
//That non-voiced line is overtagged as already recorded. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, is it bad?"

[Touko]
"......delicious."

[Taichi]
"Well then, eat it slowly."

[Touko]
"Sob."

She was sniffling.

[Taichi]
"Slowly, 'k, otherwise your stomach won't accept it."
[Taichi]
"There's just one more Anman, want it?"

[Touko]
"...want it."

[Taichi]
"The food was prepared for you by the people at your residence, right?"

[Touko]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"And if they're gone, what will you do?"
//Specific. Heh. -GHS

[Touko]
"Nothing whatsoever. Nothing shows up, that's it."
//Given it's a Rich Girl Gag, that she'd expect stuff to just 'turn up' seems more appropriate. As for no one being there, read closely: it's a conditional. Of course if they'd all be gone there wouldn't be any food anymore. And since she's terrified that everyone would leave her, including the staff, she takes the question seriously. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And since you're so incapable of cooking, Touko, that sits side by side with death."

[Touko]
"...how do you... know that I can't cook...?"

[Taichi]
"Don't think about it."

[Touko]
"I do think about it..."

[Taichi]
"How do you feel?"

[Touko]
"I feel better... just a little."

[Taichi]
"If you get hungry, come 'round to my house."
[Taichi]
"I don't have caviar, but if you wanna some potatoes I do have some."

[Touko]
"......but."

I knew what she wanted to say.
She fears betrayal.
//See Tomoki, Kiri... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...but, more importantly."
[Taichi]
"What do you think annihilated humanity?"

I look outside the window.
It wasn't a question I expected an answer for.

[Touko]
"This isn't annihilation, no."
[Touko]
"...there was no one from the beginning."
//Where would she have learned this reference to it being an alternate world? Her "no one" is closer to Kiri's rant in CCC3007, and far more metaphorical than it seems. -GHS
[Touko]
"If I think that, I don't get angry."
//Well lookee here. -GHS
[Touko]
"Or disappointed either."

[Taichi]
"Was that the same reason you were ignoring me?"
//HACK earlier doll -GHS

I turned my sight to her direction.
//From looking out the window -GHS
The axle of Touko's gaze shifted off of mine.
//Good ol' recurring term. -GHS

[Touko]
"...it was."
[Touko]
"And still, you came close and talked to me... you're insane. And you know that dammit!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

[Touko]
"Whyyy are you apologizing!"
[Touko]
"I don't understand you Taichi... not at all..."

And time kept passing,
//Swap around -GHS
with sorrowful anguish.
//HACK zoom garden, remove the Taichi bedroom. Maybe intended to replicate CCB2002 closer. -GHS
To the garden, bearing potatoes.
Using a survival manga as reference, I set up a cooking fire.

[Taichi]
"Done..."

Steaming is too much of a mess, so I settled for roasting.
Potatoes for two.
Wait.
A person collapsed at the front door.
//HACK fading instead -GHS
It's Kirihara Touko.

[Touko]
"Ngggh..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I shoulder Touko,

[Touko]
"...Ta-, Taichi...?"

carry her with,

[Touko]
"Ah-, auh..."

make her sit,
and insert a potato in her mouth.

[Touko]
"uGnnn, uMhMhMhMhMhMh?!"
[Touko]
"I can eat by myself!!!"

Potato leftovers flew out of her mouth as she shouted.
Greedily, greedily, greedily.

[Taichi]
"Here ma'am, salt."

[Touko]
"Put some."

[Taichi]
"...yes ma'am."
//Unfortunately the two terms don't really gel in English. -GHS

Touko was eating for dear life.

[Touko]
"...mnch."

Limbs stiffen.
All according to my calculations (not that I did any).
//You can date some scripts (or at least the revisions) down to the month by looking at when Melty Blood came out. Using the typical translation. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Here, water."

I hand over a bottle of water.

[Touko]
"GlpGlpGlp..."

She chugs down.

[Touko]
"MnchMnch."

She wolfs down once again.
After having flattened seven or eight, finally Touko takes a breather.
//HACK music out earlier -GHS

[Touko]
"...I've calmed down now."

[Taichi]
"Welll, that's what's important."
//HACK No need -GHS

Touko readjusts her sitting position.

[Touko]
"...a most delicious meal."

[Taichi]
"Oh yep."

[Touko]
"And also... th-, thanks."

Awkwardly.

[Taichi]
"More importantly, look at this."

[Touko]
"What's this?"

[Taichi]
"It's called 'canned food'."
//See CCB2002 -GHS

[Touko]
"Ohhh."

[Taichi]
"You open it, and there's food inside. There's wet preserved food, see."
//Doesn't seem anything specific, just a sorta-awkward contrast to dry preserved food. -GHS

[Touko]
"...ahhh, I see."
[Touko]
"Where do they sell this?"

[Taichi]
"Kombini and the like."
//Kombini have nothing to do with combinations! That's already the worst, I won't forgive such things etc! -GHS

[Touko]
"Kombini...?"

[Taichi]
"You don't even know about Kombini?!"
//HACK angrier -GHS

[Touko]
"I-, I do know, you... just that I have never seen one, that's it."
//HACK to black -GHS

[Taichi]
"BNNNKKK!!!"

I reached the peak.
Tumbling down.
//HACK no need -GHS

[Touko]
"Kyaaah?! Wh-what happened?"
//HACK back, with doll -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your Rich SOB rate surpasses 98%!"
//9+8=17=1+7=8 -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh... does it, I wonder... but I do not get it, no...?"
//Rich girl accent. Waaay strong, too. Likely joke. -GHS
[Touko]
"Besides, talking about money at this point..."
//After he rejected her and all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, that's true, yes."
[Taichi]
"Awww man, if only I had become son-in-law to your family at that time."
//See CCA0022, CCC3012B -GHS

I'm in a huff!

[Touko]
"...ulterior motives sooo impure..."

[Taichi]
"After all, you tried to introduce me to your parents all stealth-like dinn'cha."

[Touko]
"...I did but... you ran away, Taichi."
//See CCC4015. This is odd, isn't it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"See here, Touko,"
[Taichi]
"I'm the #1 Most Wanted Criminal in the Gunjou Institute you know."
[Taichi]
"If you introduced someone like that to your parents... there's no way your Godfather would have ever allowed this, right?"
//This is a load of bullshit. She became too clingy, and combined with his complete failure of understanding her plus his constant self-eviscerating games made him push her away. -GHS

[Touko]
"...you are not some weirdo, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"If that kind of line comes out of you, then you got a long, looong way to go."
//Technically true. He is a weirdo. Not the kind he thinks, tho. See CCX0001, when "she" says that line to "Sakuraba" -GHS
[Taichi]
"You've got a long way to go before getting rid of your Mongolian Spot."
//It googles. -GHS

[Touko]
"That, you said that before as well."
//Probably not the Mongolian spot thing... -GHS
[Touko]
"But I didn't understand it and I still don't understand... because I'm... a dummy..."
[Touko]
"Getting treated with gentleness, nothing more, that's what I wish..."
//See YMK/Aeka: "Me, as long as there's that, it's enough. Just being treated so very gently...". But unlike Aeka, who's sincere, Touko's as sincere as Taichi here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

[Touko]
"...this has become so annoying. All this big effort needed just to live normally."

[Taichi]
"So, Kirihara, you can't live alone then."

[Touko]
"...'ddap."

[Taichi]
"Damn automatic people..."

[Touko]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"...me staying here, can't I?"

[Taichi]
"It's OK."

[Touko]
"...right... wait, what? I-, it's OK?"

[Taichi]
"It's OK."

[Touko]
"Ah, uhm, I'm just going to bring back a change of clothes!"

[Taichi]
"We have clothespiiins, so there's no need to bring theeem!"
//See CCB2003A, they're for her nose. -GHS

[Touko]
"...mnghmnkh?!"
//HACK stay on black half a second at least willya -GHS

She went and quickly returned,
and bringing a bag so filled that it was nearly about to burst.
Knees ready to give, drenched in sweat.
You've been so sheltered you likely own nothing more than your chopsticks, I recall teasing her.
//Adapted. -GHS
And then this female replies, 'I use knife and fork!'. With a serious face.

[Taichi]
"Come on now..."

[Touko]
"Th-, there's so way too much that on my own---"

She makes an explanation with eyes open wide, peppered with flapping gesticulation.
//See CCA0021, CCA0030. So very Misato. -GHS
This part of her is indeed adorable.
//And it being Misato-ish is probably why. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow I want to use the car."

[Touko]
"And the license?"

[Taichi]
"Do you even need it here?"
//Key word: here. Of course it can be read to mean "with things like this", but, as usual... -GHS

[Touko]
"Ah, right..."
[Touko]
"First of all, since I brought over a minimum of changes of clothes, I will be lodging here starting tonight."

[Taichi]
"Same room's no good I presume?"
//HACK fade the doll -GHS

[Touko]
"I would prefer same room..."

[Taichi]
"Don't whine that it's cramped then."

[Touko]
"...I would prefer it cramped... it's more intimate..."
//I'm not putting "I would prefer it small" here. -GHSevenYearsOld

[Taichi]
"Eh...?"

[Touko]
"It-, it's nothing..."

The tip of her nose dyes red (maybe, it's dark and I can't see well), and Touko faces away.
//Spectacular night vision. -GHS
Damn it all, what a coquette.
But howevermuch adult alluring power we have, I shall deal with it with calm composure!

[Taichi]
"Th-th-th-th-th-then, sh-SHO-sh-sh-should we sleep wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-with nothing done?"
//See CCA0008. That's 5xさ + 3xす (just the ones in hiragana, of course)=8, and 7xね. -GHS

Whooooaaaa!
Cut it out you, calm down me!

[Touko]
"Ah, uhm..."

[Taichi]
"Hm? Yes? What?"

[Touko]
"I would like to take a bath."
//You can use 使う a bath instead of entering them 入れる??? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS PERVERSION JAPAN -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, let's say there's drawn water in the tub, but... you'll have to just splash yourself."
//The terms seem to mean that there's not enough water in the tub to soak, she'll have to use a pan or a bucket to actually wash herself. See CCB2009; he doesn't propose it there, but perhaps he just thought she expected a full soaking rather than being a possible plot hole. -GHS

It's precious water of course, but in a life paced around a single week I couldn't care less about conservation.

[Touko]
"That's fine, I'll be borrowing it, yes."

[Taichi]
"...sure."

I sit seiza on top of the bed, thinking.
This can't go.
She's sooo willing to do this.
She's so easy to understand.
So excessively cute that's she simple.
An uncreased, unexpectant heart.
//Lit. 'flat'. Did he also make a tsurupetta joke...? -GHS
Because she's pure, then doing that... would be possible, yes.
So difficult.
What do ought I do?
...the answer can be... only one.
Yes.
For the sake of Touko being Touko.
In that sense, we ought not be living together.
But... that's something I want as well... just a tiny little bit.
To obtain something wholesome, then,
that is what these days are about. It is a holy war.
//Oh yes. -GHS

[Touko]
"Taichi..."

She returned.

[Taichi]
"Touko..."
//~THE END Hideo Kojima's Cross Channel~ -GHS

[Touko]
"...I have made myself all clean, now..."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

Embraced on what it feels like the instant I stood up.
So quick. Also, dangerous.
Once upon a time, in a nearby apartment there dwelled a famed Syrupple, who would keep splitting apart, and then getting back together and back again.
//See CCB2005. Hum, but there's no apartment complexes around him as far as the map seems to hint (not that it's very clear) (not that it's relevant) -GHS
They would quarrel loud enough their screams would spread in the neighborhood, and then they would reconcile in the blink of an eye.
...unbelievable I would ever end up like that.
//Paraphrasis: Aw, They Do Love Each Other. -GHS
And then, Touko said "I have made myself all clean" to my face, all embarrassed.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, so you have."

I direct my very best smile at her.

[Taichi]
"Then, here."

I handed over a sleeping bag.

[Touko]
"............what's this tube?"

It's rolled up and stored in its own sheath, therefore it's cylindrical.

[Taichi]
"You likely don't know, so, this is a special bag for sleeping called a sleeping bag."
//So he said, sleepingbagly. -GHS

A "?" mark leaped up above Touko's head.
//told you, it's fucking metal gears -GHS

[Touko]
"Why do I have to sleep inside a bag?"

[Taichi]
"Because women are not mere bags for men to use."

[Touko]
"...that's difficult, you know, I don't really get it."

She works hard not to get it.

[Taichi]
"Using this, even the floor will not be too painful. Awesome, right, Touko!"
//Hum, shouldn't it be worse than the futon? -GHS

[Touko]
"Isn't there a bed over there..."

[Taichi]
"This is mine."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

Glare-off.
//Kansai-ben. -GHS

[Touko]
"The level of incomprehensibility is getting higher, yes..."

[Taichi]
"I said you'd be lodging, there were no promises outside of that."
[Taichi]
"Well g'niiight."

I sunk my body in the soft bed,
because in the dark, outside of sleep, there is nothing to do.

[Touko]
"Eh, wait... we still haven't... done anything..."

[Taichi]
"Zzz."

[Touko]
"Re-, reallyyy..."

[Taichi]
"Zzz."

[Touko]
"Stupid stupid stupid! Stupid Taichi!"

[Taichi]
"Zzz."
//HACK to sky instead -GHS

Rustle, rustle.
Sounds of the sleeping bag being spread,
sounds of a body sliding inside it.

[Touko]
"Ugggh... floor, hurts..."

Grumbling and discontent.

[Touko]
"......"
[Touko]
"So hot! I can't be inside this thing in Summertime!"
//That would be her clothes, too. -GHS
[Touko]
"Oh whatever, I'll just sleep on top of it..."
[Touko]
"...sob... so hard, hurts..."

The sorrowful anguished laments continued until she fell asleep.

[Taichi]
"...shut yer damn trap if you please..."
//Urusee-desu -GHS

Until Touko had fallen asleep, I could not sleep myself.
And yet still,
I extended my hands to the corners of those eyes, and gently wiped away her tears.
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS
I wake up to Touko still sleeping on the floor.
With anguish on her face.

[Touko]
"...ngggh..."

Poor thing.
She might have had a bad dream, who knows.
Anyhow, I changed clothes and headed to school.
A gate to prevent desertion.
It seems to exist less to protect students, and more to protect the outside world from us.
That is the impression it left.
Like those hooligans of old, I sit at my seat while crossing my legs over the desk,
tilting the chair slowly, back and forth.
There is nothing to do. Truly free time indeed.

[Touko]
"Taichi..."

Touko came in, uncharacteristically late,
and with shortness of breath.

[Taichi]
"Oh, late aren't we."

[Touko]
"...looked for you... everywhere..."

[Taichi]
"I see, that's why you are late then."
[Taichi]
"Daaawd-ler, daaawd-ler!"
//HACK earlier doll -GHS

I pick on her, so she looks angry.
Nah, it's likely that even if I hadn't picked on her it'd have been the same.

[Touko]
"Whyyy did you go on alone! Whyyy didn't you wake me up?!"

[Taichi]
"Because you were asleep."

[Touko]
"Then wake me up!"

[Taichi]
"...(pondering)"
[Taichi]
"Sorry, I didn't realize."

Touko falls to her knees.
//See CCD0023 - heh. -GHS

[Touko]
"...really... it's to cry..."
//What a nice Taichism. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Crybaby ain'tcha."
//See CCA0010. What he wanted was to be Misato to her Taichi. -GHS
[Taichi]
"More importantly, let's scrounge up all kinds of eatery and eat, I hunger."

[Touko]
"...huuuh..."

And after, that the two of us searched for all sorts of eatery.
In the houses nearby, in the shops,
questing for food.
//They're totally knocking on doors and asking for something to eat. -GHS
Touko looked discouragedly disappointed. All throughout.
Having avoided raw food, we have acquired only packaged foodstuff and drinks.
//Some folks are totally tossing produce at the two damn thieves, aren't they. -GHS
And then, having to explain one by one every detail to Touko who was ignorant even of the concept of retort pouch took a lot of time.
But in the end, when it came for the two of us were having our meager lunch, she had regained cheer.
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS

[Touko]
"...Kurosu, I say, it seems you have plenty lady-friends."
//Again with more formal past Touko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh? What's this all of a sudden?"

[Touko]
"Because, today I was walking in front of the club room, and you were making this big commotion with so many others."
//It could be that's his meeting with Kiri, see CCB0006, but below hints it might not be. She knows where it is, but wasn't going there so it shouldn't be CCD3003. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, riiight."

[Touko]
"You're the popular one."

That was just the normal commotion.
//May be downplaying the Kiri incident, may mean it's another thing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...what are you getting your panties in a twist for?"
//Lit. "twist your bellybutton". Surprisingly close... -GHS

[Touko]
"They're not twisting at all!"
//...but the point seems to be that she doesn't get it. And it's another reference to panties just for knicks. -GHS

She got angry.

[Taichi]
"They're more club colleagues of mine than just friends... there's men too, you know?"

[Touko]
"Did not see any..."
//It's more and more likely it isn't the Kiri thing, since Tomoki was up front there. ...not that she wouldn't have ignored him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"There's more than one, of course. But, you know, if I really had the popular popularity that you say, wouldn't you think I'd have at least one girlfriend?"
//人気者でモテてたら ick. All of two men, in fact. Dishonesty doesn't have to be through blatant lies, though that's a lesson that should've been clear many routes ago. -GHS

[Touko]
"S-, so you don't have one..."
//This was the point of her roundabout question, which Taichi might not even have guessed... -GHS

[Taichi]
"If I did, I wouldn't be all close talking to you like this, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"............eh?"

My invasion steadily progressed.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
HACK different transition back -GHS
We passed the afternoon in the club room,
as the ventilation is good, and it's cooler than the classroom.
//It toootally doesn't mean that they can talk in the club room easier than in class since the classes are still in session as normal and they're just cutting. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Do you remember?"

[Touko]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"All the troubles I had to go through to get you to come play with us in the club room, Touko."
//Going with 'play' in the literal sense, not in the lateral 'come by for non-serious purposes'. -GHS

[Touko]
"......"
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS

And so she had ended up coming to club every once in a while.

[Taichi]
"...yo, you came."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"Because I was bored, and this is only me showing face."

[Taichi]
"You only come when there's nobody, Kirihara."
//Hmmm. -GHS

[Touko]
"...a coincidence!"

[Taichi]
"Well, have a seat. I'm a treating you to some crappy coffee."

[Touko]
"...yes."
//HACK dim screen, dots replaced by this I guess. -GHS

It was an experiment.
//Troll Channel is in session! -GHS
By what extent could the human that I am carry himself through society via the application of good manners?
//Don't fall asleep now: "how well can I do in the world if I behave myself as expect?" What kind of Evil Experiment is this?! -GHS
By what extent could I continue my deception?
//Considering it's been ten years since release straight with no one apparently noticing, I'd say for a veeeeery looooooong time. -GHS
And depending on the results, I would decide in what way I can live.
//Since the result is "I picked the wrong girl dammit", it would seem things are inconclusive. More interesting is the "experiment" he's running on Yusa, more or less parallel to this. That one he explicitly says it's about his looks. Paradoxically, the first week was more honest than this! -GHS
Could I blend in?
Could I imitate emotional bonds like sympathy?
What is the possibility of my existence?
//生存は可なのか + 人 = 生存は何なのか (what is the meaning of my existence) ...symbolism? -GHS
And to accomplish all this, an extent of power is necessary to manipulate people at will.
Because I am heterogeneous.
//And if you follow this term allll the way to the start, you'll see he means his looks. See CCA0022, especially. -GHS
To not cause fright is a must.
To not have my unsightliness perceived is a must.
//And there it is. Further compare Yusa, esp. see CCA0013. He's talking about his looks but thinking he's talking about inside when he actually does think it's his looks. Apparent deception!=real (self-)deception!=truth=apparent deception. -GHS
This underlying ugliness of mine has a direct connection to my image of the witch.
//Hence all the witches in Umineko? More importantly, remember all the sandwiches that Youko makes. That joke about the witches now has payoff... mostly because he ties an *underlying* ugliness to an *image*. The poor bastard. Also, remember who's the Mountain Witch. -GHS
The origin... childhood fairytales or something I guess?
//Who reads "albino" and thinks "witch"? ...more people than read "locked door mystery" and think "witch", I guess, but... -GHS
Maybe I had read in a book that the history of witch hunts was extremely vicious, and it's possible I have ended up having embraced the prejudice that witches are indeed truly wicked, or something of the sort.
//Who actually ever reads about the fierceness of the witch hunts and thinks maybe they were correct? Especially considering most of that fierceness is entirely the invention of 17th century anti-Catholic and anti-Christian propaganda! This is a strangely odd conclusion consistent with CCA0015C, and laterally with the Phantasy Star II reference. I'm considering this as another tongue-in-cheek side-reference to Christianity that looks chastising only to the untrained eye, like making the local prophet a zombie or having characters scream "goddamn" and "Jesus" in English. -GHS
And then the white hair, as well looks so characteristically diabolic.
//In Japan maybe, in the West white hair is nowhere near as close as horns or a tail, let alone red hair. More interestingly, that'd make Taichi a White Witch. So he has a belly bug who's a lion, and there's porn in his wardrobe... hmmm. -GHS
The glittering of these pupils, same.
There's no limit to things to be anxious about.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"Here Touko, this one's yours."

I handed over the coffee.
Calling it crappy then serving Blue Mountain coffee is an art.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_Blue_Mountain_Coffee the coffee seems largely irrelevant except perhaps to recalling the mountains which separate the real world from Heaven; laterally, calling this sci-fi about psychopaths stuck in an alternate dimension and then being a meta mess about religion is very much an art, to say nothing of the simpler and hopefully by now more obvious metareferences here. -GHS

[Touko]
"...say."

[Tacihi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"What if I called you 'Taichi'."
//That's his name, don't wear it out -GHS

I was bit astonished.
For the first time I felt Touko had deviated. Deviated from my cognition of her.
//And there's the first serious hint about who's really in control here. And more evidence of the major reading key of Cross Channel: Taichi's people reading skills are incredibly bad, and this goes double for himself. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...no problem. But it's sudden, innit."

[Touko]
"Buuut only me being called 'Touko, Touko', is that mayhap not unequal!"
//HACK fufufu -GHS
[Touko]
"Therefore retaliation."

A cattish broad grin of a smile.

[Taichi]
"...please, feel free to."

I showed her a bitter smile.
//He's so owned. -GHS
............
//HACK faster transition -GHS

[Taichi]
"What's this?"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"...a-, it's a packed lunch... made by me, yes."
//Sorta confused. See CCB2002, she's lying to get in his good graces. Which is the exact thing he's doing, except he's incessantly wangsty about it. Ain't cross communication wonderful. That her first big lie is about food should further recall Yusa and Yusa's mom. In this sense, Taichi also rejects Touko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, you're even capable of making something as plebeian as this then!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"Of course! I might seem like this but I am excellent at cooking."
//As in a rich, wealthy incompetent. Which she is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Isn't there a bit too much stuff?"
//See Touko. I mean, Youko. -GHS

[Touko]
"...yes, right... I made too much... therefore, Taichi, you may exceptionally be entrusted with partaking of this, yes!"
//Tsundere levels increasing. Curiously, this seems to be partly a learned behavior. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, right..."

Astonishment that left a bitter taste on my mouth.
//This one I've usually translated as disgusted, but here there's more of the astonishment. Splitting the difference. -GHS

[Touko]
"...delicious?"
//Yes, I have personally witnessed human beings actually ask this question like this, no frills. Then again, I've personally witnessed human beings claim "is like a character, acts" and "acts like a character" are substantially rather than irrelevantly different, so maybe they're not the best example. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, respectably tasty."

[Touko]
"Th-, those... fried eggs, how are they?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno, these are the only ones that are all crooked... the rest are so square'n'straight though."

[Touko]
"Ngh..."

I see.
From the reaction guess the truth, and select a suitable conduct.
//See CCB2002: his bad reaction may not be so much at her being unable to cook, but at the age of the maid who made it. Regardless, they haven't had sex yet and their relationship is already a train wreck of lies. The one thing that should be obvious, however, is this: in what way is this an abnormal, absurd or impossible way for relationships to go wrong among perfectly ordinary people? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mh... aaah, but these are the most delicious!"

[Touko]
"REALLY?!"

[Taichi]
"Yup. Really, delicious."
[Taichi]
"I can just feel the emotions that were put in this. Yes, tasty tasty!"

Truth is, they were the most disgusting.
It's exactly as this looked like.
Those were days of repeated politeness.
//That repetition... -GHS
............
//HACK flashback exit whiteout, and stop the damn cicadas! -GHS
HACK different transition back -GHS
Half a day had passed by.
Hours of casual nonchalance,
hours of silly foolishness.
//See CCA0030. -GHS
That means they are worthless, right?
Never.
Someday, I will think back upon these sham-like hours spent at school with Touko, for sure.
//He already does... -GHS

[Touko]
"So, we're going home together now... you promised right?"

She said that as things reached the Should We Go Home stage.
//Hum, is he still acting according to a suspiciously dating sim-like schedule...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yup, no problem, nooo problem."
//HACK off doll -GHS

I have my aim set on a car.

[Taichi]
"Kuh kuh kuh!"
//TL Note: (evil laugh) -GHS

Today I will help myself to the Headmaster's Ferrari.
The key I've made to take a rude leave from the Headmaster's Office.
//Once again he uses a term that can mean he just took it, but also that he just stole it. -GHS
Certainly I had no talent for driving, but,
in its stead, I am ever overflowing with the talent of effort and age.
//才 -GHS
In the days of this repeating one week I have come into contact with cars time after time, and mastered them.
//The way he puts this should remind of how many times he's touched people and, by parallel, how much he's mastered handling that... -GHS
And now, that ability is at Formula levels(?), assuredly.
//F1 driving levels, confirmed by the author. Of course, by "came in contact with cars" he seems to mean "I read up about my previous disasters". -GHS
VroomVroomVroom!

[Taichi]
"Well, let's go."
//HA-- nope, it's all set properly. -GHS

[Touko]
"So driver-like, heh."
//Sort of like "so like having a driver". -GHS

She boards into the passenger seat.
//HACK and out -GHS

[Taichi]
"Fasten your seatbelt, please."

[Touko]
"...yes, of course..."

[Taichi]
"Then FORWARDS!"

............

[Touko]
"...never... driving with you again, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"I'm of the same opinion."
//And see CCB2008 for both. -GHS

I didn't grow skilled all easy-peasy, nope.
Also I got the Ferrari some serious damage.

[Taichi]
"Besides, it's hard to drive. Leave the steering wheel and it twitches immediately, the clutch's heavy so it's hard to shift into gear... and then when you downshift after slowing down there's this weird shaking... is it just defective?"
//SOMEONE tried and failed to drive one. And the way he's using those terms seems incorrect. -GHS

Maybe this is just talentlessness... mine.
Anyway, treating cars as disposable is not exactly a big problem.
//See CCC0011C: who's the Headmaster even going to get damages from? The host family, who is likely paid by the State? Taichi's right, the idiot should've simply not F'd to school. -GHS
We head to Touko's mansion.
//It's a very quick and nearly straight drive from Gunjou. He couldn't even get it out of the parking lot, could he... -GHS
............
//HACK earlier doll -GHS

[Touko]
"For the baggages, I was wondering, oh what should I bring with, so I went searching all over."
[Touko]
"And guess whose old photos turned up?"

She says that looking happy.

[Touko]
"So glad I didn't throw them away... I'm thinking of sticking them to a wall."
[Touko]
"Until the wall is all buried in them!"

[Taichi]
"Ohhh."

[Touko]
"Heh heh!"

She linked her arm with mine.
I extracted that [ITEM] from the tools bag and equipped it.

[Taichi]
"Look at this, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"An arm band?"

The young lady looks quite closely.

[Touko]
"...syrupples... ostracized..."
[Touko]
"Syrupples ostracized."

So finally reads Touko.

[Taichi]
"Indeed. I have gravely seen the enormity of the impact of Syrupples on the environment, and with manners most firm, I now strive for the position to regulate and furthermore curb said impact."
[Taichi]
"Cease this arm linking!"

I shake her off.

[Touko]
"It-, it's always like this I know but... what are you even saying, I don't understand."

[Taichi]
"One ought to be most discreet in immersive displays of affections in front of people."

[Touko]
"People, but there's no more..."

[Taichi]
"There's still a few."

[Touko]
"Ngggh..."

Appears to be frustrated.
//Minor change. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, you are the reversible model of overcompetitive girl, and this is fine."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"But if you get this sweet, you'll also be far too hackneyed! There's too much dampness! Let's be more consistently unyielding! Select carefully when to show shyness. Someone like that is moe... be that, Kirihara!

[Touko]
"Huh, huuuh..."

[Taichi]
"You are a woman so like a precious gem."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh! (flutter~)"

[Taichi]
"That brilliance surpasses that of a diamond... but alas, a diamond is but carbon, and when thrown in a fire it burns all the way. Goddamn it. The stupidity of storing all the fortune accumulated in a lifetime in something diamond-like I have learned well."

[Touko]
"???"

[Taichi]
"You have shortcomings and strong points. This is what this one would like to have you understand, oh my fair lady."

[Touko]
"I don't really get it but, I get it, yes."

[Taichi]
"So you got it now?"

[Touko]
"...Taichi, you're embarrassed. Of being all sticky-sticky in front of people that is."

[Taichi]
"E'hy!"

Panties takedown.
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Touko]
"Misconduuuct!"

[Taichi]
"Misconduuuct."
//I don't think it's about murdering a government official, plus why is that a bad thing really Japan -GHS

For the return home we went and used the Kiriharas' huge RV.
//And Touko doesn't complain despite five seconds ago???? Continuity? -GHS
We had an accident on the way.
There were still several hundred meters of distance to my house.
From there, by random chance, I had already obtained the key to a car parked in the vicinity.
//He procured the key because he KNEW he would crash the RV there. But how did he know that, given the Formula Level thing above? -GHS

[Touko]
"...wow... so well prepared..."

[Taichi]
"Unwillingly so."
//See 'bove. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Ahhh!!! So tireeed!!!"

[Touko]
"...thank you. For everything you've done for me."

[Taichi]
"It's okeeey."

[Touko]
"Shall we take a cold water bath... together?"

[Taichi]
"As long as there's no Ecchi."
//(tm) (C) -GHS

[Touko]

She's expressionless, yet what emotion could be swirling into an eddy under there?
//See Youko now. -GHS

[Touko]
"I will go on in ahead."

[Taichi]
"Habe phuuuun!"
//Not quite what Yusa's mother said, but hum, it's the second time now. -GHS

So then now.
I rummage in the luggage.
Harakiri Blade discovered,
brought to the garden,
and broken off.
In its place, I equip a carnation.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianthus_caryophyllus#Symbolism This works in the Player Changing Party Member Equipment sense. -GHS
Flowers are a symbol of peace, yes.
//But not the carnation, as seen above. -GHS

[Touko]
"...so refreshing!"

[Taichi]
"Yup, that was refreshing wasn't it."

[Touko]
"But right now I have made myself all clean... well?"

[Taichi]
"And there it is..."

A much more straightforward approach than yesterday.
That's why she's the Syrupple Skill Record Holder...

[Touko]
"But, truth is, I can't endure anymore you know? Taichi, let's have sex already."
//HACK the joke below was lame and was slightly tweaked. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I have suddenly become Impo."
//He went Sakuraba now, meaning he's doing the right thing since Sakuraba knows everything(tm). -GHS

[Touko]
"......impo?"

[Taichi]
"It's the abbreviation of a certain German word. It's strong evidence that a man can't do the pervy stuff. You'll work yourself to the proper etymology later."

[Touko]
"Do you hate me?"

[Taichi]
"I love you beyond reason."

[Touko]
"Well then why!"

[Taichi]
"Because I love you."

[Touko]
"???"

Or should I say, once I put my hands on her it's curtains.
It's necessary to steadfastly continue enduring here.

[Touko]
"...whatever. I will sleep straight after beauty care."

Is that skin beauty care?
My interest was piqued.

[Taichi]
"I knew it, that part of you is so very girlish!"
[Taichi]
"Girlishness is something to be cherished and---"

She began beauty care for her sword.

[Taichi]
"...nope."

[Touko]
"Now then."

The profound peacefulness of my denunciation did not reach her.
Sliiide,

//But as the above shows, their relationship was doomed. And it's not Taichi faking - it's both. -GHS

Experiment successful.
Or so I thought.

[Taichi]
"Blood gathers there, that's why."
[Taichi]
"It's fine if you do it harder."

[Touko]
"...ah... aah..."

[Taichi]
"Grasp it sort of like this, and then move up and down with this strength---"

One by one I taught her.
I filthied her.
//He's having sex with his girlfriend so he Filthies. He's just so eeemo. See CCC0000 again. -GHS
Because the nonsensically foolish behavior of girls is what stimulates the instinct.
//This has nothing to do with shaming. It's likely more troll. He more like wants to see them have fun, see CCC0039 for example. -GHS
I wanted to see it, upfront, frank, direct.
//Troll levels approaching redline... -GHS
Therefore I carved it on her.
//He's just teaching her to not to be afraid to show herself. Unfortunately, what HE will see HE won't like. After all, didn't he escape the mansion with Youko because the people there behaved like this? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I'm coming OK? Put out your palm."
//Like in sex scenes, Taichi is very eroge protag-like in his total indifference to coming. What'd you expect of a dark nukige survivor, after all. -GHS

"Kyah... oh no... coming out... so much's coming out..."

"Try licking it."

"Yeah."

"Not a problem!"

"...stop talking to Miyasumi-senpai."
//Just replace that first T with a Y already. Being in love with the tsun of a tsundere is no more possible than being in love with the kuu of a kuudere. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How come?"

Fixing my eyes on her, I conjectured and surmised.

[Taichi]
"We're not really doing anything to be guilty about, right?"

[Touko]
"I said no. Stop. And then stay by my side."
//She never wanted aloofness, she never liked it, just like Youko. And now that she wants someone, and will go at any length for it, Taichi's immediately disinterested. Monsters? Still nowhere to be seen. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...and I'm not, right now?"

[Touko]
"More..."

[Taichi]
"More you say..."
[Taichi]
"The point is, I go to club therefore no matter what I'll have conversations with Senpai and..."

[Touko]
"The club, quit it."

[Taichi]
"Don't talk nonsense!"

[Touko]
"Miyasumi-senpai, you meddler..."
//So so so very Youko this one. If she had the character to express herself, of course. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Touko?"

Dangerous.

[Touko]
"If she went away that'd be good, maybe."
//Because no one here is in practice a cold-blooded murderer, Sending People Away means really one thing. -GHS

This is dangerous.

[Taichi]
"Come now, steadfast!"

[Touko]
"...eh?"

She comes to her senses.

[Taichi]
"Keep yourself steadfast now. You felt weird right there."
//This is possibly how Taichi feels when he goes in his delusions. -GHS

[Touko]
"Ahhh, apologies..."
[Touko]
"Hoh hoh... say, is there anything else that you want to do?"
//She's proactive. She likes it. Like all normal humans. The defilement is all in Taichi's head. -GHS

"Hee-y."
//HACK out -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

No dice, huh.
Touko had gone on alone ahead of me, and walking really fast.
I trailed close,
and lined up next to her.
Touko, with her high haughtiness, naturally does not want to even look my way.
Stretching over a hand, I attempt a talon grab on her chest.

"Yyh?!

[Touko]
"KEEP SILEEEEEENT!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ojou-samaaaa!!!"

Was the gate just left open like this?
It's as if it's ushering us in.
I thought of this as nothing more than a hellish prison,
but now it's as a gentle womb, a welcoming place where we can have peace of mind.
There are no people.
Not one, nowhere.
So only at school, only at the Gunjou Institute, do we have a natural place to meet and gather.
Dragged inside to carry on the past.
In truth, the fall of mankind was exactly as big a problem as expected.
I think it would have become the finishing blow. For almost all humans.
To me it became the good news, to them, it is a slow and despondent death.
And that is why Touko couldn't but come to my home.
So ironic.
Predictably, Touko was there.

[Taichi]
"You're quick on your school commute."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And yet you came to school in normal clothes again?"
[Taichi]
"You really manage to wear that hot-looking thing often, can't you."

Ignored.

[Taichi]
"Hey hey."

Shrugging my shoulder, I sit in the seat next Touko's... mine.
I gaze at her profile.
It might be murderous quietness hers, but there is awareness of me, and I know.

[Taichi]
"Sorry for last night."

[Touko]
"...you have absolutely not reflected on it..."

[Taichi]
"Naaah, see."

[Touko]
"...you're always like this, Taichi."
[Touko]
"It's like nothing of me never even catches your eye."
//Now it reads in proper context. The self-absorbed bitch (has to be said). -GHS
[Touko]
"So quick to be alone... acting so egotistically."

[Taichi]
"Don't I now. I better make some self-reflection."

[Touko]
"I wish, just a bit, that you cared."

[Taichi]
"And on that thought... I came ready."

[Touko]
"Ready?"

I drop a small mountain of croquette bread on Touko's desk.

[Taichi]
"So, appease your fasting to your heart's content!"
//HACK seems this older revision didn't have this change. -GHS

[Touko]
"NOT THE POOOINT!!!"

PoPoing.
And still, Touko's belly bug cried.
//HACK doll, independent doll shake -GHS

[Touko]
"Hfwhat?!"

[Taichi]
"Belly bug."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"Th-, this is something else!"

Belly bug.

[Taichi]
"The Belly Bug: Again."

[Touko]
"I'm telling you this is a separate matter!"

[Taichi]
"Hiding it is pointless, don't you know I am able to converse with belly bugs?"

[Touko]
"......what?"

[Taichi]
"Anyway, this means you're hungry."
[Taichi]
"Incidentally I'm hungry too."
[Taichi]
"Therefore, first period class is on croquette bread."

I tore open a package, and give a first bite.
Very happily it hadn't spoiled.

[Taichi]
"By the way, it's about time we reconciled."
[Taichi]
"...should be the moral thing to do I guess."
//HACK doll -GHS

Touko looked stunned.

[Touko]
"...say, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Nmuh?"

[Touko]
"...am I just some unwanted child to you, Taichi?"
//He indeed seems to have poor luck with girls whose name contains the kanji 子. Therefore, literal. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's not true at all!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"...then... why don't you come touch me?"
[Touko]
"I can't really... say that I don't want you to... we're living together, isn't that what it means?

[Taichi]
"...I don't want to corrupt you."

I bite into the bread.

[Taichi]
"I don't want to unravel the tension of rationality we have right now."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"...rationality you say..."

[Taichi]
"You, ya know, do you have the confidence to maintain yourself?"

And in these circumstances.
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"...I've no need to maintain myself."

[Taichi]
"You didn't forget what it was you did all that time ago, right?"
//Her stabbing herself -GHS

"Taichi, that was your..."
//The Formatting. And the fault was, at best, shared. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whatever it was I did, that sort of thing isn't something you normally do."

[Touko]

[Taichi]
"I really and truly like you, Touko."

"Then..."

"But what I like is the normal Touko."

"The Tsun Touko, the Touko fighting with the world."
//The one that doesn't exist, see CCD5001. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Therefore Touko, I'm not your means of escape."
//Translation: "don't live in my pretend no-people world please." As Taichi was Youko's way out of the Mansion. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And so, that's something that can't become true love."

Even if I don't particularly mind that myself,
Touko, after all this, will have to live on alone.
Therefore, she needs the power to fight.
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"And therefore... you dumped me..."

[Taichi]
"Well..."
[Taichi]
"I'm not good with people depending on me, and I'm not good with depending on people."
[Taichi]
"Therefore I don't want to you to drown out either, Touko."
//Since being with Touko would erase him as it would being with Youko. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But because I like you, Touko, I'll be of assistance to prevent you from breaking."
[Taichi]
"And that... is a simple thing to say, indeed."

[Touko]
"......"
//HACK out -GHS

Wordlessly, I gnaw on the bread.

[Touko]
"...sob!"

She is moved to tears.

[Touko]
"Sob... uhykh... uh, ungggh..."

For the sake of making her emerge from the cocoon and fly.
I go to the toilet.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

[Youko]
"...Taichi."

Out she came.

[Youko]
"Syrupples Ostracized."

[Taichi]
"Eh...?"

[Youko]
"I also ostracize syrupples. Same as Taichi."
//"If only that Touko didn't exist..." hypocrite. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ah, right."

She looks expressionless, but in her eyes dwells determination.

[Taichi]
"I have understood the general direction of Your comments."
//Formal -GHS
[Taichi]
"Well, is that all you came to say?"

[Touko]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"However..."

What about herself?

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan."

[Youko]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"Love you. How about a kiss?'

[Youko]
"...Taichi!"

I receive a slimy snakelike embrace.
//See Youko. -GHSoHelpful

//See CCA0021. This makes more sense if Misato was sent back, so that Taichi inherited her power... or maybe I'm confusing this with Mega Man again. -GHS

Just like Youko can't kill anyone. -GHS

[Youko]
"Aaaah... ow... it hurts... it's... I'm sorry, I'm..."
//HACK doll here -GHS

[Touko]
"......sigh."

And with this we are at how many now?
Heavy sighs.
And me, next to her, with a stomach also heavy.
//Because of having eaten...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, wanna go to the beach?"

[Touko]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow, just the two of us."

[Touko]
"...but... you hate to be with me, Taichi..."

What mechanism made the Aura of Ignoring that had lasted until moments ago become this in a single bound is a mystery.

[Taichi]
"I don't hate that!"

I point a smile at her.

[Taichi]
"Not at all, not if you stay dignified, Touko."
//See CCC0003A. And back to Youko this went. Again. -GHS

[Touko]
"...dignified..."
[Touko]
"The things you tell me to do are so difficult, Taichi..."

"Love's a complex system."
//Specific http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A4%87%E9%9B%91%E7%B3%BB -GHS

So say I with Oscar class acting skills.

[Touko]
"Then, one thing I wanna hear... do you like me, really?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed so!"

I irradiated her with a Million Dollar Smile complete with the shining dazzle of white teeth.
//Beats irradiating her with the remote? see CCB2015 -GHS

[Touko]
"Siiigh."

The august youth is bewitched.

[Touko]
"I don't really get it but... it's fine, yes."
[Touko]
"You told me you like me."

So she says, spellbound.
//She really wants this to be a movie as badly as he wants this to be a VN. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Way too simple."
//This may be the exact same way Youko still sticks to Taichi. -GHS

The whispering murmur that I threw towards the opposing side from Touko then vanished far beyond a grove.
//Hum, Hasekura Mansion...? -GHS

[Touko]
"...what a weird guy that I ended up in love with."

Touko stretched, seeming a little cheerful.
Truly, what odd taste we have.
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Friday, then."

There remain three days to the swingback of the world.
Let's do what's expected of us today, as well.
//HACK ??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"So I might say, but..."

I look at the floor.
Touko was sleeping.
She had groaned 'it hurts, it hurts' as she does nightly, but she seems to have grown well accustomed to this.
She's soundly asleep.
So we go to the beach with this thing here, then.
The beach will put us in a good mood, yup.
Lots and lots of things I must absolutely pay attention to.
Should we end up doing anything sexual, I have no confidence I'll be able to maintain self-control.

[Taichi]
"Gotta give it aaall!"

Due to my obstinately persistent avoidance of all bare skin bodily contact, we ended up in a quarrel.
Touko grew contrary and had gone on somewhere on her own.

[Taichi]
"...really, I told you I'm sorry for that thing."

'That thing'.
It was about that downward incline---
//HACK to white before black -GHS
............
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What was that all about, Touko!"

I pressed Touko for an answer.

[Taichi]
"Trying to do that... in front of everybody."
//See above. When SHE is afraid of others finding out he doesn't have a problem. This is exclusively about control. -GHS

[Touko]
"...but it's none of their business!"

[Taichi]
"None of their business, really?"

[Touko]
"Isn't it better if it's just the two of us now?"

[Taichi]
"Seriously now... this is just..."
//HACK these lines are IMO just more confusing, but at least there's no odd lack of segue in Taichi's line about the train. -GHS

Touko... stopped selecting the places in which to make expressions of love.
//This is Touko's equivalent of the Youko theater thing, and possibly of the bad end to her route. Taichi seems to think he 'broke' her by awakening her to sex, when it's just her having one more tool at her disposal to try to do what she wanted to do all along: make him her slave. -GHS
True, there's often couples kissing inside trains, but,
//Seems to be a reference to a Thing Not To Do stereotype in manga/anime/VNs. Oddly enough, since the only real way into Kamisaka is by train, that means Touko has rode the train at least once. If you know what I mean, and I wish I didn't because that was meant literally dammit. -GHS
that I would be made to do that, I'd never have thought it possible.
//BTW, it's still not quite clear whether what happened had anything to do with literal peniFUUUCKtrains. Not that it matters. -GHS

[Touko]
"How about we do it right here, right now?"

[Taichi]
"Seriously now!"

[Touko]
"It'll be embarrassing though."

[Taichi]
"You even listening?"

[Touko]
"And then, I believe they will understand, all of them."
//She's actively hoping people walk in on the two of them having sex, so as to make it's obvious he's hers alone. Continuing the parallel, this is therefore why Youko did that back then. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Touko, you've been acting weird lately."
//HACK ouch -GHS

[Touko]
"And you haven't been weird, Taichi?"

Boisterous laughter.
//Yandere laughter. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

And I realized,
that for Touko to have been brought to Gunjou, she had to have that something... it's normal she would.
//This is hilarious. Taichi whines and whines that he's in Gunjou because he's ZOMG EVILS, but he didn't think for one damn second that Touko would be the same! This is how he takes others lightly, and why he totally cheats on the test to have a super-high score. Pure emo. -GHS
Maybe it's jealousy, maybe it should be called madness, I can't come to a conclusion.
Just that Touko was, little by little, becoming something that I could no longer control.
//But was controlling her what he wants? Possibly, see Youko Bad End. Up that hand in her, and manipulate. -GHS
I was the one who first came to senses.
Things would get much worse from that point onwards, that was trivial to understand.
It is the very best decision to act before it becomes too late for treatment.
Anyone can understand that, but no one can actually do it.
I decided to reformat our relationship.
//Let's just keep this computer related, since he wants this to be VN-like so damn badly. -GHS
............
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
HACK different transition back -GHS
It became evening, and I had touched our contrarian Touko just a little.
Really, just a little.
We looked at the sea standing shoulder to shoulder.
Her angry bearing did not collapse,
//As in she didn't stop being tsun. -GHS
but I can feel the conflict of inner intentions.
That is how much I could understand the heart of a woman.

[Taichi]
"So then, isn't it about time we went to sleep?"

[Touko]
"Wof."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, you're so bad at chess for being a wealthy lady, Touko."

I stretch.

[Touko]
"...woof."

Results were 10 wins, 0 losses.
On return from the beach, Touko continued to be ill at humor, so to distract her I challenged her to a game.

[Taichi]
"Want some midnight snacks?"

[Touko]
"Wof."

Her head shakes left and right to the neck.

[Taichi]
"Well, to sleep then."

I entrusted my flesh to the soft and fluffy bed.

[Touko]
"...wooof... (tears)"

Touko laid down on the stiff hard floor.
//HACK out music. This wasn't in either console version, but this scene really sounds like crap with this music. -GHS
Still silence creeps upon us, filling the surroundings.
Is Touko sleeping already?

[Taichi]
"...sorry."

There is no reply.
But before long,

[Touko]
"Say... Taichi..."

Words from my back.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"
//HACK music. This also wasn't in any version, but it's in CCB2017 anyway. -GHS

[Touko]
"Will we always be able to be... together, I wonder..."

[Taichi]
"...I will be always and forever within your heart, Touko."
//He's so damn Jesus it hurts. -GHS

[Touko]
"...heheh, then we should be alright I guess."

[Taichi]
"Where's this coming from?"

[Touko]
"Because, people have vanished right? So, someday the two of us too..."

[Taichi]
"..."

The two of us, she says.
//Once again explaining CCB2017 -GHS

[Touko]
"If we do disappear, at least if we're together... it'd..."
//HACK to sky -GHS

Words contracted into silence. Touko was asleep.
For a while, I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't but think:
when Touko will again become alone, how much time will it take before she can get back up on her feet again?
Is her getting back up on her feet itself something even possible?
But... whatever, whichever it is... my decision won't change.

[Taichi]
"Sorry."

The second apology I made was breathed in by the dead of the night.
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
It's Saturday.
...one more day.
There is one more day.

[Taichi]
"fWaaah..."

Out of the bed.

[Touko]
"Zzz, zzz..."
//HACK ooh, again -GHS

Touko had been sleeping next to me.
An easy, light sleeper's breathing.
//Contrast with CCA0010. Am I overthinking this yes I am. -GHS
What is known as deep sleep.

[Taichi]
"..."

Seems she just sneaked in as she pleased in the middle of the night.

[Touko]
"...zzz, zzz."

Tranquil peaceful sleeping,

[Taichi]
"...heh."

her sleeping face is like a child's.
//Compare Misato. -GHS
Well, it's no problem.
//HACK disable CG, sky instead -GHS
I go outside alone.
The air is clean and clear.
It's not cool, but it's not warm.
Maybe we're losing the total amount of heat.
//I think he's wondering about whether the dying world is losing heat due to its end or something. -GHS
I have no means to ascertain.
//...more likely probably just realizing that they've been in who knows what season by now. -GHS
And then, me and Touko.

[Taichi]
"I haven't... exactly made any special memory with her, but..."

Not too close, not too far: a neutral position.
We spent one week staying exclusively within the ideal physical and emotional distance.
Touko has not shattered, nor become dependent.
If there is no dependence then... there's no need for formatting either.
Formatting... yes, that was a mistake of mine.
//At that point he still believes going back to the way things were while ignoring all that came between then and there is possible. That's likely why he invents the time loop. But even taking the loop seriously, the relationships between people don't stay the exact same between routes. He still hasn't quite understood this even in Sendback, that's why he'll try to run away in CCX0001. -GHS
That was my misreading of the human called Touko.
Even now I feel that horror.
............
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
I decided to reformat our relationship.
............
//HACK faster transition -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh---?"

Formatting in progress.

[Touko]
"What did you say, just then?"

Formatting in progress.

[Touko]
"...that's not true, right?"
[Touko]
"You're just joking like always, right?"

Formatting in progress.
//HACK doll -GHS

[Touko]
"...ahah, what are you saying now, really you dummy."
//1) Denial -GHS
[Touko]
"But you can't swindle me!"
//See CCA0027, or above. But who swindled who is no simple thing to say, actually. -GHS
[Touko]
"......"
[Touko]
"...you serious?"

Formatting in progress.

[Touko]
"...but you like me, right, all of me?"

Formatting in progress.

[Touko]
"...wh... you..."
[Touko]
"Do you even understand yourself... what you're saying?"

Formatting in progress.

[Touko]
"Absolutely... I'll never accept that... I'll never accept it, so,"
[Touko]
"I'll tell on you! To everyone in club!"
[Touko]
"I'll tell your family, and I'll tell the whole school!"
[Touko]
"All of it, I'll expose all you've done!"
//2) Anger. This is nonsense - who'd care? I doubt the authorities would care even if it was actual rape (though I've no doubt her grandfather would tear him apart - but she never tells HIM now does she). -GHS

Formatting in progress.

[Touko]
"...Taichi... stop it already... I don't like that..."
[Touko]
"Say, how about we go shopping? I'll buy you some clothes."
//3) Bargaining -GHS
[Touko]
"Taichi...?"
[Touko]
"Wa-... wait..."

Formatting failure---
And then---
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS

[Touko]
"...Taichi... look..."
[Touko]
"I got... hurt... Taichi... owChCh... it hurts..."
//4) Depression, specifically moral blackmail. -GHS
[Touko]
"It hurts lots you know? I might die..."
[Touko]
"...there's so much blood coming out..."
[Touko]
"So... be gentle now... Taichi..."
[Touko]
"Be more gentle... stay at my side...!"
[Touko]
"Ow... hurts..."
[Touko]
"Taichiiii... come out alreadyyy...!"
//Vs. "get out of here" -GHS
[Touko]
"Look at iiit, at my blood... I'm telling you to looook!"
[Touko]
"If you do, you'll be all gentle again all quick."
[Touko]
"Taichiii, come ooooout..."

Had Youko-chan not been there,
Touko would not have lived, and the situation would have been much more serious.
Touko was discharged from the hospital, and when she returned to school she was...
//See Sakuraba. Except this one's much more Touko's fault, regardless of how dumb Taichi was to do what he did. The reason she doesn't learn something is actually simple: the wound was self-inflicted. Perhaps, if Taichi had hurt her, Touko would no longer be like this. -GHS
She was just like before... no, more than before, she had become more thoroughly---
//5) acceptance... or is it? -GHS
She had become beautiful.
//Annnd back again. Taichi loves 'em works of art, not living. Which is an elaborate way of saying "he's into 2D". -GHS
I thought that Touko in her isolated solitude was beautiful.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
I cover my face.
Graphically vivid red blood,
//This could even be the true source of Taichi's fear of blood. Oh, but it was in the flashbacks? Like his silver hair... -GHS
so much that it feels like it is still spreading onto my retina.
I loved her,
all about her, but,
my ethics are not very good when things don't go my way.
//Which is the whole point here. -GHS
Senpai, and Miki, and Kiri and...
And all the humans around me I look at with the same eyes, eyes of equal loving care.
//See Kiri: she sees it as eyes of hunger. Not completely incorrect, however. -GHS
And for Touko, as well, there will be a portion of love equal to the others.
And that will not have the shape of the 'love' she wants.

[Taichi]
"...won't this just hurry and end already."

In the impatience for this determination I can't make, my heart felt like it was physically dilating.
//HACK earlier end music -GHS
And then, tomorrow is Sunday---
//Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS
HACK Another 360 exclusive -GHS
As I wake up, I find Touko crying in her sleep.

[Touko]
"...ngh... sob..."

It's got to be loneliness.
I gently pass a hand in that hair clinging to her forehead.
She cannot be completely fulfilled with me alone.
//Physical impossibility, which still she believes possible... as he sort-of does, still. -GHS
Current time is before noon.
//Term can mean just about anything from daybreak to noon, so it can be well before 10AM. The odd imprecision smell of troll more than writing errors, sort of like not making every single number or stuttering boil down to 7 or 8. -GHS
Seems we overslept.

[Taichi]
"Touko, Touko!"

I wake her up.
//HACK back to bedroom -GHS

[Touko]
"'hat mnow...?"
//??????lisping cat??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wake up. We're going."

[Touko]
"...eh... where?"
//HACK doll inserted -GHS
[Touko]
"Really, where are you taking me?"
//That's a good question. Isn't this way beyond the hokora? -GHS

[Taichi]
"To a nice place."

............
//HACK disable doll -GHS

[Touko]
"What's here...?"

[Taichi]
"C'mon."

I made a perplexed Touko stand in the specific location.

[Taichi]
"..."

And stare, fixed, at her.

[Touko]
"Hey... what are you starting now?"

[Taichi]
"A questioning round! Please answer the following with honesty."

[Touko]
"Y-, yes..."

[Taichi]
"Are you lonely?"

[Touko]
"Eh... dunno, maybe, I wonder..."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you lonely now that people are gone?"

[Touko]
"...lonely, I should say... uneasy is more like it, but..."

[Taichi]
"Want to go home? To your house?"

[Touko]
"...well... if I could go back to that time... who wouldn't want to, right?"
//To BEFORE she was sent to Gunjou, not back to her home dimension. This was always the point with her. -GHS
[Touko]
"Hey, what're you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Next question."
[Taichi]
"You have always been alone, Touko, but why is that?"
//She's been alone <-> there's no one. Complete correspondence. -GHS

[Touko]
"...why, now... you ask me but... I don't know."
[Touko]
"Just... it was frustrating... having been made into some kind of deviant... and being repelled away just because of that... no one came to talk to me again..."
[Touko]
"What else but to be by myself..."
[Touko]
"But then you came and talked to me, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"...sorry."

I can do nothing but give a mere apology.
//For not letting her rot in what likely would end up in her starving herself to death for real, not just repeated trips to the infirmary. Yeah, great reader of people to the last. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Last question then."
[Taichi]
"Do you... like me?"

[Touko]
"...well..."
[Touko]
"Yeah, I like you..."

Perhaps it was because they were our last words,
that these ordinary, mediocre words struck the heart as if they were rending it.
Yeah.
It should be about right with this.

[Taichi]
"Well, Touko, don't dare misunderstand this 'K?"
[Taichi]
"This right now is not me tossing you away, I'm serious, you hear me?"
[Taichi]
"Be in good health."

[Touko]
"...but Taichi, I can't understand what you've been doing here..."

Shutter click---
I close my eyes.
The distortion is for me alone to see unoccluded.
//And he sees by closing his eyes. Awesome. -GHS
This same place yet exists on both this and on the other side, and the one to determine which is me.
//With the implied, but largely unasked, questions of what determines which spot and what time. -GHS
That is how I led everyone here at the start.
And how I could perform Sendback as well.
//No road exists but through Him. -GHS
I opened my closed eyes, and looked again.
Touko's figure had vanished.

[Touko]
"...what even the devil... wait, eh?"

[Taichi]
"Taichi? "

[Touko]
"KYAH?!"
[Touko]
"Eh... a radio? When did he even put it in my pocket..."
[Touko]
"...how can it even receive?"
[Touko]
"TAICHIII, this is big, the radio!"
//Just like CCE0001, I'm considering all these scenes to be at least partly not real. -GHS
[Touko]
"Ah, really... where did you go! Dummy!"
[Touko]
"Taichi, I'm talking to youuu!"
//HACK disconnected. This was missing from all the routes but Misato's. -GHS
This had night already. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Fare thee well, Touko."
//See CCC3004. Sakuraba sends them away. -GHS

And with this, once again, all kinds of possibilities have vanished.
Touko will no longer be in that classroom.
And being slain by her sword is also gone in perpetuity.
//Which never happened. -GHS
So is being clung all sticky-sticky as well.
And being punched too.
All the paths that Touko had for me... are with this completely severed.
From here onwards, I must make do with treasuring all the recollections I have made up until now.
Ruminate and think over and ponder and muse, but living with that and nothing else.

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha commiserate now."

Not yourself.
Hold down the corner of your eyes, with your fingertips, hold them down.
//Because of tears, but since he's in full Bwaah Me Can't Cry mode, going with overliteral. -GHS
Come to a clear cut decision with all your power,
and continue still.
Because there still are things that you absolutely must accomplish.
//HACK earlier end music, NVL mode -GHS
               See you next week---
