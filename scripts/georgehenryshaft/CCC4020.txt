I expect Kiri to be waiting for a chance to attack.
In the cafeteria as well as the rooftop, I managed to sense her,
therefore there was no attack.
//But that would mean she sensed that he sensed. That's not quite right. -GHS
...luring her appears simple.
//HACK to black -GHS
I go in the toilet.
//HACK back -GHS
The moment I left, I could feel a murderous intent for an instant, but... it soon withered away.
//SHE is not so stupid as to enter the boys' toilet. -GHS
I walked slowly down the corridor.
I don't really think she'll attempt attacking all that many times.
She will be laying in wait,
//Swap around -GHS
someplace safe, I'm certain.
...there was nothing in the corridor.
CALL CCC3014
//HACK call the script that calls the script... -GHS
HACK To BG, music off. -GHS
...and yet, even that unity had its downfall, to the point of reciprocal murder.
//Again the miniature garden etc. -GHS
The heart shakes.
Why... why like this.
My irritation doesn't lessen.
Rather.
//Works better with periods this one, èŠ‹. -GHS
I thought that it would be nice if it all just were no more.
//This is what he felt at the end of the training camp. He's just doing it again and again... -GHS
After that I strolled around the town, unseriously wasting some time.
There were no attacks.
We have a wuss here.
//HACK music "Starry Heavens" -GHS
And,
I return back.
As I thought, without someplace she's comfortable with, she's just distressed.
Ahhh, but,
what am I even doing.
//HACK no need now -GHS
There is no one.
Until just a little ago, Touko was among us.
People had vanished, yet Touko's personal conduct would not alter.
//HINT HINT -GHS
...although she had so many difficulties with self-reliance.

[Taichi]
"I know you can't really stomach it, but couldn't you try coming to Club starting tomorrow?"

And that's how my soliloquy goes.
If Youko had been among us, that's what I thought I would be telling her.
Those words were so very late.
And once more I came to the rooftop.
Senpai was working.

[Misato]
"Heave ho, heave ho...!"

Doing her best in her work gloves.
I beg your pardon, for I am involved in battle.
//Formal -GHS
I quietly closed the door.
//HACK and someone put the fullbrite version of this BG here too. -GHS
Around here then?
I sit on the chair waiting, alert.
Reading a manga magazine, unseriously wasting some time.
However, my awareness was on my surroundings.
It closes in,
slowly, slowly,
that murderous intent.
She is radiating into the surroundings that very malice that she should herself hate.
The thread of mental strain is drawn taut.
Don't come here...
//Seems to be sort of begging. -GHS
The door, silently, opens five centimeters,
but I already knew.
It's likely that even a normal person would feel it with this much killing intent.
The dark shine of the tip of a bolt turned towards me.
Killing intent slams into me.
Sounding out the timing, I roll sideways with skill.
CIN 4 480 0 0 0
CR 0
//HACK in the bolt. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ah!"
//HACK out bolt. SFX is different. -GHS

The arrow passed through the place I was just a moment before.
//HACK to corridor, earlier music -GHS
Springing up, I fly out in the corridor.
There's Kiri's runaway behind.

[Taichi]
Hahah..."

I chased.
This game of chase is different from the one on Monday, Kiri,
for I am now writhing in joy.
//HACK unneeded now. -GHS
I give chase.
Kiri flees. From time to time, she turns to look back.
Recognizing me, she further raises her running speed.
...you'll only get tired, Kiri.
//Wondering if this is intended to be about that "you'll only die tired" line. -GHS
We crossed the main gate,
does she want to go to town?
//Sometimes it just... works. -GHS
Holding that weapon, Kiri's speed is in no way particularly fast.
I pursued with pondered pace.
Suitably, as to not let her nock a bolt, as to not let her rest.
//...but not fast enough to capture her. The only thing that stopped him on Monday was the chastity belt - and then Nanaka (AKA his instincts). He could totally catch her without a problem. Or could he? Either he truly doesn't want to kill her, which is absurd for Mr. Insane when confronted with someone who obviously hates his guts and has repeatedly tried to kill him. -GHS
Eventually, Kiri went to the mountain trail.
//She might have been told this place was dangerous by Miki? Maybe she knows about the traps? Maybe she knows Miki's there? Or is she just comfortable in the woods? Then again, she IS stupid and this might just be another of her awful decisions. This is more evidence that this is the inspiration for Trap Mountain in Higurashi. -GHS
Don'tcha go destroy yourself, I thought.
//It's odd that Murderous Maniac would be begging Kiri in his thoughts not to do stupid things, at least technically. -GHS
And then,
at the hokora, Kiri's entire strength was exhausted.
She conceals herself in a thicket.

[Taichi]
"...Kiri, at last... you've finally done it, haven't you."
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

              A declaration of war,
//No cross-conversation here: she brought this on herself. -GHS
                  of conflict,
               with me, right now.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"You've become my enemy, you know."

[Kiri]
"Hah, haaah, hah..."

Frantically straightening her wild breathing,
and trying to load a bolt, impatiently,
on the other side of the thicket.
It's imaginable that in her state Kiri would encounter difficulties.
Lacking sufficient mastery means things are not going to go smoothly at those critical times.
Kiri is in Game Over with this.
I took out the knife.
Killing won't be necessary, I think,
//He doesn't plan to kill even someone who *repeatedly tried to kill him for no good reason*. -GHS
but still I took it out,
I don't know why.
An excessively strong instinct made me take that action.
//Youko is often found seen a knife in her hand, isn't she. -GHS
The postscript of rationality.
If one becomes somewhat freaked out, all their abilities disappear.
//Sukoshi Fuantei - heh, SF. "Fuantei" is what's used for Taichi's unstable intellect in CCA0003. Maybe that's what it was all along... -GHS
And now, still just to frighten her, I pierce through just the blade into the hedge of the thicket.

[Kiri]
"...kyah... hah, haaaaaah..."

Just for that she was dyed fully of the color of fear.
And then, I,
//HACK flash white -GHS

[Taichi]
"!!!!"

Using the entirety of the springiness of my body, I twisted my upper half.
//...unrivaled springiness... -GHS
Second shot. A jet black bolt penetrated the space where my forehead was point one second before.
What a timing that was!
I was befuddled for a while,
for about five seconds.
//Given the similarities between their behaviors, this is likely how she avoided being killed by Youko back in CCC3012A. Of course it can mean Youko and Taichi simply cross-trained, but then, why would Taichi who apparently CAN kill act like Youko, who can't? This whole scene is what happened back then seen from the point of view of "Youko". -GHS
Admiration, and shock,
of how perfectly Kiri had managed to deceive me.
I clear away the thicket.
On the other side... too late, the girl's figure was no more.
All I could hear was the sound of tall weeds being pushed through, as she returned to the mountain path.
My desire to follow had gone.
//He's scared shitless. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ha ha, 'mazing."

That was near-death.
Death.

[Taichi]
"My heart's all boom, boom!"

I confirmed by putting a hand on the dead of the chest.
What excitement.
I have been tasting the joy of living by dark means.
I write in the journal, then go to sleep.
Would Kiri's assault be tonight?
Will I be able to skillfully detect it?
It seemed like I would be able to have nice dreams.
//He's more interested in the game than in killing her. He doesn't mind death, but he wants plausible deniability. -GHS
