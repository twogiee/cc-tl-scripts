"..."

A revolving world, then.
How many times have I even repeated this very Monday?
And while immersed in all thoughts like that,
I spot Miki.
I'm also spotted in return.

[Taichi]
"Hoooy, Mickey Mo---"
//ミッキーマウス  -GHS

On that very instant I attempt to spit out that copyright-wise hyper unsparing reference,
//This seems written a bit later than the rest, and considering that voice files aren't split by script file, possibly even cutting it relatively close to development deadline. Wonder if Tanaka was scolded for all the references, however censored... see CCZDXC for more. -GHS
she breaks into a run,
towards where I am,
despite a stumble.
//See CCC0011C? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wah, sorry! That was my fault! I didn't know the Sonny Bono Act was constitutional!"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Bono_Copyright_Term_Extension_Act Curiously, he had died January of 1998. Even more curiously, this is a reference to the *American* constitutionality of that act... -GHS

[Miki]
"BWAAA〜〜〜〜〜〜HAAA!!!"

She was crying.

[Taichi]
"What is it?!"

She flew into my chest.
//It's pretty much impossible to notice with the window there, but she has a pretty nasty-looking cut on her left knee. Is that why she's crying...? -GHS
I catch her.

[Miki]
"Senpai, SenpaiSenpaiSenpaaaaaai!!!"

Sobbing lament.

[Miki]
"There's no ooo~ne! It's weee~~ird, this is totally weee~ird!!!"
//It looks way too weird with all the tildes. The solution is to find some way to add furigana! So, if we take ~ = nuki-GHS

Weak!!!
//Meaning he remembers her strong. -GHS
Is this sort of like not having enough XP I wonder?
//How does he remember this?! -GHS

[Miki]
"There is no one inside anyone's house! There's really no one, they're all gone, all!!!"
//Of course, they've all left to go to work by this hour. That's what 'bedtown' means. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Y-, you didn't get that part yesterday night?"
//Indeed. That's because she's faking it, or, at least, taking the 98 game as seriously as Taichi is, meaning the difference between fake and real is borderline irrelevant. -GHS

I soothe her by patting her back.
//But that's the job for Nagusa, not Nadame! CALL THE COOOOOOOPS -GHS
I am weak to girls' tears.
//...hence the "weak" above meant...? -GHS

[Miki]
"But, buuut!"

[Taichi]
"I'm still with you, you know."

[Miki]
"...sob, sob, yes... so happy... that you're here..."

But that was a joke.
//Well, she's kidding too. -GHS

[Miki]
"I woke up this morning, and mother wasn't there, and there wasn't to eat... and that's why I started thinking, what if everybody else is gone too, and..."
//Keeping "gohan" as breakfast, but she could literally mean that there was no rice in her breakfast. Her mother simply goes to work earlier than she goes to school, which would be normal given they have a commute, and Miki is either expected to buy something at Tasaki on the tab, cook something up herself, or has breakfast that doesn't involve rice - Taichi's never has. See CCA0004: that's another reason Miki's tab is brought up. Nothing in here that demands the end of mankind. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And you got frightened?"

Bob bob, a steady nod that rubs her forehead on me.

[Miki]
"I don't like it, not this... I don't like it..."

I look up at the sky.
//Hmmm, see CCC3008. And it repeats. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed it's lonely when people aren't there."

[Miki]
"...wanna go home..."
//The troll is multi layered, too: the "home" for mankind, in Christianity, is Heaven. The routes are beginning to get really religious here. -GHS

She says something clever,
that this is not our original world.
This here is World'.
//Whatever Miki did had nothing to do with forgetting, and this is rubbing it into readers' faces. -GHS
Miki's words may have been coincidental, but,
they hit the nail on the head.

[Taichi]
"You wanna go home then..."

[Miki]
"Wanna go home, I wanna go home..."

[Taichi]
"What a problem, then, what do we do!"

There... is a method to console Miki.
//The cops restored Nagusa back to her rightful place. They also said that Kiri vs. Kasumi thing is under investigation. They'll be letting me know how it goes provided I go with the nice men that are coming to take me to a really nice place. -GHS
It's a somewhat cowardly method.
A method that exists because the two of us are fellows, similar in many ways.
Because the limit is one week,
anything and everything becomes possible.
//He's gonna try doing what she did. He's setting up the fall with his own hands. -GHS
People doing their absolute hardest in life live in ways that resemble having no regrets.
For those of us peculiar to this one single week, living without hurry is impermissible.
//Now he "remembers" that everybody's peculiar to the week. -GHS
The moment I envisioned several catchphrases with which to invite Miki,
//To a date, see Sendback. This is literally impossible without Kiri out of the way somehow. -GHS
a kick came.

[Kiri]
"Sh'yaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ghaaah!"

Kiri's kick plucked me off Miki.

[Taichi]
"Whass'at ya doin'!"
//Kansai -GHS

[Kiri]
"Please cease these acts of molestation!"

[Taichi]
"I'm not molester!"

[Kiri]
"You are 100% a molester."
//~random trivia~ it's impossible for a man to be less than 75% a molester. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Told you I'm not a molester!"

[Miki]
"Bwahhh, Kiri-chin..."

Miki was enervated,
and then went to hug Kiri.

[Miki]
"Bwheee〜〜〜〜〜〜h!"

[Kiri]
"It's alright, it's alright now."

What?

[Taichi]
"So Miki... you're not going to prove my innocence at all?"
//She's totally doing this on purpose. -GHS

[Miki]
"Sob, hyKh, uHkh."

She was sobbing,
whereas Kiri is sharply glaring at me.

[Kiri]
"...inexcusable."
//Indeed, this scene is so dull and cliche' that it should be far below Tanaka's standards. That's also why I believe Miki's orchestrating it: because it fits the mediocre and bland tropes that would be the best Miki would be able to do after "reset" just TOO well. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Molesting is absolutely inexcusable!"

[Taichi]
"Ya got it wrong!"

[Kiri]
"Miki is crying, that is proof!"
//Still rushing to conclusions. -GHS

[Taichi]
"(well, well, well, well.)"

This ain't a joke now!
Is this the way that false charges are created?
Nothing left to do but to run.
Dassh'u!

[Kiri]
"Ahhh! He ran away!"
