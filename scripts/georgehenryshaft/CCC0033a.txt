"Munch, munch...... huh?!"
[Taichi]
"Youko-chan, could it be that you are hungry?"

Bob bob steady nod.

[Taichi]
"Wanna eat?"

Bob bob steady nod.

[Taichi]
"Then, come here. I will be feeding you."
//HACK back too close. -GHS

She approaches in a single long stride.
That was the distance to avoid my bullying, but this is point-blank range.

[Taichi]
"Say, aaaah."

Mouth opens.
The sandwich marches onwards.
The very moment before the mouth closes I pull it back and eat it myself.

[Taichi]
"Nom, nom!"
//HACK unneeded -GHS

[Youko]
"........................"

[Taichi]
"Sorry, sorry, just joking."
[Taichi]
"Here, this time for real. Say aaaah."
//HACK still zoomed -GHS

I repeated the same thing.

[Taichi]
"Nom, nom!"

[Youko]
"................................................"
//Whoa, they're still the correct number despite it being the absolute limit of the screen before the cursor is pushed down or word wrap ensues. -GHS

I felt pressure.
//She's like a less hands-on Touko. ...well, she IS. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiddin', kiddin! This time it's really for real!"
[Taichi]
"Here, haaave it."

I float it to the left.
//HACK move left, eyes closed -GHS

[Youko]
"Ah..."

Youko-chan moves in a totter, sandwich the aim.
//Now she's Misato. -GHS
Without delay I send the hand to the opposite side.
//HACK right side -GHS

[Youko]
"Ah..."

She moves to the opposite side.
//HACK out with everything, clock dissolve -GHS
Six more times around and around we repeated all over again.
//HACK and back with all the changes, fade in -GHS

[Youko]
"...'s fine. Going home to hikikomori."
//See CCB0007. Twice it's enemy action, there's a subtle Tomoki going on here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Told you I'm joking!"
