[Kiri]
"WHAAA?!"
//There are, of course, 7 characters between the quotes. Because nana is seven. -GHS

Kiri shakes in horror.

[Kiri]
"What kind of underwear...?"

I was still as yesterday, when Miki equipped me (to use an expression more accurate than 'made me wear') with elephant trunks.
//See CCC0023B: what but how the hell GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH -GHS

[Miki]
"Oh my? Senpai, you didn't take a bath?"

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Miki]
"Dirchyyy!"
//childish -GHS

[Kiri]
"Unclean..."

Guh, damn these hygienic pusses!
//... -GHS
Gathering together, torturing people!
//This isn't as funny, considering he probably saw the cruelty of the women of the Hasekura firsthand. See CCD0022A now. -GHS

[Miki]
"This is Summer you know?"

[Kiri]
"...if personality is like that, personal hygiene must match."

[Taichi]
"Are dirty people to be treated like sinners now?"
//For fun, check what the Leviticus has to say about bathing. No coincidence. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Maybe we should just dispose of this thing right here..."

[Taichi]
"Wait'cha!"

[Miki]
"Mngh. Senpai's Stock is dangling downwards quite a lot!"
//"Your stock (value) is going down" + "your dick is pretty dangly" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Does it gotta be every day? How 'bout every other day?"

[Kiri]
"I don't get this at all..."
//As I always do, I suspect more dick puns. -GHS

[Miki]
"Not taking one every day is to be below the average."

[Taichi]
"Ehhh, is that true? Youko-chan never said that to me... never explained that to me..."
//More hints that Youko is his mother, if laterally. -GHS

This sort of thing often happens to people who come into adulthood with their originality preserved due to not having exchanged information of this sort among friends of the same generation!
//Totally false. Here's a random tutu ballet to disprove it: [500Kb of mind-warping ASCII art redacted] -GHS
To be an ordinary person is incredibly hard!
//fnarr? -GHS

[Miki]
"What do we do, Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"This is bad, Miki."
//BTW: notice how Miki uses the same honorific that Taichi uses (disparagingly) on Kiri, while Kiri uses nothing. It's similar to how Taichi calls Youko with the -chan honorific. It's a distance between the two. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yup, it's bad."

A conspiracy in duo.

[Kiri]
"I thought he was weird, but that he'd be at this level, wow..."
//Oddly, it seems this is something the two had organized beforehand. More interesting is that they don't catspeak... if catspeak ever was a language. -GHS

[Miki]
"We gotta do it and no avoiding it, we do."

[Kiri]
"No avoiding it, indeed, yes."

[Miki]
"Well, we just have to be in club with this guy, after all."

[Kiri]
"Hm. Where to do this?"

[Taichi]
"What does the verb 'do' that you are consulting each other about refer to?"

The two ignore me and keep discussing.
Barely audible voices. I can only hear fragments:
//See CCA0015B and more. He may not hear anything at all. -GHS

[Miki]
"...someplace outside of the public eye..."

[Kiri]
"...and inconspicuous..."

[Miki]
"...with a strong drug..."
//Shampoo is a drug. They sell that in the drug store, which is right next to the saloon 'n the gravedigger, pardner. Yeee-haw! -GHS

[Kiri]
"...we must be resolute in doing this..."

What are those two even discussing?

[Taichi]
"...this atmosphere feels bad..."

Should I just try to run?

[Kiri]
"Don't move!"

[Taichi]
"Hyyy?"

Not happening. I cannot escape.
Stimulating Kiri any more than this would also be bad.

[Miki]
"Senpai, we have decided how we will deal with you."

[Taichi]
"...could I go back into my trousers maybe?"
//Further hinting that CCC3002 had a plot hole. -GHS

[Miki]
"Not happening."

[Taichi]
"What a demon!"

[Miki]
"You shall now be accompanying Us."

'Us' is among the things Miki says.
//Similar, but not quite, to CCA0027. But do see CCD4003, plenty of Miki and Yusa to go around. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I get it... but this poor treatment just because I didn't take a bath every day, really..."

[Miki]
"Most certainly not the point. You have no redeeming feature whatsoever in the first place, Senpai, therefore being virtuous in cleanliness is very much a duty!"
//清潔 same as CCA0010. And the imitative behavior continues. -GHS
[Miki]
"But you have been negligent, Senpai."

[Kiri]
"You are abnormal... in many ways."

The treatment for one abnormal.

[Miki]
"Let's go."

I was frog-marched.
//See CCA0021 -GHS
Then,

[Taichi]
"...eh, what are you making me do?"

I'm unreasonably uneasy.
Senpai had not yet come,
meaning that there is no one here that could save me.
Miki brought out a hose from the rooftop prefab,
while Kiri is guarding me with her crossbow.

[Miki]
"Senpai, remove your clothes."

[Taichi]
"Even more than this?"

[Kiri]
"..."

Clank, and I will be efficiently sniped with the crossbow.
//茶器? チャキチャキ, using both as SFX and meaning. I suspect he means "sniped" as in "aimed at", but it doesn't have that meaning in English and I don't want to change it... especially giving meaning 2 of snipe as a noun. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...HYES."

Stripping.
I strip off the shirt.
And I was now, very much precisely, only in my elephant trunks.

[Taichi]
"...these... too?"

[Miki]
"Nooo-ope, we shall excuse you on that."

And then, Miki opened the valve attached on the hose's grip.

[Miki]
"And now...!

An onslaught of strong water pressure on me.

[Taichi]
"uPfth!"

[Miki]
"Soh'raSoh'ra!"

So this is what it was:
Forced Cleaning.
//Seeing this used for printer heads, and generally around tech stuff. Might be similar to CCA0023 -GHS
Ahhh, if only it was a Forced Erotic Massage.

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, the drug!"

[Kiri]
"OK!"

Kiri spurted something at me.
//fnarr, fnarr -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ugh, b-, but that's...?"

Suffocating Citrus Mint.
//Curious how mint keeps returning, see CCA0013, CCB0013, CCC0011C. -GHS
Body soap?
She's grasping the bottle and showering me in it.

[Miki]
"And now, and now!"

Shipdeck scrub in hand, the two... SHIPDECK SCRUB?!
//Likely just a long-handled floor brush -GHS

[Miki]
"ATTAAAACK!"

[Kiri]
"E'hy! E'hy!"

I am cleaned like the deck of a ship.
//http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_did_sailors_scrub_the_deck <- this makes it even funnier IMO -GHS

[Taichi]
"OwChChChChChChChCh?!"
//てx8 -GHS

It prickle-prickles! It prickle prickles dammiiit!

[Taichi]
"I am not a ship deck!"
//See CCA0030 -GHS

Dammit, did they confuse me with a deck oven? Is it because I've eaten Kanpan from a house decked with them this morning? It's because I have a mess inside, don't I!
//See CCC4002. Mess Hall. No one got it? No one? Well, huff! *stomps away* -GHS
Or maybe it's because Kanpan also means ship deck. Is this world a pun?
//Engrish is not supposed to fail, ever, but as failsafe there's always telling the fourth wall what to do with itself. -GHS

[Miki]
"SOAP! SOAP SOAP!"

[Kiri]
"Soap, e'hy!"

Repeated calls of soap.
//OF soap, see below. -GHS
That makes my heart go a bit boom-boom.
I will, with soap, scrub, you girls, into soap, for soapland...
//Girl employed at a Soapland is ソープ嬢 (source:  http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%BD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89), supposing it's because in this circumstance it can be pronounced "soopu" too. Unfixed in the 360 version, which is the only that keeps it. Calling back 'scrub' from CCB0007. -GHS
Once more shipdeck scrub.
I grew accustomed to agony so now I didn't really care.
Rather, the prickle-prickle feeling is quite refreshing, yes.
//Taichi is a masochist, of course, but the way his masochism works is by diverting the pain into absurdities of sexual nature, due to his backstory of person forced to associate pain and sexuality. The path isn't direct deck scrub->pain->arousal, it's deck scrub->pain->delusion->arousal. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Mi-, Miki! Th-, the elephant...?!"

[Miki]
"uh-, WOAAAAAAH?! The elephant trumpeteeed!

Hosedown.

[Kiri]
"Pervert! PERVEEERT!!!"

[Taichi]
"I-, if you make me take this much stimulus... I can't do an-... uBlgh!"
//Hummm, see CCC3025 -GHS

[Miki]
"RaspRaspRaspRaaasp!"
//Voice actually does it 5 times, text is 4. -GHS

The scrubbing became serious.

[Kiri]
"KyAAAH, it came off! The elephant...!"

The hosedown removed it completely.
//Suuure. -GHS

[Miki]
"My Elephant Cover that I bought at the Atomic General Stooore?!"
//買った bought, and she runs (I mean, slips). Of course she might have bought it before, but let's face it: this is possibly evidence the store, at least, is still manned. More importantly, ぞうカバー still does not google to anything dirty. I am disappointment, Japan. I am the very concept of disappointment. -GHS

I knew it, the Atomic General Store...
That shopkeeper (female - hot - 25) is a pervert herself, so she sells everything indiscriminately.
//And THIS is why Taichi is always there. See CCB0008. Curiously, the implication there is that Miki could *not* buy her panties normally, here it seems the opposite, that it was the owner of the shop who sold them to Miki. More interesting it's that Taichi immediately runs to thinking that the owner would've sold her this stuff, not that she's no more and therefore Miki would've had no problem pilfering the stuff! 2+5=7, as typical, and perhaps also a hint of sorts. -GHS

[Miki]
"Look Kiri-chin, it's totally like a different animal!"
//Snake? -GHS

[Kiri]
"No way I'm looking! My eyes'll rot!"

You two elementary schoolgirls or something?

[Miki]
"Gh'meeeow, didn't it just shaaake?!"

[Kiri]
"KYAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!"

They ran off.
Naked and alone I am left behind.

[Taichi]
"...sniff."

Tears in the corners of the eyes.

[Misato]
"Fwaaah, so then, let us do our best today as well... hm?"
//Uncertain if she's just come, or if she was sleeping off nearby. -GHS
[Misato]
"KyAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"
//ぁx17, 8 -GHS

With that reaction she must be a virgin.

[Taichi]
"Sob."

Bittersweeet...
//Horonigai-> horonigeee. 3x'e' -GHS

[Taichi]
"BwaaHaaaHaaa!"

It ended up with me in tears.
Fwp!
//fnarrrrrrrrr it's like a letter away from fap -GHS
And right then I was wrapped by a bath towel.

[Miki]
"...awww, we ran away didn't we, sorry!"
[Miki]
"It was a stimulation excessively strong for us maidens. Here, have this."

New underwear and an uniform.
//How'd she have that? It's at least an hour round trip to Taichi's house. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wah, Miki... you're so nice!"

I dress.

[Miki]
"You became all clean, it's so nice!"

[Taichi]
"My whole skin smarts though."

[Miki]
"Kirichiii, Mimi-senpai, we're dooone!"
//Mimi-senpai. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...really〜?"

The panicky duo turned up.

[Miki]
"With all that done, let's get to club activities!"
//must... resist... "let's club activities"... garrrrrrr -GHS

She smiled, brightly.
And then we zealously went into club.
Ahhh, what simplicity we had.
What unity.
What even went wrong with that training camp that I went to so much trouble to establish by force?
//Remember what's about to happen. Miki's fake club cannot stand anymore than Taichi's training camp could. -GHS
Maybe the way I did it was wrong? Was I far too coercive?
What is the right way for people to touch each other?
I am so full of things I don't understand.
