[Taichi]
"...and still."

A script...
She failed that other one, so what is a good way of attacking now?
//"That one was rejected, so how do I attack this one" + "should I assault her somehow for saying that was rejected?" -GHS
The hand does not move.
The pen does not run.
Stagnation.

[Taichi]
"UhmNmNmN"
//He's totally twirling the pen between the upper lip and the nose. -GHS

Right!
Out of the dresser I produce a men's Kimono, and in Kinigashi style, casually dress with it.
//http://www.kimonoguide.com/dictionary/index3.html That seems to be a wearing style, not a specific type of kimono. Seems to be specifically used for "men's kimono", which are a specific type. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...the explosive birth of a master at literature."
//Continuing the Big Bang ref-- ehm, the metaphors. See below. -GHS

Because the mood is very important,
that is what I must do.

[Tomoki]
"Heeey!"
//Following the time-honored hard-boiled tradition of having a heavy with a gun walk in whenever you have writer's block... -GHS

A voice from the entrance.

[Taichi]
"What is it now?"

[Tomoki]
"Whoa... Taichi?"

Tomoki seemed to jitter in surprise at the sight of a man in Kimono materializing in front of him all of a sudden.

[Tomoki]
"What's that face..."

[Taichi]
"Vacate."
//Pissed at his 'face' remark. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"My mistake. I mean, what's that figure..."
//To be read literally, of course. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Truly a mistake what you made?"
//Hmmm. Men's Kimono tend to be dark colors http://www.kimonoguide.com/mens/index.html so what he's seeing is dark clothes and really white hair; maybe he resembles some kind of Japanese monster? Or did he confuse him for someone else? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"It's a Japanese Kimono, isn't it."
//Gratutious English, but "キモーノ" and not the more common "キモノ". Lots of atypical transliterateing 'round Cross Channel. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Also the habits of the Japanese Soseki."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_S%C5%8Dseki (though I can't find pictures of him in anything but the most boring Early Color Period Hollywood brown jacket) + the clothes of priesthood (general), 僧籍 souseki. He's wearing the clothes of a priest in order to get inspired to write the script for his 11AM sermon: now THAT is foreshadowing. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Soseki then... nice pun."
//Making it a bit more obvious given how it's translingual and all. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"You always dress like this?"

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Assuredly."

[Tomoki]
"Awesome."
//Voice doesn't sound all that amazed. -GHS

Seems Tomoki's respect for me has further grown.
This is only the second time I have worn this though.

[Taichi]
"So, what is your purpose this late in the evening?"
//He speaks a little off-period here. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Well... purpose, now, let's say, ah... here, Taichi, your part."

It's a cardboard box.
I receive it.
//Tomoki's box is full of cucumbers. Remember this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's heavy!"

[Tomoki]
"'Cause it's jam-packed."

[Taichi]
"What's inside... it's too dark, I can't see well."
//Even with his eyes? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Your part of the loot from club activities. It's summertime now, so keeping this stuff around is a waste 'cause it just spoils."
//First pass one may be intended to understand he did get it from the club room, or at least, that it's from the same club as Misato. I still believe he just goes 'round the houses and asks people if they have any leftover stuff that's ready to go bad, no need for him to steal anything. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This some sorta food?"

[Tomoki]
"Yep."

[Taichi]
"Oh man, thanks."

[Tomoki]
"It's fine, after all..."
[Tomoki]
"Friendship demands---"

[Taichi]
"Nothing in return."
//Arc words. Or so I would say, but this isn't exactly one of the most developed themes, in the end. -GHS

Tahm!
//See CCA0018B. That changes things a little, considering he was less than sincere in there. -GHS
We laughed fearlessly as we stuck our thumbs up.

[Taichi]
"Kurosu Taichi shall be cheering for you, 『Boy of Pure-hearted Adolescence * Shima Tomoki!』"
//Mostly by calling him a siscon, I guess. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Naaah now."
[Tomoki]
"Ah, right."

His face tightens.

[Tomoki]
"Kirihara... fainted."

[Taichi]
"...bwhaaaht?"
//See CCB0002 and more -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Specifically, she has been fainting."

[Taichi]
"That one is the master of the Harakiri Fist, that even I with my Karade do not expect to make her part with her senses!"
//The word used here means both "to collapse" and "to [be] defeat[ed]" as in a fight. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Not 'fainting' because of that! And that Karade's something incomprehensible, by the way."
//Near what his sister uses, but not quite. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"Anyway... right now Sakuraba's looking after her, but naturally he's useless, so... is Hasekura-senpai available to nurse her?"
//Better question: why doesn't he ask in any other route? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahh, sure."

[Tomoki]
"Could you ask her right away?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I'll be back in a while, yes."
//Suspicious girly affectation. -GHS

I wear my sandals and I head towards her house.
When I returned back, still Tomoki was there.
//Did he even go anywhere? -GHS

[Taichi]
"She said OK. She's on her way already."

[Tomoki]
"...so quick."
//...he just went out and came in, didn't he. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"She only really does what you tell her to, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"If she didn't, there would be many many errors happening all around."
//Hum, this was censored in the PS2 version, not 360. May be related to Eror, see CCA0016. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"So anyway, wanna come in and play a game with the 98 (pronounced 'kyuppachi')?"
//So if Cross Channel is set in 1998, and Taichi has lots of computer terminology set around his split personality, and Tomoki is going to perform a disk change as he plays a game with the 98... it all makes perfect sense! -GHS

That I don't have.

[Taichi]
"You're in charge of disk swap."
//...well, no less than the subject suddenly changing to videogames. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"'98' what? You mean Wi***ws?"
//Japanese edition released July 1998, so he'd know. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mai furendo, what you just told me must be a lie."

[Tomoki]
"...you tryin' to flash kick my thoughts?"
//Captain Tsubasa reference as far as I got, wakashimazu 若島津. Young, island... almost self-referential if so. http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8B%A5%E5%B3%B6%E6%B4%A5%E5%81%A5 Flash Kicker's the most 'official' Western name AFAIC. See CCZAS, there's a callback so I kept it -GHS

Tomoki's gags are all like this.

[Taichi]
"You really don't know the 98?"

When his social class is that of a PC guy!
//Ah, this is also recurring. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Haven't heard about it 'till now at least."
//Now this is just odd, however. A PC user in Japan in 1998 who has never even heard of the PC-98? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...that you would say something like... nah I'm from the wrong generation too, but..."
[Taichi]
"But Tomoki, that utterance right there just made you an enemy of every older PC user born after Showa 40, you get me?"
//1965. I think the point is the same as with Miki having boobs, except it's more troll given what 98 means here. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Nah... I don't think there's annnything to be feared from them now..."
[Tomoki]
"Besides, we can't take care of every single one of those 100% Old Type cavemen born in Paleozoic eras like Showa."
//Curious his first thought is not to how there are no more around, isn't it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"KHHH!?"
//Snake? SNAAAKE! Fucking metal gears... -GHS

I was frightened.

[Taichi]
"YOU CAN'T SAY THAAA〜T!!!"

[Tomoki]
"And why?"

Tomoki is comparatively unaffected by terror.

[Taichi]
"Th-, that's just a thing of youth, right? Right? Reckless youths really are scary, my dear Tomoki!"

[Tomoki]
"'cause you know... wouldn't it be better to put the older men in old men communities where they can keep those discussions about Gun**m that they're so good at spiraling on endlessly?"
//Instead of caring for them one by one. Same term as the post-Showa 40 PC-98 users, so it's basically a direct insult. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!"
//Counting the one inside the 'hi', ぃx14 -GHS

My life expectancy contracted.
IF $loop == 0 RET
//These three lines are only for non-first route. -GHS
And then I remembered.
About last year, around this time,
when Yusa-chan came to visit, on that first day I had worn Japanese clothes.
