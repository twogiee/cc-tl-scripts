Touko was in the classroom.
Faithfully as recorded.
That this gal hasn't got any other place to go other than here, for sure.
She doesn't have strength enough to seclude herself alone at home.

[Taichi]
"Touko, are you eating meals properly?"
//Curiously, it's different from every time he's ever asked. Just a bit, but different. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

She sends me one lone glance, then moves her sight away.
Yet, that mere behavior seems to seclude a countless number of messages.
//Same exact term as above, obviously intentional. -GHS
I don't feel the atmosphere that there would be in being looked askance,
she merely appears to be sulking.
//IOW, this is nothing like CCA0004, is it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha ignore me!"

I pinch her cheeks.

[Touko]
"Stop it!"

Pushed off.

[Taichi]
"But yer ignoring me dammit!"

[Touko]
"Do guess why."

Anger.
That, I knew, was the very first step towards interchange for Touko.

[Taichi]
"Boobnyah!"
//AKA touch on the boobs. -GHS

[Touko]
"STOP! THIS! NOW!"

[Taichi]
"You're early aren't ya. Today's just the opening ceremony, so there's no lessons."
//CCC0014 appears to confirm, perhaps CCC0020 meant "you gotta come, but there's no lessons" with "half-vacation". -GHS

[Touko]
"There's no opening ceremony at all!"
//Notice she doesn't confirm the lack of lessons, and this is perfectly true if the current date and year is simply so that it's not opening day anymore. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You came in your own clothes again."

[Touko]
"I really don't want to wear the uniform of this school, no."

[Taichi]
"How come?"

[Touko]
"Because I'll look stupid won't I?!"

[Taichi]
"Nasty remark that."

It's a misunderstanding.

[Taichi]
"It's just that everybody's 'heads' are not normal, 's all."
//Which brings another interesting thing: everybody's at the School for Abnormals. Everybody also has some sort of superpower. Hmmm. -GHS

[Touko]
"And isn't that the reason why the world would see me as stupid!"
//...but there's no one else... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then, struggle on!"
//See CCC4007? -GHS

[Touko]
"...huh?"

[Taichi]
"When attacks come, how do you defend yourself?"
[Taichi]
"You behave the same as those guys, you behave normally. Not melting in is not gonna work ya know."
//blend into + Touko Is Snow(tm), see CCD3003 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Aren't those the kind of techniques you need?"

[Touko]
"...what's with you talking all serious now? And this early in the morning."
[Touko]
"...besides there aren't any 'others' anymore. So all you're saying is all pointless anyway."
//First and only line in the entire script that asserts this. And it's in reaction not to being seen, but to blending in. Remember that to Touko, "there is no one else" means "no one comes and talks to me". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Are you just going to do nothing like this, every week?"

[Touko]
"Every week?"

Gaffe.
I must deceive.

[Taichi]
"Usage of shan't tied to likelihood of being predestined to becoming an old bag."
//You a newspaper article now? Notice the complete and total nonsequitur. -GHS

[Touko]
"WHAASSS'D YOU SAAAAID?!?"

[Taichi]
"Like that, liiike that."

Can I revitalize Touko by igniting her, as is recommended in the notebooks?

[Taichi]
"Currently your old bag level is 92%, Touko. Being that the average is 25%, it is therefore lethal. Furthermore, as with every year of age accumulated it grows by 1%, you will, before you hit age 30, become thoroughly and perfectly an old bag in body and soul."
//92% = Touko's Conformity Coefficient (46%) times 2, see CCC3021. Difference is sixtySEVEN percent. With the progress, she'd hit 100% in 8 years, at 29 eroge years (25 real years). Interesting he'd double her CC, given how I suspect Alter Egos share CC and therefore Taichi's is double due to Youko not existing. -GHS

[Touko]
"............"

Countdown begins. 3... 2... 1...

[Touko]
"○×△□＄＃％＆○×△□＄＃％＆!!!!!!!!"

She burned, she burned!
The strength to combust will be Touko's strength to live.
...or maybe it won't, regardless, she'll do her best.
I gave her a shout of cheer in my heart of hearts.

[Touko]
"SAY SOMETHIIIING!"
//How long has he been 'out'? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wah!"

Dodged an attack.
Seems to be the propitious time.

[Taichi]
"Byez nooow!"

[Touko]
"Ah, w-, wait up you!"
