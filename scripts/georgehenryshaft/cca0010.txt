I killed time,
//Toootally did not go to class. -GHS
until it became evening.
Is Senpai still around, I wonder?
//Not a bad question considering she sometimes jump. -GHS
The temperature seems to have become more lenient together with the recollections.
//He's totally starting to forget whether Misato was up there. That's the result of those flashbacks he possibly had off-screen. -GHS
The curtain of indigo blue I could see on passing my sight over the rooftop had already dyed back into a brilliant scarlet.
//Supposing it's 6PM. This should be 2AM. -GHS
The squall that was blowing against is gone.
//See CCA0006. Since the wind = the pretense, and Misato is asleep, ergo SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
The time of twilight is as docile as an emasculated cat.
//Taichi, well emasculated from soon after birth, yet struggling with a monster that repeatedly takes the form of his dick, and who can't stand the blood that is evening to the point of hallucinating that the twilasdiujdveSYMBOLISM!!1! -GHS
No one is here.
I search for signs of Misato-senpai.

[Taichi]
"Ah."

Neighboring the stillstanding antenna,

[Taichi]
"There she was."

Sleeping.

[Misato]
"..."

A light sleeper's breathing, regular.
It is something that never transcends the noise that, an unexplainable musicianship along which all thoughts relax.
//See CCA0006. This is far closer to pretty than to purple, but it's still fairly overwrought. And what he's about to do isn't changing. -GHS
Inhale, then exhale, then inhale, then exhale.
A gentle, harmless breath.
Her figure natural in posture, unadorned.
There are no lies there,
filth neither.
All return to a time of purity when they sleep.
//chidlren go 2 heaven -GHS
Motionlessly I stare.
My forcibly stolen said could never be taken back by the mere vividness of the dusk that clads the world.
For so long,
I watched Senpai.
With envy, with longing.

[Taichi]
"..."

For how long did I stay like that?
//Loss of time perception. Still. -GHS
A more vigorous breath the conclusion, her eyelids quivered,
her long eyelashes tremble in a quivering motion,
and the eyes opened, a sliver.

[Taichi]
"...you're really awesome, Senpai."
//Sooo very off tone. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah... eeeh...?"

Her linguistic senses blunted, Senpai had a cherubic voice like a little girl's.
//Matt 18:3. She can return to a child, ergo she can be forgiven. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Good morning."
///sarc -GHS

[Misato]
"...Kurosu... kun?"

[Taichi]
"Peke I am."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun..."

Senpai repeats that nickname that is for her exclusive use.
//Going with this: it'll be even more obvious, later, when Miki starts calling her "Mimi-senpai" as well, as she's not supposed to. -GHS

[Senpai]
"...hn, not nice..."

[Misato]
"Seeing my sleeping face, not nice..."
//Childish -GHS

She writhes slightly, both arms covering the both of her eyes.
//Back to purple: zero need whatsoever to use that OMFG HARD KANJI's for "pair of eyes" here. Or pretty much ever. I'd translate it to "binocular", but I have standards dammit. -GHS
Anyone would want to conceal their most defenseless of appearances.
But the concealment itself means that there are lies in one's normal self.
Is it then the same for Senpai?
...I cast away these cold thoughts.
Before long, Senpai raises herself up.

[Misato]
"How long 've you been there?"
//Not wholly awake. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Just moments."
//Immediate lie... or is it? See CCX0001: hours aren't seconds for him. -GHS

[Misato]
"...hmmm"

A gaze of suspicion.

[Taichi]
"It is the truth."
//As above, it may be. -GHS

I raise both hands and attempt surrender.
//See CCA0006, which is why he did the same there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I would never lie to you, Senpai!"
//Well, deceptions aren't lies, are there. After all, there's no lie about the end of mankind if Taichi is convinced that's true. -GHS

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"But it is a risk not to ensure you do not fall asleep during the day!"
//Misato's sleep patterns are also broken. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Dehydrating or catching sunstroke will put you in serious danger."
//Forget no doctors, since Gunjou doesn't care (under the guise of freedom), nobody'll be there to help her and she'll probably die. To nobody caring. -GHS

[Misato]
"Hmmm, that is right."

She kills a yawn in her teeth.
//Just look at that sentence! Unnecessarily using kanji that require furries for something as simple as a 'yawn', and an apparently simple sentence ("stifling e.g. a yawn") that also means "to bite do death", as well as containing the kanji for 'kill' fairly literally. Ugly in surface, evocative underneath: Touko is known to kill stuff in her mouth, for starters, as well as subject to dehydration (and starvation). -GHS
Her glasses shifted downwards.
Instinctively my hand stretched.
//Everybody dazzled from the big words above, or are you not missing this? See CCA0009B. Fixed existence... -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh...?"

With both hands I seize her glasses and softly return them to normal, close to the face.
//No choice, but he knows his limits. "Return to origin", see below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And there, Senpai as always."

[Misato]
"...really, so dangerous."
//Because she knows he wanted to go for her boobs... or does she? And did he? More below. -GHS

/太一「へ？」

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Misato]
"That part of you is dangerous, Peke-kun."

It feels like she's a little angry.

[Taichi]
"What part? Why?"

[Misato]
"Do look at a mirror and think about this."
//The sentence, silly Misato, means external looks are a reflection of one's internal health, not simply to reflect on one's actions, so she screwed this up bad. This scene is where cross communication really starts, so pay attention. Come the Kiri route... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huuuuh?!"

Bwah, this person here's just said something that makes me cry!

[Taichi]
"Is it because I am horrendooous! Bwaaaaaah, when I worry so much about thaaat!!!"
//The term used is literally "a poor-quality product". Ties well into him being a product of God and all. -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh, that is not what I..."

[Taichi]
"Ugly... I am ugly... mommy..."
//Oddly he generally uses 母 to refers to his mother, this is probably terminology inconsistency. Mother coming out in times of panic is so literally true. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ahhh, you are mistaken, I am telling you that you are mistaken, OK?"
//See CCZAS, this is very similar to her panicking as Taichi goes to "kill" her. Parallel Miki: this is the entirety of his psychotic attacks, and the rest are just him rationalizing them as far worse. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because mommy birthed me ugly..."

[Misato]
"Listen! To! Me!"

[Taichi]
"It is fine, I am revolting anyway. It is just part of the natural order. I am nothing but a gross creep."
//"Bussah" http://www28.atwiki.jp/minaqua/pages/2636.html More of a direct interest that odd thing about his ugliness being "part of the natural order": see CCC4025, consistent with Miki talking about "a Taichi of this world", consistent with the idea that his hideousness - whether murderous impulses or something less - are something that comes from this world, not higher sources. -GHS

[Misato]
"No, that is not... but certainly when we first met you did give me a sort of scare."
//This doesn't quite fit with CCD1001/B, doesn't it. In there, she just walks up to him and talks to him, nothing else. His reply isn't given, however, so maybe he turned her down really nastily. Or perhaps it's just to further the idea that Misato has serious problems expressing herself in a way that's not self-damaging, certainly a callback to the concept of Incommunicability, as mentioned by Thomas Aquinas it is a possible part of--- uhm, that joke about Italian cinema in the '60s and '70s I had here fell off the back and got run over. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

But when we first met you did give me a sort of scare.

[Taichi]
"......"

But when we first met you did give me a sort of scare.

[Taichi]
"........."

But when we first met you did give me a sort of scare.

[Taichi]
"Hah, haWahWah, haWahWahWahWah..."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"GyAhuWaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"
//With the A in 'wa', and ー=a, it's 14xA. -GHS
[Taichi]
"WEEE-OOOH! WEEE-OOOH!" (alarm)
[Taichi]
"Brrr, brrr, BrrRROOOOAM!" (driving sounds)
//See the whole thing about driving. He still goes through trying this before breaking. I think this is a car passing by via doppler effect, see CCZDXC (?). -GHS

[Misato]
"Wah, Peke-kun has entered a weird state!"
//Sorta-softwareish. He did just crash. -GHS

[Taichi]
"WE HAVE NAME CREATOR, WE ARE THE BEING THAT DOMINATES MANKIND!"
//The stupid old ROM wouldn't really accept Western characters unless I hacked the graphics drawing program and had it insert the text manually, which isn't not very elegant due to double-byte characters in the original Japanese (technical hacking stuff, don't mind it), so it read like all centered and with lots of spaces and stuff, but then my editor (which is inexplicably a sock puppet) begged me to use the bootleg that runs on Scramble hardware (MAME joke) so that mere caps are sufficient. Stupid tween who's never been in an arcade in the 80s grumble grumble gitoffmahlawn a fie on both his house and the basement he lives in grumble. -GHS

[Misato]
"Wah, wah, Peke-kun has become an hackneyed Creator of All Life like some boss from a 20-year old videogame?!"
//Beware, he lives! Well, the reference is too vague, I only suspect Sinistar because of tone. Also "I hunger!" works with Taichi the Devourer of All Things (in his mind). The rest is religious, but I don't see how anyone could be stumped by a guy who was likely retrained via videogames and spouts sub-Nietzscheian nonsense at the drop of a hat thinking he's a hackneyed videogame God from the '80s after being struck in a very delicate spot. I mean, DUH. -GHS

[Taichi]
"FOR WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU OPPOSE US? TO EXIST WITHIN OUR CONTROL IS TO OBTAIN PEACE ETERNAL."
//See CCC3013 as well: the final boss of Phantasy Star II fits. Perhaps a conflation of Sinistar and PS2, actually, it would fit very well with Taichi's memory. This question is Jesus in a nutshell. -GHS

[Misato]
"Question!"

[Taichi]
"WHAT IS IT?"

[Misato]
"Why are you speaking in this unnaturally old-fashioned style?"
//Why would Misato even want to know this? -GHS

[Taichi]
"DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM!!!"
//These just imply "sinister atmosphere in progress". ゴx7x2->DOOMx14. -GHS

[Misato]
"Apologies, it is really not a problem!"

[Taichi]
"COMMENCE STARBUSTER FIRING PROCEDURE!"
//Hum, is that something that would cause a star to go nova? http://marathongame.wikia.com/wiki/Trih_Xeem This joke actually ties to how he's supposed to be the cause of all this. It's true if considering this as a parallel universe, literally; it's true in the sense of considering Taichi a Jesus disciple/equivalent; it's true in the sense that it's all a dream, if more hallucinated than anything. -GHS

[Misato]
"E'hy!"
//See CCZAS, CCZDXC. Taichi being fixed via smacking him in the head seems to be a running gag, if not in the story, at least to Tanaka himself. -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'fuh!"
[Taichi]
"...huh, where is here?"
//See CCZDXC again. -GHS

[Misato]
"Oh, good. He returned to normal."
//Compare/contrast scene & words re: her glasses above. Is Misato being hypocritical too? -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's weird..."

[Misato]
"Is there a problem?"

[Taichi]
"I was told something so shocking that I had a dream where I was using the Humanity Annihilation Starbuster Bomb in retaliation... but I cannot remember what was so shocking that motivated me."
//See CCD1001, for starters. This directly connects to his Ultramarine. It's also an example so blatant example of him remembering even when he's forgotten that it's almost too awful to use as a reading key. -GHS

[Misato]
"A bomb that could do that, then..."
//She should also be reflecting on how maybe the end of mankind could be caused by that... but could also be just musing randomly on the bomb that Taichi wanted to fire, as a first-run reader should take it - and a second and third-time reader, given the whole Eyes and Gate thing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah, what was it even..."
[Taichi]
"Peke-kun, you worry too much about appearances. Humanity is in the heart!"
[Taichi]
"Appearances...?"
//Random trigger and... -GHS

Ah, right.
//...an odd understatement if you ask me (and I seriously hope you have at this point)... -GHS

[Misato]
『Certainly when we first met you[r indescribable ugliness] did give me a sort of scare.』
//...remembers. No, wait, he edits memories in near-real time to make things look worse. This is so blatant -GHS

[Taichi]
"OwwwOhOwh..."
//x9??? MADNESS -GHS

[Misato]
"Again..."

[Taichi]
"GERONIMO!!!"

[Misato]
"...who?"
//Someone who fought Mexicans, like, tons(tm). See CCA0006. Someone's being hypocritical I see. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ugh, sigh, sob..."

[Misato]
"What do I do..."

Senpai was flustered.

[Taichi]
"Senpaaai...!"

I tried hugging her (how daring).
//That's why he steeled himself with a cry of Geronimo. -GHS

[Misato]
"...ngh."

Senpai goes on guard, instantly,
both arms wandering in the air.
//Is she reaching out from this loneliness? -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's not-, it's not like I was born ugly by choice... so I'm trying to be virtuous, or clean at least... so I won't make others uncomfortable... sob..."
//清潔 See CCC4003, apparently leaving clean does not mean 'entering' baths. There's no way that first sentence's intended to sound as anything than a negative, but Tanaka has this bad habit of meaning exactly what he says, and there's technically no negative in there sentence. After all, his ugliness was in a certain sense his choice, if we take "his birth" to be the Mansion murders. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ahaaah..."

Slowly, the stiffness departed from Senpai's body.
//fnarr fnarr. -GHS

[Misato]
"Peke-kun..."

I am gently hugged closed.

[Taichi]
"..."

I buried my head in her plump bosom,
submerged it fully.
A sweet bodily odor came through her uniform.
//Smell fetishist, see CCB2009. -GHS
I grow all dizzy.
Just a little scent of sweat, too,
but that, once more, is just oddly fragrant.
And also sooo soff'.
Soffness' without end.
//He's reminded of his URMOM, and he's finally crying in her arms. -GHS

[Misato]
"...ngh..."

To the tickling of my squirmingly moving head Senpai emitted throaty moans.

[Misato]
"Uhmmm..."

My crocodile tears continue.
//It's not because he's not honestly doing this; it's because Taichi Can't Cry(tm) because he's so evil etc. etc. etc. it's totally because he has a backstory where he had to clamp down on his emotions (and I suspect so does the author), see CCE0001, that's where he learned his smile. But if he's faking sincerely, then is it truly faking? -GHS

[Misato]
"I am telling youuu..."
[Misato]
"Set your looks aside, Peke-kun, your eyes are so deep and so pretty!"
//Just like Taichi keeps going and going and going, so does she. She just went and talked about his eyes! You damn idiot, that's his weak spot! This is how similar the two are. -GHS

Hesitation,
however, it scatters in an instant.
//Of course. She doubled down. And this isn't about her apologizing anyway - more specific concepts. -GHS

[Misato]
"...if you suddenly get close to someone, of course their hearts will go all 'badum'!"
//Technically it's just "I get flustered if you get close to me", but see CCB2011: it's nearly what he says to Youko word for word. This is the whole point. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is that true?"

[Misato]
"That is why I told you to look in a mirror, see?"
//Look in a mirror to see someone who likes to get close to people suddenly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"Would you stop crying now, please?"

[Taichi]
"...yes."

I distanced my face with overwhelming sorrow.
When will it even be, the next coming of an opportunity like this?
//Heartrending considering the subtext. -GHS

[Misato]
"But you are so much a crybaby, Peke-kun."
//See CCZAS. So is Youko. Who Taichi sees in the mirror. COUGH COUGH COUGH COUGH. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"You would just burn yourself up without the care of others!"
//Given big themes of the game include both him needing other people's help and stuff burning on fire due to Hell, overliteral is correct. -GHS

But in my heart of hearts my only thoughts are, "burn, buuurn!"
//Like he heard that thing about his looks wrong in his second attempt... interesting considering Witches, see CCD2002. Not the typical moe/burn pun, so nothing there. -GHS
Scooo〜rch!
//I think he's trying to break into silly to avoid the heavy, but on this one I'm not 100% sure. -GHS

[Misato]
"Will you not become a little brother to me?"
//An odd question here. Is she asking him to become like Tomoki? Well, at least Tomoki can drive (eventually), so he's got less problems in that one sense. Or maybe, it's because archaically the word also meant 'apprentice'. Oh who are we kidding here, it's because she totally wants him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes!"

Impulse decision.
//See CCC3019B, same term. OK, this one's weak. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then I entrust myself henceforth in your most capable care!"
//Hyperformal -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"I shall gather my luggage posthaste, and pay visit to Your house."
//See CCB2002, more Touko. -GHS

[Misato]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"For the moment, may I come visit with nothing but what I have on? Siblings there sleep in the same futon, I assume?"

[Misato]
"Ah, uhm, well, Peke-kun..."
//...there's no one in her house. It's totally empty. Her asking Taichi to become like Tomoki to her is at the very least BETRAYAL!!! to him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The truth is, I have been lonely for so long... this young boy thanks you, my nee-san... no, I shall be calling you hime-nee-sama!"
//See CCC0000, Ichiko. -GHS

[Misato]
"Wh-, what do I do..."

So muttered Senpai when faced with this derailing of thoughts.
//See CCA0003, CCA0027; Nanaka and Kiri also have difficulties dealing with these things. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I am joking!"

[Misato]
"..."

And in a flash before my eyes that face changed into an unfriendly look.
//She didn't fail to figure it out; she had good reason to believe he would actually take her seriously. See CCA0025C: it's sort of how her sex scene goes down. -GHS

[Misato]
"PEeKEeKUuN!"
//Hey, eight kanji total with the lines. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I was thinking it would soften things."
//I just can't resist using that there. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...was that... bad?"

I try showing her a face on the verge of tears.
//Echoes first time. He's hoping for another chance at crying. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ngh."
[Misato]
"..."

A sigh.

[Misato]
"Oh you... so unfair!"
//She's weak to the tears of boys. Now put this in the context of CCA0009B. Imitative behavior. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Unfair?"

[Misato]
"Just talking to myself!"

She's sort of in a huff, but,
it seems I'm forgiven.
Because Senpai is so kind.
And while chatting about this and that, soon the night will descend at our backs.
The hours of brightness will end, and we will be visited by the dark.
//闇 That dark, see CCX0001. -GHS
