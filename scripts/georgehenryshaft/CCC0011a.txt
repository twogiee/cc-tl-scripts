There is nobody in the club room.
A room that feels cramped in times of playfulness has the dullness of an off-season when deserted.
On one surface of the corridor-side window, the camouflage was peeling off, leaning inward like a sticked-out tongue.
Photographs of the room interior, deserted, printed landscape and affixed with diligence.
//It's actually never specified how many there are, but since I doubt they have a big enough printer, supposing there's more than one. -GHS
It's something unexpectedly impossible to understand what can be segregated by a single pane of glass.
//Hmmm, see CCA0001 -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

We were always gathering here.
Tomoki always sitting reading a manga.
Sakuraba was here too,
and Senpai as well.
This was a fixed home spot for Miki and Kiri.
//Focusing on the fixed, of course. -GHS
Miyuki... as I recall, she ended up being transferred to Class X quickly after that.
//The "that" appears to be CCB0006, the incident is never seen (it'd probably be too spoilerish since she and Taichi have the same problem). Class X might be "the" Research Building of CCA0022... might not. See CCC3004 -GHS
Her conditions had deteriorated.
Class X is different from the other classes.
It is the final destination for an ultramarine of Gunjou.
But it is yet the happiest of all classes.
//It may be that it implies lobotomy, though since Taichi is likely Class X, it might just be the ones too lost to chuuni. Taichi is very likely there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

The human heart, the human mind, they seem impossible to completely predict.
It's all so damnably normal, but then one day, all of a sudden...
There are those who are said to exist at the limits of the human species.
I do not believe that.
//A denial that the problem is merely genetic. -GHS
...it's a disease.
//LOLICON CAUSES EVERYTHING -GHS
When direct contact with people vanishes, people heal the thirst of their hearts via the media.
//See Touko, but also compare & contrast YMK, where the media also never helps, and the instruments of indirect communication nearly lead at least one character to death. Though this is not simplistic media criticism: it's just about the way it's used, that's why the end Taichi still spreads the message via a media (and why this is a Visual Novel, as well). -GHS
It's as if they never have a proper meal, and instead put nothing in their mouth but harmful chemical substances.
//Especially that kawaii uguu shit that comes from Japan. -GHS
...a complete distortion.
And the result is... this thing here.
                     Gunjou Institute
                    Isolation Facility
              for the Severely Non-compliant
//PC OD. -GHS
Happy students, and burly guards, and permanently stationed therapists and psychiatrists... it was one point of the Policy for the Mitigation of Excessive Profits from the Nuclear Plant to introduce this special education facility.
//The Japanese government stuck these guys with Psychopath High for daring to have too much profit. This is far more controversial than the stuff above about the media. -GHS
"To Heal the Heart in the Heart of Nature."
//See CCA0002. This is what he meant with 'healing as its theme'. It's a bit clumsy like this, but since it's PC-riddled ad copy, it should be sort of snort-worthy anyway. -GHS
That's the official slogan pasted large-font on the advertisement.
But, and everybody knows,
that to heal someone who has a Conformity Coefficient above control value there is but one way:
//This made no damn sense since the CC gets worse as it gets higher. The sentence was rewritten to this in the console versions. -GHS
beneficial contact with people.
In other words,
there is nothing to be had but reciprocal touches.
Would frightened teachers and guards become partners in that, however?
There's no way they would.
There is no choice but for the wounded boys and girls to share hearts and minds with each other.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi?"

Tomoki had come about.

[Taichi]
"Hoy, Siscon."

He gets in a huff.

[Tomoki]
"...not anymore now."

[Taichi]
"Seriously?"

The non-compliant have a tendency to easily embrace hostility or terror for other people.
The former are dangerous characters, the latter pitiable children.

[Tomoki]
"...so you came 'round too, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, seems so. Wanted to know how things were going."
[Taichi]
"You?"

/友貴「同じ」

[Tomoki]
"Same."
[Tomoki]
"There's no classes, 'course, so I got nothing urgent to do."

[Taichi]
"And that new club you talked about before? The Food Procurement club was it?"

[Tomoki]
"Life Maintenance and Improvement Club."

[Taichi]
"Weird name."
//Oddly PC. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"The name's just whatever, ya know."

On Sunday night, on ascertaining the situation, we first of all thought about food.
There, Tomoki suggested gathering the food remaining in the city, and distributing it level-headedly.
//Contrast CCB0022 -GHS
I submitted myself for it, but I was rejected,
//See CCB2006 -GHS
as foodsnatching seems to be strictly forbidden.

[Tomoki]
"Not a job that can be left to a guy that eats several times what normal people do!"

[Taichi]
"But I donn'do that, I told you."
//In'en'ional -GHS

That was a liberty Yusa's mom took...
//See CCA0022. Odd Tomoki'd believe the rumors, but then again, see CCB0006. Then again, what's less stable, that Tomoki'd believe the rumors, or that he'd do so intentionally as a revenge against what Taichi did at a moment so tense and delicate? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"For now, here seems it's all calm."
//HACK moved doll removal to here -GHS

Sitting in his home position, he spreads a map.
//Fixed point theme again -GHS
It's a map of the town.
He goes to draw marks with a red pen.
//Odd, shouldn't he have done this as he went around? Maybe he's consolidating things. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Here there's only dried foods, so it's on the back burner... here there's perishables so..."

Mumbling and muttering while he stares sharp at the map.
And his shape, for an instant, overlapped with that of the Tomoki that read manga.

[Taichi]
"...hahah."

[Tomoki]
"Hm? What?"

[Taichi]
"Nah."
[Taichi]
"It's nothing."

[Tomoki]
"?"

I took some adhesive tape and went to restore the camouflage to order.
An action without meaning,
yet Tomoki did not say anything.
