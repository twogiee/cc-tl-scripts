"Cooo-ming!"
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Who might it be?"

[Yusa]
"Ah, uhm, it's Doujima!"

[Taichi]
"A gangster-like surname associated with a conversely kyute voice... Yusa-chan? It's open, do come in!"
//HACK music starts a sentence later -GHS

Slowly and carefully the door opens, and there stood a beautiful girl.

[Yusa]
"Hello, good eve... ning."

I let her sit, and lay out some barley tea.
We converse on many subjects.

[Yusa]
"Uhm, it's that today would be my birthday."
//WHYYY would you want anyone to hear this obvious miscut thing twice?! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, it was, right."

[Yusa]
"So then, here... a birthday present!"

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm... first of all, thank you. But, uh...?"

[Yusa]
"And also, I thought, so I could hand in the exchange diary tomorrow..."

[Taichi]
"So, first of all your exchange diary, and also, this is a birthday present from me."

[Yusa]
"......"

This young lady has the bad habit of losing words when surprised, don't she.
//HACK lots of new lines to fill some gaps! -GHS
HACK NVL mode -GHS
Maximum permitted dosage exceeded---
//...of each other. -GHS
Yes, therefore,
therefore explanations for the present are best
left for some other time, I thought.
That future opportunity never came.
//This fills a timeline gap, which is when he tried to push down Yusa. Since I suspect that happened because of Yutaka's death, that could well be as soon as one-two days after this. -GHS
As to what use she later made of the wireless
radio I had presented her... I don't know.
//...and as promised in the interview, here's the present. But ah, worry not little thing; in my heart of hearts, you will always be a vibrator. -GHS
This model, which can be acquired comparatively
cheaply, on one hand could be said to be a
wireless radio; on the other hand it's also an
item convenient for indiscriminate radio signal
interception.
//Half of this sentence only exists in the 360 version. This AT LAST makes that sentence in CCA0020 make sense. -GHS
What flies free through the air are proofs
of the connections between person and person.
If one were to catch radio waves at random,
there one would find cellphone conversations, or
calls between radio-equipped transport trucks.
//Last one should be CB. This line came totally out of the blue on the PS2 version. Did Tanaka always just assume people would understand this? Maybe "illegal signal interception" isn't something that's all ages enough for the PS2. -GHS
Those radio monitoring enthusiasts, these people
who find pleasure in engaging in the conduct of
very careful listening to radio signals that here
in Japan takes the name of Wacchi, are not few.
//Cutting here, too low into the screen. -GHS
The reason I am so attracted to Wacchi is... it's
something so listless to think about.
//BTW, compare Youko the stalker. Another tiny subtext is clarified! -GHS
Electromagnetic waves are everywhere and anywhere.
In the sky.
//Until that day... -GHS
An expected existence that one can listen to.
                   However---
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
end new lines -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's see you home."

[Yusa]
"............!!!?!?"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Her loss of words about doubled from before.

[Taichi]
"Well, it's night now, isn't it."
//HACK line removed. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Shall we go?"

[Yusa]
"Ye-, yes!"
//HACK, no that's the evening BG. Better than the day one that they used in CCD1001, but... -GHS

And so, I took her home.
//HACK The sepia doll is obviously the day doll, and they just don't fit here at all. It's possibly why they used these BGs. Sadly there's no darker sepia dolls, so I made them. Time taken: about 5 minutes. Also, different doll. -GHS

[Yusa]
"That question... you just ask me that every time, right Taichi-san?"
//HACK darker doll, and different one too. -GHS
[Yusa]
"That is a bit complicated so I do not really understand but... yes!"
//HACK darker doll -GHS
[Yusa]
"Trainingful then!"

              It is indeed training.
                  Calisthenics.
//Oh dear, adapting. Should now tie to CCA0030, as well as many themes of the story, as likely intended. Except, see CCA0020: this is just her misreading becoming fixed. -GHS
             To reduce homesickness?
//Another homonym, but as the term fits strongly in the religious sense, overadapted. -GHS
                 Not even close.
                    Violence.
                    Violence.
               Training in violence.
          Intense, turbulent, or furious
           and often destructive action.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Ahhh.
I really love those words, don't I!
I laugh so hard within my dream.
//Context is below so didn't go too specific on this. -GHS
Without end.
Mockery.
Sinking sentiments that are quickly swallowed by the abyss.
The plating of a pretension that reminds of the nihility of cynicism dissolves, and the fragments that become bare... gather around the bodies of giant mothers and frolic.
//Reciprocal sexual harassment is well seen in most Nanaka encounters; having a different kind of fun with Yusa's mother, seen again in this route, also matches. Leaving it literal. -GHS
One single thought:
an enemy is an enemy.
If killing needs be, killing it will be.
