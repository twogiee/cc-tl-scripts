The club room.
I was wondering whether Tomoki was here, but it was deserted.
He's working hard at his 'club', I'm sure.
And if he is, right now he'd be downtown.

"...quiet, innit."

When I am alone I understand.
Do things not quiet down this much only when there are no people?
The atmosphere goes transparent, the space gives the impression of vastness.

Serenity.
The bustle of crowds lost for all eternity.
