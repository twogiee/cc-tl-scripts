[Kiri]
"You OK?"
//HACK music straight away -GHS

[Miki]
"...hm... I'm alright..."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

Kiri had wiped off Miki's tears with her handkerchief.
//*cue SonoHana theme* -GHS
Those two are nestled up close.
There isn't any space in between them.
//Symbolism. -GHS
I walk in the lead, with my flashlight.
//This should be dead-black. There should be no way Kiri could see anything, certainly not a body. Except, back in her route... -GHS
Why did Miki want to come here?
Why with the three of us?
And why... was she crying?
...Miki too has lots and lots of baggage, no mistake.
Well, the private stuff is none of my business.
On that, the hokora was close to here wasn't it.
Should I just give a quick look?
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri, there's this place I'd like to drop by just a bit, so..."
//Don't forget to make it sound vaguely sexual so she'll misunderstand. -GHS

I hand over the flashlight.

[Taichi]
"Welll see ya."
//HACK Miki should rightfully be crapping her pants now. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh... ah, wait!"

[Miki]
"Ah, over there's... danger..."
//A blond loli that built a trapped area up a mountain. Ever heard that one before? -GHS

And then I,

[Taichi]
"I finally larrived."
//The literal one is wrong due to ranuki kotoba which is uhmmm you either know or you could likely not care less, so look it up if you really want to. Let's just say it's about removing 'ra' from verbal forms, which, Research (AKA a little googlin') indicates that it's more typical of typo or misuse for affectation than a proper form. -GHS

I expressed my strong feelings by unnecessarily making a word start with "la".
//The difficulty with adapting 'ranuki kotoba'? See CCZAS, where all the "ra" that Taichi removes end up. ...I sort of wish I was kidding, but no, that's exactly it. This won't be the first reference to the cut scenario, by the way. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Gh'yah!"

My ankle bent. I go tumbling down.
Instantaneously I latched onto a nearby tree branch the Lupin Wire built into my belt... or that's what I'd do if I was that clever, and instead fell down normally.
//As in Lupin the Thief. -GHS
At times like this, just up and falling down is best.
//HACK shake screen. -GHS
Ukemi.
//See CCC0003B... oh, whoops, now that was replaced. Which is actually a big problem: this is Taichi falling and possibly hitting is head, like he does in CCC0003A and B - right before he sees Youko. Both those changes are new to the console version, making this extraordinarily suspicious. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

I look very very close to the ground as I move.
//よくよく -GHS
Footprints.
A straight line of footprints from the front of the hokora, overlapping, forming a belt shape.
//GISing the term 帯状 comes with a SERIOUS WARNING. -GHS
This is what would happen when you go around and around many times.
//This one's just rubbing it in reader's faces. -GHS
I investigate one of the shoeprints.
Size is around 27.
//http://www.i18nguy.com/l10n/shoes.html there's no male size 27, but the "around" means it's not important. It's closer to a typical Western male size. Nice to see the comparisons: Europe size 43 (7), Mexican size 7, UK/US/Austrialia size ~8. Ah, is that why things look like 8 to American Taichi, but are 7 for the Japanese Sakuraba? That's a bit reaching, but the idea that Tanaka consulted these same charts when deciding this detail isn't exactly unbelievable. -GHS
Same as mine.
Brand and model too, I would say.

[Taichi]
"......"

Same shoes as mine.
These are not Tomoki's shoes.
They are not Sakuraba's either.
I can't really believe a woman would be a size 27.
//From what little I can find, typical female Japanese shoe size ought be closer to half that. -GHS
I have a firm grasp on all members' body data, therefore I can say that with no mistake.
//Creepy stalker. Just like Youko! -GHS
Perhaps by me with memory loss, perhaps by someone using my shoes, but somehow these shoeprints were made.
//Notice the lack of Youko or Miki footprints. Youko, OK, she's a ghost; Miki set up the traps. Her footprints MUST be there, period. More importantly, his first idea is memory loss... see CCC0007 -GHS
But to do what at the hokora?
I tried to immerse myself in thought---
//HACK Cornholio must've been here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...!"

I caught a whiff of blood,
a faint smell of blood.
//His sensitivity to the smell was established in CCC4007... and nowhere else. He can't smell Kiri's menses, or most oddly, the blood(?)stain in the corridor. -GHS
Pulling myself towards it, I force my way into the thicket.
Immediately a warning signal sounded.
//see CCC0006A, CCC3002. That worked well in the past, didn't it? -GHS
I took out the knife from the Taichi bag.
It was a large Chris Reeve knife.
//See CCC3019A, CCC3022. Maybe Youko bought two, or maybe there only ever was one. Or maybe, as with Kiri and Miki, it's just catspeak. -GHS
Large to the point where it is close to a dagger.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Reeve_Knives One Piece range goes up to 23cm, which is indeed big. "Dagger" might refer to many things: the † mathematical symbol, the cross, Taichi (name and physique, see CCZRooftop)... curiously, I can't source any name connection between the few types of Chris Reeve knives and Taichi. Or Youko. I'm not even sure what model this would be. -GHS
Of course carrying it is a crime, but,
//Term used for 'carry' of gun etc, ownership is below. -GHS
the very concept of crime was no more.
//See CCA0021 -GHS
I am also forbidden from being in possession of it,
//Likely same as Kirihara and her own sword, with which she can't train. -GHS
but,
even if it won't be recognized, this is something I need for my own protection.
//I strongly suspect that this is a diatribe on how individual weapon ownership should be unrestricted, even to those people classified as dangerous - "shall not be infringed". It'd still be less controversial than YMK is regarding the management of bullying (which, I remind, is not merely to humiliate/murder them, but to dump public school and its useless unhelpful teachers). -GHS
Because I know the horror of being repeatedly attacked by people.
//The only person ever heard of explicitly attacking Taichi outside of the Mansion is Sakuraba. But let's go with paranoia. -GHS
I strained my ears.
I make the perceptions sharper.
//HACK whatever you please... -GHS
I walk slowly.
The only thing I can search for is the sense of physical discomfort.
//There's that term again. -GHS
Found it.
That sense of physical discomfort will never escape from my eyes.
//If the sense of physical discomfort is something that doesn't exist, then what IS he finding? -GHS
I prudently walk around it, to near the tree roots.
...a crossbow trap?
It uses a very small crossbow.
This would trigger on anyone trying to go any deeper.
It's not yet been fired.
//This seems to be the only one. Of course it isn't necessarily the case, but... -GHS
I happen to know of only one person with the personality trait to do this sort of thing.
Disconnect the wire, remove the bolt from the crossbow.
It was fairly cautiously concealed.
Setup location is also skillful.
Just in front of the tall step of the hokora, barely visible.
//Same term used for the hokora's steps, though I remain fundamentally unconvinced it is necessarily the same since there's no direct reference to the hokora around here. -GHS
If I gone to the step without paying attention, I would have been dead.
That's reliable hunting trap, malicious in intent.
How about ascertaining what's back there, then, Youko-sensei?
I advanced a bit, and found a wire trap laid out.
It's a snare. If feet tripped it, a rock would fall from overhead.
//That's nearly insanely elaborate. -GHS
Disarmed.
The warning signal waned.
Does this mean there's no more?
//The only time the warning signal ever comes for anything is for Nanaka smacking into him and Miki trying to 'bow him. The first he can never avoid and is 100% not real, the latter may well be not real as well. Whatever's happening here can't be what it looks like. -GHS
I proceed warily nevertheless.
//Well, you did give love a bad name. -GHS
HACK earlier CG -GHS
I come out of the last bush and there, as if she were concealed, Youko-chan had died.
//Let's say she wasn't concealed by someone. Let's. Regardless, she should not be visible from far away. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

What description could I even use for the emotion I have.
It is different from shock.
It is different from anger.
Nor is it sadness, nor even grief.
A torrent of something I can't describe,
that swirls inside of me into an eddy.
//That recurring term. Perhaps what he's seeing is literally nothing. Miki acting weird because she doesn't play the game correctly + Youko not coming because of his confession last week which made her less... prominent + the hallucinated (see term) traps. -GHS
Youko-chan... had died.
Blood spread into the center of her chest.
//Well, she gave love a bad name, so there. -GHS
It is stale blood.
it's clumped and solidified, its color changed, darkened.
I touch. Cold.
Days after death. Rigor mortis it seems.
//Rigor disappears in up to 60 hours, it seems, so if she died Monday morning it's just barely within that window. -GHS
However, there's no trace of decay.
//Remember: there's no decay in food because it's delivered fresh over and over, so... -GHS
That is also so very strange but... well, I'll set that aside.

[Taichi]
"...so you died after all, Youko-chan, did you."

I talk to this beautiful husk.
But she should have been the furthest from death.
//She's the closest to perfect... she's the first to die. -GHS
I straighten her hair.

[Taichi]
"Careless weren't you."

Yet there is no reply.
//Oh, just like normal then! -GHS
When I spoke to her, she was happy like a little animal.
//Maybe she IS a cat. -GHS
Even though I was cruel,
she was just like a tiny little rabbit.
...truth is, she had become more like a lion or a big bad wolf.

[Taichi]
"What a surprise."
//HACK pixelate -GHS

My sight clouded.

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

I try touching the outer corners of my eyes.
Tears,
and plenty of them.
There is no sadness,
just a cramp of the muscles of the face, that squeeze out tears,
//Sure, like there wasn't for Touko in the previous route! What blatant lies. -GHS
without end.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, 'mazing... they're coming out all rain-like!"
//Annnd attempts to kill the mood. -GHS

Inexplicable.
The flesh appears sad, or something, I'm not sure,
but the heart...
Ahhh.
Half of my body had died.
//I guess this is the death of Taichi Of This World. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...Senpai... you..."
//HACK earlier line & SFX. Now this is odd: Youko's body is hidden, it's the dead of night, and it's a grove in the mountains. She came close enough to see Youko, but not enough to see the huge bolt wound? It's astonishing she can see Youko at all! Less mysterious is what made her come: Miki. The most amusing bit of irony, however, is that this is what makes *Kiri* mad, not Taichi. -GHS

KIRI!!!
//HACK sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

And Miki too.
//Who knew of this back on Monday, Tuesday at the latest. The only way this makes sense is if she was certain this would make Taichi flip out, and wants Kiri there to ensure she and Taichi duke it out. Which makes metasense given that the Hero and the Dragon need to fight, if only on a misunderstanding, to hopefully reconcile later... but Miki forgets her tropes: that usually happens when fighting the Man Behind The Man, which'd be HER. -GHS
Concealing my knife at once... is meaningless.
I was already seen.
And then... likely misunderstood.

[Kiri]
"Mur-... murderer... I knew it..."

I knew it.
//Repeating what Kiri said + he knew Kiri would mistake this -GHS

[Kiri]
"Are you the killer?"
//Very interesting she doesn't ever mention Youko by name, isn't it? What the hell is she seeing? ...is she even seeing anything at all? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...no I'm not!"

[Kiri]
"But isn't that a knife in your hand...?"

[Taichi]
"I had to get through the ticket, that's why I do, no other reason."
[Taichi]
"Look, come and see her wound. It's an arrow shot."
//Leaving it for simplicity's sake. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I will not be going... not there."
//She'd just say he had a crossbow and was about to dismember her with the knife anyway. -GHS

Making a wide circle at a distance,
//I don't think one person can surround another... though, hmmm, penis and vagina... hum, hum... -GHS
Kiri was observing me intently.
She has no intention of letting her guard down.

[Kiri]
"...just until now... you were smiling and talking and then... but out of sight, you were doing this, in cold blood..."

She spat at me.

[Kiri]
"You are insane!"
//HACK no need -GHS

[Miki]
"......Senpai."

Miki also seems to have been shocked.
Regretful and tormented over this. That's what her face said.
//Same term as the end of CCA0027. If that dash is real, what did she learn from it? Certainly she's not tormented over Youko's death... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki."
//"Well, we witnessed a murder. There's a guy with a knife like right behind us. I'm sure nothing's gonna happen if we, the only witnesses, just up and walk away." Kiri is the brains of the group, no doubt about it. It's more likely this is intended to mean that she doesn't believe this at all. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, yes..."

The two retrace their steps,
leaving me behind.

[Taichi]
"But that wasn't me."

Oh, whatever, who cares.
Youko-chan had died.
Unexpectedly, I too seem to have struck with a big impact.
My thoughts were lax and aimless, and would not allow me a quick or ready return to clarity.
And that... was the lamentation I held for her.
