"...well then."
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
HACK rooftop zoom -GHS

Mid-morning, when the temperature is still not so high,
I come to the rooftop, alone.
It's mid-morning.
I expect Senpai will turn up in the afternoon.

[Taichi]
"Then,"

I decided to set about work, one step ahead of her.
First of all, the heavy labor.
Even I could do it, as long as it's just bringing in the heavy stuff.
//HACK fade to black -GHS
...
......
.........
I had come to the rooftop carrying equipment,
and ran across Tomoki.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi... right."

Seemed startled.

[Taichi]
"Did you come to join us in our club activities?"

[Tomoki]
"...that'd be, well."
//Going with indecisive, if only because he's easily convinced below. ...which makes his betrayal odd, I know. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Senpai seems very worried you know."

[Tomoki]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"She seems to be taking in adequate amounts of stress."
[Taichi]
"And that'd be due to family matters right?"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"If she's acting so madly on her own, that's gotta be the cause."

[Tomoki]
"Mad you call it..."

[Taichi]
"Running away, then?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

A stern face.

[Taichi]
"...well, it's only a problem between you guys, but... honestly, not even wanting your help, that's harsh."
//On both of them. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...back at'cha, Taichi. Why are you even helping?"

[Taichi]
"Well, it ain't like I got anything else to do."
[Taichi]
"Because... what we're doing here, I think it's important for us."

I lay the equipment on the long table.
It requires wiring.

[Taichi]
"Dammiiit, I just got no idea here."

[Tomoki]
"...what'cha doing now."

[Taichi]
"'Wow, the work has progressed this much, Peke-kun sugoi!, Prezy super deeply moved, Prezy sooo wet, kissy-kissy!'... or words to that effect. That is my goal."

[Tomoki]
"Prezy-kiss ain't happening though."
[Tomoki]
"Club activities?"

[Taichi]
"Yeppy yep."

Languidly Tomoki sits on the bare ground.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, thank ye."

Canned juice.
Wasn't particularly cold, though.

[Tomoki]
"...Taichi, why all this enthusiasm?"

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, it's Seriously Questioning Adolescent flavored!"

[Tomoki]
"That don't seaweed into sense."

[Taichi]
"Hyyyper funny, that joke."

[Tomoki]
"...why activities now?"

[Taichi]
"I have one question, if I may."

With a straight face.

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"It's about... you and your nee-san, however. Can I?"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"It's a serious question!"

[Tomoki]
"...OK. What?"

[Taichi]
"Well,"

With a little nervousness I push out the question.

[Taichi]
"How come you're from Kanto but you drop in some fake-Kansai accent in your sentences?"

[Tomoki]
"That's the single most unrelated question to Aneki!!!"
[Tomoki]
"I'm leaving..."

[Taichi]
"Waiiit, waiiit, gladden me with holding on! Romance wasn't built in a day!"

[Tomoki]
"Thank you for making me waste some time, Taichi-kun."

[Taichi]
"Don't become so cynical!"
[Taichi]
"I mean this thing here! Come on, isn't having an objective the way to gaining something to live for?"

[Tomoki]
"...something to live for, huh."
[Tomoki]
"But once you have food to live, that'd be good to have, though."

[Taichi]
"And this is the sort of thing that I have been longing for."

[Tomoki]
"This, what?"

[Taichi]
"Vitelloni Graffitea."
[Taichi]
"What flavor do you think that has?"

[Tomoki]
"Nah, that ain't a tea."

Tomoki gets up, and walks around the perimeter of the antenna.

[Tomoki]
"With this... just with this thing?"

[Taichi]
"Well, if you have something to do yourself that's fine too."

[Tomoki]
"...to do, hmmm. Not really. Looking for goods and materials, maybe."

[Taichi]
"At least in these club activities there is some hope."

[Tomoki]
"This could do nothing but confirm that it's hopeless, ya know?"

[Taichi]
"Then there is the hope that we can confirm that it's hopeless."

[Tomoki]
"...I just don't get the way you think, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Dooon't you nooow?"

[Tomoki]
"Why're you looking like you're having fun now."

[Taichi]
"Hehheh."

[Tomoki]
"Really, you're unbelievable."

Tomoki wiped his undereye with his arm.

[Tomoki]
"What I know is... just how to wire this antenna to the mobile equipment."

[Taichi]
"Then help you whelp!"

[Tomoki]
"What's with that, at least look a little like you're emotionally moved or something!"

[Taichi]
"D-dummy, my heart of hearts is crying, baka! Wailing, baka! This is the utsuge route!"

[Tomoki]
"None of that I can seeeã€œ."

[Taichi]
"But it's corny to get all tearful with males! Go trigger that event with your nee-chan, you bastard!"

[Tomoki]
"Nastyyy!"

[Taichi]
"Well, if that's your decision then get to work you whelp! Broadcast's scheduled for tomorrow ya know."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, yeah."
[Tomoki]
"Well, I'll go bring up the equipment."
//HACK stray empty line removed, same as CCA0029. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"...Taichi?"

A leg inside the school building, Tomoki stops.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Tomoki]
"...I thought you would tell me to put things right with Aneki, for sure, that a younger brother should help his Aneki."

[Taichi]
"Naaah, sibling quarreling's a very respectable way of life it is. Don'tcha stop."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Basically this is about you helping the greatness that is I."

Puff that chest with pride!

[Tomoki]
"...what're you a VIP."

[Taichi]
"After all, I am the Overlord of all those of Conformity Coefficient 80 and Over."

[Tomoki]
"...and I will still be this Overlord's normal friend from now on."
[Tomoki]
"Because... I don't hate that of you."

He quickly vanishes inside the school building. As if running away.

[Taichi]
"'Iiii don't haaate that of youuu'... pffft!"

After Tomoki had said that, his face had instantly reddened up to the physical blushing limits of mankind.

[Taichi]
"If it makes you embarrassed then don'tcha say it! Seriously."
//HACK sky -GHS

I look up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"But with this, we're a little on the way aren't we."

Fun pretend-a-club-activities.
They may become precious memories.
For the sake of one day having that fun dream---
//Second line split below as per CCA0029 -GHS
Certainly.
Forever.
For the sake of thinking... thank you.
//HACK fade to black -GHS
I will be fighting.
//Assuming this is an older revision for hopefully obvious reasons. -GHS
