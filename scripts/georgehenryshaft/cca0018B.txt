"W-, whoa, there must be the will of someone preposterous mediating in that location."
//God, of course, although first read is intended to be read that Taichi thinks it a miracle Yutaka has an Imouto-like being to him. Instead, it's about the miracle it'd take to turn someone like Yutaka into someone who'd be able to live with Kiri without making mincemeat of her. -GHS

"'That'?"

"For the outwards she's fine for sure, but, after those weak points tear through that nice and clean, I can't really think of 'er as something pretty can I?"

Ero LN banzai.

Not much of a big deal.
How the guy who said this will be shown to have Taepodong-class knothole eyes will become clear afterwards.
//It's indeed the missile, which fits into the Nations of the World thing - "he has rockets big enough to threaten Japan", except it's not a sexual metaphor (somehow). but this refers to a type of creepy dolls called 'murder dolls' (殺人人形), who have eyes like knotholes. Chucky from Child's Play seems to be among the most popular, curiously. This ties to Taichi's backstory as a human doll, automatic behavior, Taichi's own eyes, and more. -GHS
