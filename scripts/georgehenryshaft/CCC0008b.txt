I stayed like this for a while, but soon I got tired of my rectangular self.
//That's a parallelepiped, not a rectangle. Ah, well, he's 2D anyway. -GHS
I could feel absolutely no abnormality in the interior of the hokora.
//Same term as CCC0007 -GHS
However, certainly, the flow of time here is strange.
Perhaps more correctly, next to the hokora it is wholesome, while it's around the town that it's strange.
//"Wholesome" is generally used to indicate activities that are correct, healthy, sound, and "human" in general. Of course it's no coincidence. -GHS
For now I come out,
//HACK back to normal hokora -GHS
and return the notebooks inside.
Information is precious.
The more information there is here the better it is.
Even if me as I am right now were to be reset, for example, Youko-chan will have good chances to be able to determine the facts of the hokora every time.
//HACK Typo in the script fixed in the console version -GHS
If she looks at the notebooks, she could likely reach in a single instant a final word of the same level as the one I, as I presently am, just thought up.
//Curious he's using 'final word' now, see CCC0007... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...right, that uniform then."
//HACK wow, what a luxury for a script maybe 10 people who've ever read this even know about. -GHS

Nanaka's uniform.
It's a design I have never seen.
This will be a hint.
//The sailor uniform-ish design, like the buruma, speaks of a character that's been out of date (perhaps dead) for a long while. -GHS
Meeting her again might not be necessarily possible.
There is the choice of searching for this Nanaka, but,
I do not expect that that design would be published in the school uniform reference books that I own.
//They're porn. -GHS
No-ope, that wouldn't be in that reference book, therefore...
//HACK and out -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dunno."

Let's just put this on hold.
Supposing there is a next encounter, then I will just have to interrogate her.
//And ask her the color of her panties. He's remembering! -GHS
So then,
To school, then?
For the time being, it is expected of me to write in the diary how I spend my everyday.
That's all that I could do, I thought.
