"I know you can't really stomach it, but couldn't you try coming to Club starting tomorrow?"
//"Stomach it" heee heee me so crubler- clevsder- cruller. Mmmh hungry nau. What were we talking about again? -GHS

[Touko]

Her emaciated features turned a bright scarlet, and left me with an impression in some respects tragic.
