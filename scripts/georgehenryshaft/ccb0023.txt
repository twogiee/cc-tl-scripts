Twang, then the feeling of my body being pushed through.
//He then speaks of blood falling down below his feet, so I don't think he collapsed yet. The entire following is probably no more than a few seconds anyway. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ngh."

Of course. I thought.
Oddly I have completely understood.
A single bolt was piercing my chest.
Of course.
Of course of course.
I have definitely moved, indeed,
and then I was shot by Kiri.
Truly easy to understand.
???: "******!!!?!?"
Who's even that.
Is somebody even worrying about me?
Senpai maybe?
Touko maybe?
Miki maybe?
If it's Sakuraba or Tomoki... that'd huuurt.
Sorry. Me die now.
I could not uphold... the Oath of the Peach Garden...
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_the_Peach_Garden see CCD0001 -GHS
Wait, I broke that from the start haven't I.
Hahahah.
Hahahahah.
I wanna laugh but no voice comes out.
//He wants to laugh x7 but he can't. -GHS
From the center of my chest, a foggy oppressive sensation fills my heart.
//SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
On looking at the pit of my stomach, the blood I've spilled dampens me down to my feet.
//There's no indication he's thrown up, plus most of the blood would still come from the wound so I decided it's not literal! Truly no one can stop me. -GHS
Maaan this is trouble.
This looks very bolt, I'll die for real.
//ya-bai, whereas ya=arrow/bolt -GHS
But I don't wanna die!
I wanna live so so very much!
And I wanna do lots of pervy things, and I wanna watch the TV, and I wanna see a real conclusion to manga serials.
//Pffft, a manga ending. Fat chance right. -GHS
Not nice, huh, getting the shaft and dying.
//Ya-da (seriously stop that) -GHS
Ahhh, but me's a Young Adult Cadet so I'll just come back to life by the power of a miracle or something won't I.
//Less funny considering it's pretty much literally true. -GHS
My spoils shall be hugged and cried upon by a beautiful girl, and the instant one of her tear touches me, boom!, a brilliant white light and suddenly I will be revived.
So emotional innit.
So, for now, what sketch should I force myself into here on the edge of death?
//I'm guessing those were the above arrow puns. -GHS
That's the cool thing for a man to do.
Because I can't talk, and I can't take much in the way of movements... I can't do anything particularly flashy.
Wait, then I can't do nuthin'!
//It's not a double negative because of science. -GHS
Bwaaah, do I just have die like this! That's waaay bad!
//Sparing yet another arrow pun here. -GHS
Someone make a metal pan fall on my heeead!
//Generic Slapstick Comedy (tm) -GHS
Laugh, please, laugh at me!
D'wah, blood's nasty innit!
It's spread lots more than before. I'm just one big stain of blood now.
Can all this blood be spilled from a human being alone? ...this one's deep.
//the wound and that sentence. -GHS
It's all red.
I can recognize the color, meaning I still gotta be as I am.
Have I Returned at this very last moment?
Mh-hm.
That'd be nice.
Unexpectedly, the feeling returns from the neck up.
//Probably where he's injected with a sedative to bring him to the infirmary so he can recover from this panic attack he's having. -GHS
It's gotta be temporary.
Muscles all around have recovered from this state of shock.
...but I have to add, that's not likely to last.
Awareness has already grown indistinct,
breathing is unnaturally shallow and elaborate as well.
I can't even tell if I'm in pain.
I looked up and, ahead,
//Kiri and Misato are very visible. The one on the left has trousers, so it's either Sakuraba or Tomoki. Hand in the lower left must belong to someone not onscreen due to position, and looks male. Youko is onscreen, Taichi's the POV. Touko has a distinct dress and shoes, and provided she isn't that hand on the left, isn't onscreen at all. The last pair of female legs on the right can only be Miki's. It's not impossible for either Tomoki, Sakuraba or Touko to not be dead in that screen, but Miki has to be. -GHS
the red had been spreading, everywhere, anywhere.
....it's done, I thought.
//I refuse to do another arrow pun. -GHS
That instant I died.
