"Well then, about time I went home."

[Misato]
"Ahhh, yes it is."
[Misato]
"It is a suitably right time."
//So nasty in retrospect. -GHS

[Taichi]
"When it's dark you go to sleep, when it's light you wake up."
//See CCD5001. This doesn't necessarily mean "there's no more artificial light". -GHS
[Taichi]
"A human worth the word would want that life, right?"
//This is sorta old-fashioned. Reconnecting to the above, it makes even that volitional, so still no sell. -GHS

[Misato]
"It is, yes it is."
[Misato]
"Well then, let us conclude club activities for today with this."

A natural thing, that.

[Taichi]
"Shall we not go home together?"

[Misato]
"Our ways are opposite, are they not?"
//See CCA0011A, though this seems to have more of a lateral meaning. -GHS

[Taichi]

//IOW, she knows Taichi is sort of a predator. -GHS

With a reproachful glare.

[Taichi]
"I shall be rewoofing my presence, then."
//The subtext is "piss off, signed: Misato", and he totally knows. -GHS

I had no choice but to withdraw dejectedly.
But in exchange for that,
until I had completely vanished inside the building, Senpai saw me off with a waving of the hand she set right in front of her chest.
//Because boobs. Nah, it's more of a "d'awww she likes him". -GHS
Heart goes 'badum'.
//Good, bad, this sentence is ambiguous(tm). -GHS
