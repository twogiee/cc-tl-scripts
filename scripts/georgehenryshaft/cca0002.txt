The world is beautiful.
//This is difficult to see in the low 640x480, but fiddling with the lights in the 800x600 Reprint edition data shows the town is much more detailed than it seems here. I suspect it's a photograph. Curiously, from this vantage point, the school should be visible right below. -GHS
Every time I pass my gaze over the town from up here, something that must be very wrong inside makes me think so.
//Yet, that "very wrong thing" is not necessarily his ultramarine; that he finds the world beautiful despite everything is something he can hang on to. More curious that "every time". How many times has he been here now? -GHS
But when something is beautiful there are no ways to deny it.
//Shoganai will be consistently rendered as "no ways to", see CCX0001 for reason. The Shoganais are rare compared to the Shikatanais, possibly intentionally to remind of the ending. Well, both are rare, maybe they're just too bland for the author. -GHS
It's the lush atmosphere of Summer,
so gracefully elegant that to describe it in a few words is to disappoint it.
Those are the feelings that the view from this ridge always arouses in me.
From the break between the quietly breathing trees one could see a flock of white buildings, isolated from the outside world by mountains.
//flock=gun, same 'gun' as in 'gunjou', see also CCC3025 for more. -GHS
It's a town.
A brand new, pure, immaculate, and quiet suburban
city... 's rear end.
In short, this is just the appendix.
//see what I did there -GHS
If one is looking for the main body of this city, it lies on the opposite side of these incredibly steep mountains.
Speaking of this other side, there's department stores, and if one takes the time, the routes that lead to the city center will lay at one's feet rental shops of course, and game centers, and book stores, and even "health services" shops.
//They're "massage parlors". Those are not scare quotes; they are an actual part of the name. And they will play a part, however weird, in the VN. Most famous ones are PeachLand and MateBook. -GHS
There it lies, the over-ripened fruit of a civilization that welcomes the heights of appetite.
//Appetite, see CCA0021 -GHS
Alias a City.
//Capitalized, will be referred to this later. -GHS
So then, about this side.
There's residences, and mountains of them.
Also mountains, and mountains of them.
//badum-tish. -GHS
And there's also a school. Just one, and no more.
//Important, since all other students must necessarily go to the school on the other side of the mountains (by train), ergo Nanaka can't go to another school on this side. -GHS
As for other things that jump to the eye, there are only the things of nature perhaps.
Those people who work like horses, carrying on their days with the leftovers of the city they manserve, are here welcomed, sent off, occasionally brought into the world (adult joke #1), and put to very sound sleep at night.
//Curiously a hospital is never ever mentioned. -GHS
In other words, it's more of a dormitory than a proper town,
//I'll try to only tweak terms if they don't google to something relevant. This is particularly interesting for one reason: somehow Mutsumi lives in a dormitory, leaving Taichi unattended for days at an end... but the town itself is all but a dormitory. Very odd. -GHS
despite being the same township.
Seems there are some deep political circumstances.
According to the map, the majestic mountain ridges that cleave this territory in two are labeled hills.
//The mountains are religion, specifically Christianity, and the politicians (AKA those Of The World) call religion a small trifling little thing; a hill. And then Christianity is curry and therefore the message of Cross Channel is that politicians think mountains are curry. That doesn't seem too unlikely, by the way. -GHS
However you look at it, that is no sweet little affair.
Taking the word of the map literally and mistaking them for a hill, someone who's planning a wife-and-my-son hiking trip or something will then be met with a guaranteed family-wide stranding.
//See CCC4016, CCX0001. The father taking up religion will involve the family; son against the father, daughter against the mother, brother against brother. -GHS
Means of transportation in and out of town are a train and an unpaved mountain trail, nothing else.
Technically, if you go towards the opposite ridge, there is a road.
//Far western road, beyond the bridge. That's where Kiri'll go practice, and parts of CCZAS are there. -GHS
However, in truth you'll just end up detoured.
There's little more than a length of pointless distance.
//There are two ways out of this town: the train (which doesn't run for him), and the tiiiny little road that passes by the only religious building in the whole world. The alternative is something that looks like a road, but just makes you run in circles. -GHS
'Tis but countryside.
//Randomly formal. See CCZAS, where Taichi lives on the far western side, in the wilderness, because he thinks himself an animal: there is no exit down that road. -GHS
Some time ago, this guy Sakuraba from my class said:
//HACK superimposed Sakuraba, serious face, with screen dim -GHS

[Sakuraba]
『I will prove myself by conquering the peak with this new bike. Because... I think that's what I need to do for my sake, right now.』
//HACK vanish Sakuraba -GHS

And so he left for his journey, all while his teeth shined.
Then,
it came that Sakuraba did not return home for three full days, so that the police was formally dispatched.
//See CCC3025. Same time! -GHS
He'd sounded like he was trying to take the mountain bike he just bought for a little test ride.
//On the useless 'scenery' of the mountain trail of the West, above. -GHS
But, getting carried out in the moment, he had a breakdown after getting to a point about five kilometers from the neighboring town of Aihara City (hyper far away).
//Keeping 超 consistent as it seems a bit of a running gag. The bike will take you far, but not everywhere on its own. A "Aihara" seems to exist, dunno the point of it. -GHS
He was midway through his rout, on a mountain road with little traffic, when he was caught in flagrante delicto and taken into custody.
//Wonder how many will try to correct that to 'route'. -GHS
Sakuraba's family is very overprotective, like the family of the about equally rich classmate Kirihara.
They get called Sakurabas of the West, and Kiriharas of the East.
The Kiriharas are of warrior lineage, and their daughter also has the stern air of the aristocrat's daughter.
//Leaving literal because Taichi is the Aristocrat of Love. -GHS
Her relatives to a one have these sour faces as if they were chewing bitterbugs, the abusive language to match, and on the overall they are devoid of love.
//Tsundere runs in the family, IOW. -GHS

[Common nickname]
"Harakiri".

But the Sakuraba family was the complete opposite, a household of placid gentleness. His father had even accomplished the Feat of Arms of having voyaged to the brink of death by ignoring the pain of his appendicitis.
That spontaneously adventurous spirit would certainly see a worthy successor in his son.
It was funny to see a chink in the Sakurabas' naturally mellow nature when, in the dead of night, said son still had not returned and they anxiously stampeded off to the police shouting "he has been kidnapped!".
The authorities reprimanded Sakuraba to the fullest, and his bicycle was impounded.
//As a Gunjou student attempting escape from the open-air prison, he was lucky. -GHS
And what's more, he became the laughingstock of the school.
He kept monopolizing the top spot of the front page of the school newspaper for a long time.
Particularly, the specifics of what he said as he let his mouth run off during the interview made the rounds all around.
//HACK superimposed Sakuraba, laughing face, with screen dim -GHS

[Sakuraba]
『Urgent newsflash! In the deep lands of Hasugatake, a mysterious man-made structure was sighted!』
//Hasugatake ("The Lotus' Magnificence") is similar to Hasugaike http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%93%AE%E3%83%B6%E6%B1%A0%E9%A7%85, and nothing else returns. Place is straight in the middle of Miyazaki City in the Miyazaki prefecture, ergo it would be a... Miyazaki reference *badum-tish* -GHS
[Sakuraba]
『A full 12 hours of on-foot travel away, the most secluded backwood region is concealing Forbidden Supertechnology!』
//12 hours both ways? Unclear. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
『And at end of this long voyage, we can there finally see a truth so shocking that its impact could never even be imagined!』
//HACK vanish Sakuraba -GHS

Total nonsense.
In short, this idiot, while coming back home, drifted into a mountain that's not connected with the road.
//Map seems to fit, he just walked home on the south side and overshot the area of his mansion, ending towards the power plant. -GHS
He probably wanted to try a shortcut.
And then, he accidentally discovered a certain facility, and became all excited.
After this, the interview became even more absurd:
//HACK superimposed Sakuraba, serious face -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"In the hidden base..."
[Sakuraba]
"...shocking..."
[Sakuraba]
"...because of armed soldiers..."
[Sakuraba]
"...the defiance of the conventional wisdom of humanity!"
//HACK vanish Sakuraba -GHS

These are the top five words, by frequency, in the interview:
//Super Memory is possibly what lets him remember this absurdly irrelevant trivia... except why would he remember irrelevant trivia about one of the more annoying guys he knows? -GHS
                #1 "Mystery"      (x22)
                #2 "Impact"       (x19)
                #3 "Discovery"    (x17)
                #4 "Forbidden"     (x6)
                #5 "Hair-raising"  (x4)
//HACK reformatted + joined, since we have five lines now. I don't know what relationship all the sevens would have with the words themselves, if any. -GHS
The campus newspaper suckled on the bones of the delicious game named Sakuraba until there was nothing left.
Sakuraba understood with his flesh the cruelty of the press.
Afterwards, his bowels loosened via stress and he had diarrhea for a week (this became an article).
On the morning of the eighth day, he attended school with nonchalance on his face (inquiries on this were made by the paper)...
//7 days to recover, and on the 8 he returns... different. -GHS
...and his hair dyed the color of gold (they became material for a special report with man on the street pros-and-cons interviews).
//Connected to the above, the article is the same in both sentences. http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AD%91%E7%B4%AB%E5%93%B2%E4%B9%9F_NEWS23#.E7.95.B0.E8.AB.96.21.E5.8F.8D.E8.AB.96.21OBJECTION seems to be what is meant -GHS
Ever since then, the guy's lived the blond life.
He overcame the stress by imposing his self with the deluded belief that he'd become anew, definitely.
...however, that's also how we came to be known as the Gold-Silver Pair.
//Word typically used for Miki and Kiri. -GHS
But I digress.
Of course the structure built in great secrecy on the other side of the mountains by hyper intelligent beings visiting us from deep space that Sakuraba saw was in fact a nuclear power plant, which had brought about the abundant wealth of the locals.
//豊 = Yutaka's name. Will recur in unexpected places. Of course a significant part of the subtext. Curiously, there's also another structure built in apparent secrecy by ultraintelligent being(s) possibly visiting from off the world in this mountain... one way more important than the power plant. -GHS
In the strike of the blink of an eye, this three pennies for two acres of a land was transformed into rolls of banknotes.
//There's a two and there's a three... grrr, where's the other two? Maybe that miru-miru. -GHS
Modernization progressed, culture got civilized.
//This sounds just as ridiculous in the original. -GHS
With everybody reborn a millionaire, buildings were constructed, and people increased.
//I don't get it, shouldn't it be "tents were erected, and people were constructed"? -GHS
The land is cheap, the taxes just as cheap.
Electricity is free of charge.
Therefore, there are so many useless lighting fixtures throughout town.
//These may be what illuminate the forest where Kiri practices to day-level. -GHS
Nevertheless, they didn't 'rearn' to build the benches 'light', didn't they.
//grrrrroooooaaaaannnnn ライト = light + right, 仕込む = build into + teach/learn. I suppose it's harder to spot in Japanese. Perhaps a warning that even the Japanese better know enough English to spot this stuff if they want to understand some of the jokes and themes. Works backwards still: better know just a pinch of Japanese, or you'll be losing some of this stuff regardless. -GHS
The township decided that its theme would be 'healing'.
//See Gunjou. -GHS
For a remote place with a nuclear plant nearby, that's a very empty slogan to hoist up.
The city hall building itself was an extremely aesthetic building in Rococo style, that overflows from the exterior all the way to the interior with the stately fighting spirit of "How Thou Shall Be Healed!", so as to overwhelm anyone visiting there on official business.
//Highly sarcastic. Town hall seems to be in this side, but it's not on the map, never seen, and only one other time ever mentioned. Supposing it's in the south side, east of the Sakuraba mansion. -GHS
What an incongruous land.
Therefore... living here might just be very comfortable.
A world split and broken that inspires an odd affinity in me.

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Ow."

A frivolous sound emitted,
//Odd term. I suppose since this may actually not even happen at all... -GHS
my head sunk forwards with a thunk,
and the muscles of my nape stiffened with indescribable pain.

[Taichi]
"...the hell."

If I look over my shoulder, there stands, alone, a girl.
//Apparent ability to stand alone is what got Taichi into Touko, important. That "if"... -GHS

[Taichi]
"My, it is the Empress!"

[Girl]
"..."

[Taichi]
"The most pleasant wishes that this meeting finds You in good health, Your Majesty."
//Mocking high register. -GHS

A greeting with one raised hand.
//HEIL TOUKHITLER!!1 -GHS

[Girl]
"..."

To those words so rich in esprit, a retort wealthy in wit would be suitable.
//Accents don't work, likely Shift-JIS. -GHS
Like...
//HACK superimposed Touko -GHS

[Girl]
"Gwaaa〜h, whooo are you calling an Empreee〜ss! You shan't say something so stupid, shan't shan't!!!"
//HACK vanish Touko superimposed -GHS

But there's no reply of the type expected.
//From a Tsundere. -GHS
On the contrary, all I could feel was her cold-hearted wrath.

[Taichi]
"What's the problem, Kirihara? You're not getting into the spirit here."
[Taichi]
"Could it be that thing? That biological-ish thing?"

[Girl]
"......"

The mood grows steadily heaver,
but I don't stop.
//Minor emphasis on how he doesn't necessarily wish to go on. There'll be relatively few explicit hints of this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wreath of laurel."

[Girl]
"Kurosu Taichi...!"

The wave of rage swells up and outwards.

[Taichi]
"Auspicious red rice."

Touko... that's Kirihara's first name, and in my mind I vigorously strip it of honorifics... began to have a contraction in the dead center of her forehead.

[Girl]
"'llyyy!"

In truth, she's saying "reallyyy!",
so that had to have been her lisp.
It's her characteristic intonation.
It honestly made me laugh how Touko, so like a proper lady, still had immaturity in speech remaining inside her.
//General returning concept, she still has something of the infant in her for starters - see CCB2101 for more uhmmm infantile things she does with the mouth (sucking cock while sleeping). -GHS
And,
Smack!

[Taichi]
"...g'fuh?!"

It was on my chin.
//or on his dick. -GHS
It was a clean hit.
It was too fast to dodge.
Thrust upwards by the fist, the tip of my chin points to the heavens, the head thrown backwards.
//HACK Kirihara Fist reimplementation. Animation runs a little fast, but it works out well all things considered. These are all PS2 screengrabs, I have no idea where the 360 edition stores the graphics for this effect. It may even be a system-generated effect, not a graphical sequence. -GHS
fade-in is VERY slow -GHS
Yes, it sounds odd, but in both the PS2 and Xbox 360 versions, this SFX plays here and the rest is in silence. -GHS
Split because there's too many frames for AL to handle in one go. It causes a very slight pause in the animation, but it's almost impossible to notice without knowing about it. -GHS
   KIRIHARA   STYLE   HIDDEN   MOTION   DIRECT   STRIKE
//better centered but due to 5 lines it'll just never really happen. This is omitted in the console version, since the text is on screen, but the only alternative would be graphic editing that's waaay beyond my skills. -GHS
A videogame-like Imaginary special effect danced in my mind.
//HACK to properly fade in the screen from the new image, the old sky and Touko's new dolls must be loaded before the fade. Otherwise it looks like crap. And with this, one of the most complex hacks of the game ends. -GHS

[Touko]
"...now come help take down the tents."
//The death of Tentman. -GHS

It's a low voice.
If you fuss anymore from now, next time it won't be the sky that you implement a kiss with, but the ground.
That was the interwoven implication.

[Taichi]
"Yes ma'am, help I shall! (clatter, clatter)"
//Of teeth. These odd emoticon-like things seem less odd, perhaps, if reread straight from CCX0001. They'll be gone pretty quickly, however. -GHS

Without a word, my ear gets pulled as we head towards the camping ground.

[Taichi]
"Ow, ow, that huuurts!"

[Touko]
"The hand I hit you with also hurts!"

[Taichi]
"That's a good line only for a mother who hardens her heart as she goes to scold her child!"
//Hardening the hearts, very Biblical. -GHS

[Touko]
"We have so few men helping, so chop chop and get to work now!"
//Kiri Kiri. Her name'll also pop up. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But I worked, didn't I, throughout camp and lots..."

[Touko]
"Don't relax until the last moment, you!"

[Taichi]
"...not even allowed a short break."
//Significantly less funny considering how horrible it is for him to be here. No wonder he shatters into Another Story. -GHS

What am I, a soldier?
//See CCA0027. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kirihara."

[Touko]
"...what?"
//Oddly flat, considering. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're glad you came to training camp, right?"

[Touko]
"......"
[Touko]
"(Pfui.)"
//This may be the first instance of use of this term since the year 1952. Caren't. -GHS

I was ignored.
A clamorously wild failure to enliven the conversation.
And for all this, today's the day to speak out nonsense wantonly.
It's rather rare to have days of comedic duets like today.
//Very odd pair. I suppose this is a warning that he's going to hallucinate the rest to avoid going insane. This next dialogue, I believe, doesn't happen at all. -GHS

[Touko]
"Empty-head."
//So odd she'd try to play along despite it all, isn't it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Touko]
"When I punched you, it sounded hollow."
[Touko]
"If you don't let your neurons undergo division but quick, it'll be harsh when you reach adulthood, you know?"
//This is fairly evident as far as scientific trolls go: brain cells not undergoing mitosis is well known. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, how rude! Do we gotta go by lawyers now? Well?"
//This should remind of an arguing couple trying for divorce. Not the first time he'll bring up their old story in a manner this almost outrageously obnoxious, so it's intended to sound very different on second reading. This may be his answer to her 'pfui'. -GHS

[Touko]
"...you are... really... tiresome..."
//This might be real. -GHS

With a lengthy, exasperated sigh, this also withers.
I'm escorted in silence.
Against my better judgment, my sight runs down her of expensive-looking one-piece dress coiling down to her rear.
//Let's go with ambiguous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"White peach."

I mutter as not to be heard.

[Touko]
"Touch it and I sink you."
//Excellent hearing... -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

I-into what? (shudder, shudder)

[Touko]
"It was my precious Summer Vacation, and now it feels like I wasted a whole week of it!"
//This seems to make a liiittle more sense than the above. Touko would want to be away from Gunjou for Summer. So why wasn't she on the other side of the world or something...? Sakuraba I can understand, but Touko? -GHS

[Taichi]
"To paraphrase, 'this fun training camp is comeowing to an ennnd!', that's what it feels, right."
//"Little did they know that the nyans were only the beginning..." from The Chronicles of How an Innocent-Looking Translation Destroyed the World. Slightly more relevantly, this is Taichi intentionally misunderstanding. One of the few rare moments in which this is explicit. -GHS

[Touko]
"Didn't your brain split?"

It was split.
//It was split + it was made to split. This could mean it's broken; this could mean it's split as in a personality. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I managed to enjoy myself, though."

[Touko]
"Pah."

[Taichi]
"...and you had fun too dammit. (whisper)"

[Touko]
"DID. YOU. SAY. SOMETHING?"

[Taichi]
"No and nothing, SAH!"

One week of training camp.
//Later it will be an extended weekend. Unsure if it's intentional or just a (relatively minor) inconsistency. -GHS
And her smile I saw only a few times.
A disappointed face is in Touko's default settings.
//The computer terminology begins! -GHS
But she had fun, no mistake.
After all, with all the tents spread and the machine parts set up,
//機材 is the term used for the generic "machinery" that is brought up from the Club Room to the Antenna on the rooftop. The Training Camp looks more mysterious by the minute. They had survival games from the sound of it, but what anything else involved is never seen. If only because the idea they'd actually train with equipment and everything sounds so off for people who can't even look at each other. But they did stay there for a time, didn't they. -GHS
the training camp looked like an entirely different world.
//All with me now. Come on, don't be shy! We're only getting started: *cough* annnd SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"OwTchTchTchTch?!"

The Pulling Power on my ear got harsher.
//See CCX0001. This is the only other instance of this exact term. -GHS
Out of the forest path we come out to a wide grove.
The light is in the rise,
a resplendent sunshine.
//These seems to be the only clue that this is dawn, or at least no later than 6-7, since it uses the evening graphics. This fits them getting down by 10-11, and therefore the loop connecting 11:31 to 18:07, since by the time they're out of the path it's apparently inexplicably evening. The problem is that this is Sunday, therefore the world should get reset to a point before they enter. But let's not go break the setting; it's all in Taichi's head in the first place, so it's pointless. -GHS

[Touko]
"The striking... it's mostly done by now."
//How long has he been away? Maybe the whole of CCZAS took place right there. -GHS

[Girl]
"Come ooon, you two slackers over theeere!"

A voice resounded with boioioinnng.
//He might be talking about some part of Misato's anatomy, but my research has brought up nothing. -GHSarcasm
It's a peculiar tone of voice.
//Jokingly it's about boobs, less jokingly Misato is currently deeeeeep into her mask. That's why she sounds sorta happy and frisky when she's in fact distraught. -GHS
It's the President of our Club's.

[Touko]
"That is not what I am doing it is not!"
//Formal, talking to a Senpai because grammar nazism requires pseudo-connectional formal linguistics in the proto-bezoidal teching tech tech techy tech. -GHS

[Taichi]
"OwChChCh- don'tcha run it's dangerous! My ear especially... ah, ah, if you do it that hard you'll tear it off!, tear it tear it tear it off!!! My precious body part, you're gonna tear it ooooooooooooooff!!!"
//Suggestive? 裂ける (tear) also "tearing lovers apart" -GHS

[President]
"Wah, are you doing something sexually perverted?!"
//Then again, Misato may be forcing this joke, and poorly. -GHS
[President]
"Suspension, there will be a suspensiooo~n!"
//This was Misato's first nickname for Taichi. She seems to bring it out when flustered, see CCA0025C, also CCC4006. See also her brother's penchant for breaking out 'traitor'. -GHS

The President's voice quivered in embarrassment.

[Taichi]
"Wahahah!"

[Touko]
"Y-, you sphincter..."
//Curiously, all versions have a variation on this line. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Owww!"

At the very instant she finally released Our Beloved Ear, I stroked it together with my beaten-up head, and meanwhile,
//She smacked him earlier, see above, but given the sound she probably hit him on release as well. See CCZAS and CCX0001: is his "madness" something physical that can be beaten out of him? (Likely no or not quite, but the question is repeatedly asked). -GHS
I smile.
//AKA "force it" -GHS

[Taichi]
"HehShehSheh, it hurts."
[Taichi]
"Well, to work!, to work!♪"

[Touko]
"Really this man..."

Running lightly,

[Touko]
"Seriously..."

chased by Touko's sigh.
Behind the President's back, everybody was there,
In a duo in front of everyone.
//It's ambiguous whether this is Taichi and Misato or Touko and Taichi. In the first case, Youko is not here; in the latter, she is. Supposing intentionality. -GHS

[Taichi]
Heeeeeeeey!!!"
//ーx8 annnd there come the trolls. -GHS

I address the crowd without a real reason.
The faces of the five who were tidying up the equipment in the grove turned my way in unison.
When sights gather on me crazy I wanna be.
//Ugh, even rhymes? -GHS
I became topless by taking off my shirt.
//See CCC3004. He's repeating one of his most fun pattern. -GHS

[Touko]
"BUT NO?!"

Behind, the lady stiffened with a shout.
Uncaring, I ran around unclothed.
My nipples enter in collaboration with the wind.
I feel the sights of a group of five on me. More and more my excitement grows.

[Taichi]
"Look at me pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease!"
//See CCX0001, but CCB0023 might be more important. With the 'e' in 're', it's 32xE which is 4x8. There's with these a grand total of 8 8s in this script, so I can't change this. The 32nd E is the last one (sorry). -GHS

Five faces return to their original direction without a single change of expression.
Perfectly Coordinated Hyper Pro-Level Leave-It-To-Chance Sketch.
//Reading some sarcasm here... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ha-AH!"
//Should be unique, see CCC0006A, CCC4009, CCX0001 -GHS

Silly and nonsensical, but pleasing:
it's having fun, just for the moment.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
