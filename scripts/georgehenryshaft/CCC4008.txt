As I am waiting,

[Miki]
"Seeenpaaai!"

Miki had come, bringing Kiri with.

[Taichi]
"Yo."

[Miki]
"Been waiting?"

[Taichi]
"I was just about to show up, sir!"

Snappy jokes were a substitute greeting for us.

[Miki]
"Welll, persuasion has met unexpected difficulties, apologies."

[Kiri]
"...persuasion she calls it... persuasion she calls it...!"

Dissatisfaction was trickling incessantly from Kiri.

[Miki]
"Sexual desire incontrollable."

So she said in a whisper.
//HACK closed-eyes Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

She grew obedient.
What secret could Kiri possibly be hiding?

[Taichi]
"Well, where do we go?"

[Miki]
"Mountaaain!"
//"Right next to the cadaver of the person I believe is the only thing keeping you from snapping and murdering everyooone! MIKI ARE GENIOS" -GHS

[Taichi]
"...yama?"
//-nobe. Kawa? See CCC0009. -GHS

[Miki]
"Our date will be for us three to gaze at the townscape from the mountaintop!"

[Taichi]
"Sounds tiring. But nice."

[Miki]
"You like it too, Kiri-chin, right?"
//HACK toolazytowriteacomment Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...like it or whatever, I can't oppose this."

[Miki]
"Then GO!"

Miki takes my right arm.

[Miki]
"Come on, come on, let's link arms!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, 'k..."

And, on the opposite side, she links arms with Kiri.
//HACK closed-eyes Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...aye aye."
//HACK out dolls -GHS

An awkward walk in trio.
A walking pace that never matches,
confusion in the air,
and the enthusiasm has slipped off.
It's so like us, so very much.

[Taichi]
"Say, say, but shouldn't I be in the middle when walking like this?"
//HACK centered doll, fade -GHS

[Miki]
"We're fiiine like this!"
//HACK out doll -GHS

I meet Kiri's eyes.
Pfui!
She turns away.

[Taichi]
"...well, whatev'."
//"Like, not cool, gyarlz." -GHS

We walk in trio.
It was kind of hard to walk this way, but we gave it all.
//HACK fade doll (again) -GHS

[Miki]
"If we don't hurry the sun will sink and the day go dark!"

[Taichi]
"Shall we hurry?"

[Miki]
"Hur-ry! Hur-ry!"
//Sorta sing-y. -GHS
