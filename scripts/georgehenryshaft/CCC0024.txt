I am awake.
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
Sunlight was piercing through the window.
Seems I have been hard asleep. I did not have any dreams.
The time is... 7AM.
//Naturally, what else? -GHS
There's no need to go to school or anything.
Yet, the body moved.
Breakfast was not served.
Of course.
Career beauty Mutsumi-obasan and her cooking so delicious are no more.
//もうまい... -GHS
She had taken custody of me,
//Of course it can mean both... -GHS
and she had amicably taken care of that thing with Youko-chan...
//...and of course this means letting her out to a single apartment without a fuss. Or supervision. For an Ultramarine of Gunjou! Or maybe she just arranged another room and turned a blind eye to him occasionally cross-dressing. -GHS
I had an indefinite amount of appreciation to give.
But before I could show filial piety, she had disappeared.
//Of course, she's at the dormitory now. -GHS
On the table were laid two paper bags.
//See CCA0013. Yes, breakfast is not served. Except it is, and so is lunch. Conveniently, in the exact same manner proven to be Mutsumi's. Why would Youko imitate her? -GHS
Contents... sandwiches.
Youko-chan then.
A bag with enough for one person, a bag with enough for two.
Breakfast and bento.
The bento one is the one with enough for two.
I think that side of her is adorable.
She's still no damn good at putting the moves on people.
She's the type that can cover all the bases alone, that's why.
She's awkward even with me, her acquaintance of over ten years.
//Since Taichi's just after 17 (see CCB2005, 22 is 17 in eroge years), that means they've met when he was about seven years old and she was about eight. What are the odds? 100% of course. -GHS
But if she works hard, she will become so much more perfect.
//That sounds like it just ought to contradict. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...thank you for the food."

And still,
I joined my hands together towards that house in the East.
