Let's follow.
I have a bad feeling about this.
//...or so I wrote as a joke, but then I looked it up and that's seriously how the line was rendered in Japanese. Now, whether it's coincidental, that I don't know. -GHS
A very bad feeling.
//...though this is nearly the exact line Han Solo uses in A New Hope... -GHS
It's here, isn't it.
That... presence from before.
I know it.
I know... what that is.
Then, then... bicycle discovery.
//Also "father" and "anglefish", but, uhm not seeing it. More importantly, bad feeling -> Youko's presence? -> bicycle use. Notice he can use a bike, unlike a car. This is, of course, extremely thematically important. -GHS
There is no lock.
//...that he can't pick. -GHS
I borrow it.
//No stealing! -GHS
On to yesterday's place---
I come out of the thicket.
Kiri... isn't there.
Did she not come here then?
I try to search the area near where Kiri was standing yesterday.
I found the bag. She had come.
Did she go somewhere?

[Taichi]
"..."

Take a deep breath,
close the eyes, and impose strong pressure on the eyeballs with the eyelids.
In the depth of the crystalline lens of the eye, an image like a switch toggling its state surges out.
//Magic circuit... ENGAGE! F/SN was released a few months after this, but the F/SN trial was right eight months before Cross Channel. It's not impossible it's a straight reference. -GHS
The thing itself doesn't happen.
//Is he wearing night vision goggles? He totally is, is he. -GHS
I am just intentionally accelerating what the eyes would, slowly, normally do at the moment of a sudden change in brightness.
//...which is absolutely a normal thing to happen. And later on, he'll claim he can change at will between Normal and Night Vision, see CCD3003. This'll all be made bunk in CCX0001. -GHS
Open.
The night became bright.
The most insignificant motions of the vegetation are displayed clearly in my field of vision.
The fickleness of cat's eyes---
//Whoops, non-literal meaning ga aru... or should I say gairu. -GHS
Senses had become sharp.

[Taichi]
"This is bad... dammit."

There is also the sensation of having become someone else.
//And that's exactly all the hints you get, really. -GHS
So then,
into the depths of the grove.
//See CCC3003. Igi ari! -GHS
I felt a faint presence coming from there.

[Kiri]
"...hyah!"

I could hear a shriek.

[Taichi]
"!"

I run.
And the scene that filled my sight,
awakened horror and recollection simultaneously.
Dammit!
//Interesting he'd be reminded of that scene... considering back then she didn't do anything at all! This is another hint that what's happening here is nothing of what it looks like. -GHS
Youko-chan has seriousness in her eyes.

[Taichi]
"STOP!"

[Youko]
"...Taichi."

There was no semblance of surprise.
Perhaps she had noticed my approach.
//Or maybe there's a reason why in CCC3012B she doesn't come to kill Kiri, despite the only decision made here was Taichi not to come here. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!"

Seeing a chance, Kiri moves.
But Youko-chan had not averted her line of sight.
Twisting with the wrist, she makes the belt she was suspending rotate.
//Rocks are easily found, and Taichi wears a belt. -GHS
One revolution.
When one of the two ends now held in one hand is released, the stone laid between them is released, clad in centrifugal force,
//It's technically not real, but http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_force is close enough. Plus this is all an intentional ascientific troll anyway. -GHS

[Kiri]
"!!!"

and with a timing that made it impossible for me to do anything about it.
When their consciousness actively focuses even for an instant on the originating action, a person cannot react instantaneously.
//Reflexes are faster than rational thought I guess. -GHS
The stone strikes Kiri's calf hard.

[Kiri]
"Gh!"

Thump, and Kiri squats down.
Grasping her leg, grinding her teeth. She must be feeling intense pain.
The spine grew cold.
This is Stone Throwing.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
In olden times, shepherds used that technique
to guard sheep.
//Translation: "look at our wannabe King David here". Is she planning on jumping on Kiri, grabbing her crossbow, shooting her with it, and be anointed King of the Jews? -GHS
In contrast with the crossbow Kiri possesses,
it is an excessively primitive weapon.
No, it's not even a weapon.
It's not and yet... it is powerful, and
immensely so.
It's throwing a stone held with a belt at someone.
That and nothing more.
A propulsive power that use neither compressed
air nor gunpowder nor gas, but exclusively
length of string and speed of revolution.
//Compressed air, interesting he'd mention those. They have CA guns in the Club... -GHS
The bullet only takes air friction into account,
its gun barrel exists at the extremes of
detailed numbers.
//Assuming because it's the calculations required to account for friction and trajectory. According to a changed line in CCC3002 from the console version (not kept due to censorship metareferences), this should be what it means. It's an odd way of putting it, the term literally means "polar region". It's also there in the interview in the Materials Book: maybe it was in popular use in those years. -GHS
Its reliability permits continued utilization
for long periods of time under adverse
conditions.
Hers is a continued diligent research in how
to kill people.
In the end, of course, it can never reach
the level of a firearm.
//Which she knows how to use, see CCD3003. So why this big fancy spectacle? It seems it's all built for Taichi and the reader, and little more... -GHS
But there's that thing of hers that
was... different.
Under her figure that never transcends that of a
helpless girl lie internal muscles that surpass
even those of an adult man, descended from genes
blessed from birth.
//A 17 (18) year old girl with the speed and strength of an adult male. Totally plausible. Why, it's almost as believable as bullet-train-speed sneezes, brain cell mitosis, Kierkegaard writing Wittgenstein's Tractatus, ridiculously cute marmosets having 'fearsome' and "crafty" (are they brains???) muscles, the generation of Comic Force Fields, cat's eyes in humans, magically fogging-up glasses, the summoning of a sword from beyond time and space, martial arts masters providing random commentary, and boooy we haven't even started. Super Ninja! -GHS
It isn't just in physical strength:
it's in sharpness, in springiness and in mobility.
//All-surpassing Hyper Super, Mega Future... -GHS
On all of those terms her being a woman
cannot be taken as a handicap at all.
//This is just as scientifically ridiculous. As people who've actually went and sparred with women will tell you, if there's one thing they're inferior to men it isn't even strength: it's agility. "Girls are fast" is a pure videogame myth. -GHS
Hasekura Youko moves quickly and silently,
all the time.
The slingshot of stone throwing, so hard to
master, she manages as if it were an extension
of her limbs.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
No bolt is nocked in Kiri's crossbow.
...she must've returned fire and missed.
That is also supposedly a fearsome weapon,
but now, it isn't even good enough to be a shield for Kiri.
She is pressed on by the throwing stones, without the respite to load a bolt.
Well,
she managed to survive pretty well.
Though Youko-chan's first attack must have caught her unaware, she managed to preserve her life through it.
//More like, Youko couldn't kill Kiri despite being an invisible ghost. In other words, Youko's completely incompetent and/or likely is no more capable of killing someone than she was at the Mansion. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

She sets a second stone in the belt.
Utilizing the springiness in her wrist, she creates the afterimage of a disk. Instantly.

[Kiri]
"Wa... wait..."

Kiri's face turns pale.

[Kiri]
"Wh-, why... are you...?"

[Youko]
"Because you want to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"?!"
//HACK curiously the voice file for this was missing, but it's still there in the Sendback. Not always easy to tell what's intended to be removed, unfortunately. Let's keep it. -GHS

[Youko]
"Because you are practicing to kill Taichi."

[Kiri]
"...th-, that's why... you are going to kill me...?"
//It's sort of oddly phrased. Why would she be surprised that her behavior would cause Youko to do this? It's possible that it's just Kiri being a moron... but it's possible that what she heard "Youko" say is nothing of what we hear. The curse of Babel strikes hard here. -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

There is no response to her words anymore.
Ahhh, those are her "remove" eyes.
//HACK dim screen -GHS

[Youko]
『What are you afraid of, then? Want me to remove what you're afraid of?』
//HACK back to normal -GHS

All the things I dislike get 'removed'. By her. Always.
They simply and completely vanish from the world.
//Like all of humanity...? See the new CCD0022A: this line comes right before she fails to kill anyone at the Mansion. Or anyone here: she didn't remove Sakuraba when he annoyed Taichi, nor Misato when she did the same, nor Touko when she became too sticky. And while he might've forgotten, there's no way no how that Youko forgot about Yutaka! This makes little sense outside the Youko Is Taichi's Censor Filter, and even then... -GHS
I'm absolutely not talking about devotion,
this is favoritism, and very nearly self-conveniently so.
//利己 = convenient - self. 己 <-> 乙. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ahhh..."

The number of revolution grows.
The sharp sound of wind cutting the air.
As the destructive force swells out in front of her eyes, Kiri is bound down by fear.
//See CCB0006, same thing Kiri did to Taichi. -GHS
The certainty of death.
That is something that Kiri cannot believe.
The rotational force was imposing more than sufficient kinetic energy to the stone.
With her natural abilities, she could release it after one rotation.
//As she did above. -GHS
Her might has decreased somewhat.
Consequently, Kiri's leg did not take a serious wound.
//This reads as if Youko's strength has decreased in general, not that she's doing lots of spins because she can't kill Kiri with one spin. -GHS
But a precise hit on the head can, occasionally, bring about death.
Does she intend to take her out then?
//She's going to kill one bird with 2-3 stones! Uhm, badum-tish? -GHS
The number of revolutions is maintained sharp and high.
This time it will not end simply with pain.

[Kiri]
"S-, stooop..."

Setting her crossbow in front of her face, she sobbed.
//Kiri is not looking at what's happening. It's not certain she was even seeing anyone but Taichi. -GHS
Is this the limit for Kiri, then?
//HACK zoom even this? K... -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's far enough."

I stand in front of Kiri.
//Who has her crossbow in front of her eyes, and couldn't see, say... Taichi moving from what should be Youko's position to in front of her. And now Kiri can't see Youko at all, only Taichi's back. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"

The number of revolutions falls.

[Youko]
"If that is kept alive then Taichi will be harmed."
//Impersonal. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nah, I don't think so, not really."
[Taichi]
"There's the reset anyhow."

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Lemme do what I wanna do."

[Youko]
"...can't."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan!"

I call her name with strength,
but it doesn't seem she's backing down.

[Youko]
"Removing."

[Taichi]
"I'm fine without removing."

[Youko]
"Move."

[Taichi]
"Nooot going to move."

Behind me, Kiri is holding her breath and watching attentively.
A physical discomfort towards the combination between the relief of her life being saved and the idea of my intercession.
//違和<->違和感, which is the exact specific word that is used by Taichi to define Nanaka and Youko. Very odd she would feel that herself, isn't it? Now look closely at CCC3019A. -GHS

[Youko]
"But..."

Visible perplexity.

[Taichi]
"I don't want you to be a murderer using me as the reason."
[Taichi]
"If you wanna kill, come up with a reason of your own."

She falters.

[Youko]
"......but, for the sake of Taichi... I..."
//See CCD0022A as redone. -GHS

My sake.
Killing Kiri with my name on her lips.
And she'll do that without ever thinking if the result would hurt me.

[Taichi]
"...always, always like that. Always pushing onto others what are just your feelings."
[Taichi]
"Even when it's unwelcome---"

Youko-chan twisted her wrist.
//So she CAN do this with a single revolution? Or rather, none at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"!!!"

From the side, Kiri's head had poked out to peek into our conversation.
//And juuust as she's about to incontrovertibly see both of them... -GHS
I cover that face with the palm of my hand.
//HACK uhm, shake screen instead of doing nothing -GHS
The next instant, a stone was delivered together with intense pain.
//He could just smack his own hand with the slingshot. That's why she would just twist her wrist, not spin the slingshot. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Kyah?!"

[Taichi]
"...owww."

Youko-chan turns pale.

[Youko]
"Ah... sorry... forgive me..."

[Taichi]
"You betrayed me, didn't you."
//With that rock... is what readers are meant to think on first pass. -GHS

[Youko]
"...eh... uhm... but it's..."

[Taichi]
"You took advantage of me being distracted by conversation, didn't you."

That was unpleasant.
She's only ever serious about this kind of stuff.
//Since he's all but using her betrayal as leverage... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...again?"

Her shoulders shook with a start.
//She knows he remembers. More importantly, it's incontrovertible that this scene needs to be read in the light of Youko being unable to kill. Whether this is a show for Taichi or Youko simply being unable to work up the courage, this isn't a scene meant to be read straight. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're precious, you tell me. I love you, you tell me. You keep pushing your favoritism on me."
[Taichi]
"...and despite all that, in those very critical moments, you betray me."
[Taichi]
"Again?"

[Youko]
"Wrong, that was, I meant... to preserve Taichi's personal safety..."

Disoriented.

[Taichi]
"That's enough TALK!"

She cowers in fright, like a little girl being shouted at.
//This is foreshadowing of her Sendback, see CCD5001. Youko was never anything more than this. Never. -GHS

[Youko]
"...I-, I am sorry..."

A voice that seems to vanish.

[Taichi]
"Regardless, please don't kill Kiri."

[Youko]
"......"
[Youko]
"...but Taichi being killed is out of the question."
//Not just being murdered, also suicide. -GHS
[Youko]
"That, alone, I will never ever accept."

[Kiri]
"...I won't just let myself get killed easily ya know."

[Taichi]
"The skills gap between me and Kiri's just way too large."

[Youko]
"But... once in a while, Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Once in a while what?"

[Youko]
"There's this forgetting the reluctance to die."
//There's no way she can know this outside of being unreset... whether at the hokora or being a ghost like Nanaka. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, in these circumstances, yeah."

That's also that aspect of me, certainly.
I'm not proud of that, but my emotions are unstable.
//See CCA0003. Contradiction? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then I promise. As far as this week, I'll try not to die."
//Not more specific given that, well, he can just choose to die. But from this promise he can at least TRY not to die, whereas with the other one he can't BUT die. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I shall defend my body with all my strength. In exchange, you will withdraw and your hands will be tied."
//Figurative and literal seem to work both -GHS

[Youko]
"............"

[Taichi]
"If you can't give me your agreement, then this is where we part ways, OK?"

[Youko]
"Not that... that's... not that..."

Immediate response.

[Youko]
"Understood... withdrawing."
[Youko]
"But there will be monitoring."

[Taichi]
"As you wish."

[Youko]
"Hand me over Sakura Kiri's weapons."
//She seems to ask that of him... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Do it. Out with them."

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"The crossbow, and that knife or whatever it is you have."
//See CCC3010 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Take 'em out, if you don't you'll be stone cold killed."

[Kiri]
"......"

Wordlessly, Kiri tosses all in front of her.
Youko-chan picks them up.
//But Taichi's in front of her... and has a convenient big bag that'd totally fit a crossbow (or whatever the thing actually is) inside. -GHS

[Youko]
"Weapons are forbidden. Should you posses or retain any weapon, it shall be seen as hostile intent."

[Kiri]
"......"

Kiri does not move from behind me.

[Taichi]
"And by the way... you be a bit more amicable if you please, starting next week."
//...it's almost as if he knew she wouldn't forget... -GHS

[Youko]
"Ngggh..."

She seemed quite unwilling.

[Taichi]
"I'm asking you, please."

[Youko]
"...y-, yeah, got it."

...easy peasy.
And then her body sinks into the darkness.
Her presence is immediately erased.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

[Kiri]
"..."

The level of tension decreases by one,
but it's not zero yet.

[Taichi]
"............"

From behind, the source of tension continues to emit its aura.
And while aware that it was slowly being converted into anger,

[Taichi]
"...how's the injury?"

[Kiri]
"What reason."
//See CCD3003, to better contrast with a 'naze' -GHS

Angry and confused at having been saved by me.
Emotions growing complicated, that she's holding back a desperate desire to scream.
And with that mumbling voice,

[Kiri]
"For what reason... did you save me..."

[Taichi]
"The reason you ask... don't got one."
[Taichi]
"I wanted to save you, that's it, is that a problem?"

[Kiri]
"Please do not jest..."

[Taichi]
"...but I'm not jesting."
[Taichi]
"Well, that's how it goes. You're not gonna accept this anyway."
[Taichi]
"It's what being rescued by someone you don't like is about."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"You wanted to kill me, seriously?"

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Aw shucks, thank ye."

[Kiri]
"You are far too dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Dangerous?"

[Kiri]
"You mess around with people for your own enjoyment, that is why."
//HACK shouty Kiri -GHS
[Kiri]
"Even when things are like this, you did not change at ALL!"

All of a sudden, her voice raises.
Soon, her tone lowers.

[Kiri]
"...you would kill a man just for the fun of it."

Mood stagnates.
Hatred is being mixed in it,
the hatred that Kiri is spewing out.

[Taichi]
"Seriously, you see too well."
//See Misato. Remember that Kiri doesn't believe a word he's saying. -GHS

I let out a sigh.

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"You got a good eye for people, that's all."

[Kiri]
"What...?"

[Taichi]
"You think I'm the number one most dangerous, right?"

[Kiri]
"...indeed... but, you were not the only dangerous one."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan, right?"

[Kiri]
"...I wasn't doing anything but... she wanted to kill me..."
//Indeed, what is Kiri wasn't, in fact, doing anything at all here? -GHS
[Kiri]
"Y-, you two are of the same kind... therefore, you are as each other."
//Let's just keep piling on the suspicions, shall we. -GHS

We are not of the same kind,
but what I wanted to deny was something that Kiri could never even understand.
I stay silent.

[Kiri]
"Why did you save me?"
//This is CP'd in CCD3003 so it still fits 'why' -GHS

The question came again.
//HACK furrowbrowing-ly Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"You should have watched me die without helping."
//That's the absolute most she could conclude from what she saw with Yutaka. -GHS
[Kiri]
"I see you as an enemy... and I believe you know that, but..."
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS
[Kiri]
"There is nothing you can possibly obtain by rescuing me."

[Taichi]
"Now, now, in a manga for example this is how you'd expand your Nakama!"
//Manga term for manga mentions. -GHS

Anger swelled.
//HACK shouty Kiri instead -GHS

[Kiri]
"I will never become a true companion to you!"
//See CCD3003, explanation + contrast. -GHS

You lose if you become emotional.
Having yet seemingly self-imposed this rule, Kiri still fired off these harsh words.
//Wow, Kiri's a forum troll too? She already has the blue hair, now she only needs clothes at least a century off date and to be someone's obvious mary sue... -GHS

[Taichi]
"If I'm ever in a pinch..."
//HACK closed eyes Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"I will not run to you!"
//Typical manga writing ("not" excluded) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hm, nice twist on it."
//HACK more reloading the doll that's already on screen. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ngh..."

She bit her lips.

[Taichi]
"Well, I came up with the reason I helped you."
//HACK no need now -GHS

[Kiri]
"You came up with it you say..."

Uncaring, I said,

[Taichi]
"If you were to die, Kiri, Miki would be sad."
[Taichi]
"......"

Kiri's Achilles' heel.

[Taichi]
"And that said, should we leave it at that?"

[Kiri]
"Making people look stupid... always."

[Taichi]
"This is my eye-dentity indeed. Other ways to deal with things I haven't."
//It's all about the eyes. OK, it's probably more about love (ai), but that doesn't exist, much like women. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Ann'now, Kiri-chin."

First thing, this.

[Taichi]
"Shouldn't you give me some treatment for this injury now."

[Kiri]
"Why would I even do that!"

[Taichi]
"There's blood coming out right?"

I've been aware for a while now of the blood trickling down my fingertips.

[Taichi]
"I'm bad with blood."
[Taichi]
"Besides this injury was what allowed me to save you."

[Kiri]
"But that's just what you decided to do all on your own, Kurosu-senpai..."
//Watch that honorific, someone'll think that you actually like the guy. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I saved your life, therefore you'll be doing this for me as compensation."

Flat and clear.

[Kiri]
"...I understand."

Amenable.

[Kiri]
"Because I do not want to come into debt."
//Payback seems foundation. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

[Kiri]
"But... this medical help thing, really..."

She takes out her handkerchief and wipes the cut.

[Taichi]
"OwChCh, that kind of hurts!"

[Kiri]
"Ah... sorry..."

Kiri reflexively fired off an apology.

[Kiri]
"But... there's more."

[Taichi]
"Ugh, owChCh, it's all tingly tingly, I feel on the verge of death due to extreme blood loss!"
//HACK sweatdrop Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, uhm..."
//See CCA0027 again. Similar reaction. And speaking of back then: was Miki even capable of being honest on the extent of her injury...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Please heal me gently!"
//HACK unneeded now -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah... wha-...???"

Indecision.

[Taichi]
"If it was Miki-chan in this situation, you'll be healing her by going all licky-licky with your tongue wouldn't you!"

[Kiri]
"Lick...?!"

[Taichi]
"Wound gape painy... owChCh, this hurrrts!"
//Now he's just ridiculing her. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Th-... that's something... I don't want to do but..."

[Taichi]
"Please, hurry!"

[Kiri]
"I... understand."
[Kiri]
"Because I do not want to come into debt with you."
//HACK out with the doll -GHS

With the nervousness of diffidence, the tip of her tongue touches the gash.
//HACK this would slow fade in the doll for no reason whatsoever. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Nh... mnuh..."

Hot.
And furthermore, soggy.
It's as if I'm being bedaubed with lotion.
//Japanese fog's one mean bitch. Must be where Silent Hill came from. -GHS
There's a faint pain, but that's fine.

[Kiri]
"Hrhrh... nh... pch, hrh... aHuh... nh."
//Again, why isn't this counted as a sex sc--- oh, it was cut in the console versions, so it does. -GHS

She gently traces the gash of the wound.
From the palm of the hand crawls, gradually, a sweet numbness.
It enters the spinal cord from the shoulder, and travels down the spine until it is delivered to the coccyx.
The lower abdomen grows feverishly hot.

[Taichi]
"Very good, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Nhrh... nnh, nh, cHph, nfhuh... haaah."

On occasion, she distances her tongue and breathes a hot sigh.

[Taichi]
"The fingertips, too, make them clean."

[Kiri]
"Nh... nnnh... nfhuh, hrhruh... nh, nh, nh... hah, nfuhah."

With salivation noises her tongue crawls serpentine, descending on the palm of the hand.
The tongue then coils about the fingertips.
And that tongue I now pinch between two fingers.

[Kiri]
"nnh? N-, noo... ahnh... sto..."

Kiri spat out the fingers.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, had a creepy little itch about there."
//I was itchy + I made it creepy. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...did you... now..."

Blushing, then looking away.

[Taichi]
"Did you remove the blood?

[Kiri]
"...still... a bit."

[Taichi]
"Then if you please!"

Kiri timidly, nervously makes her lips crawl on the offered fingertips.

[Kiri]
"Pch, pch... nnh, fWhah, nh... aHfh..."

The treatment seems tense, perhaps because she's containing her nasal breathing.
//...he's totally using 鼻息 as in "sexual excitement", is he... -GHS
I am standing.
Kiri is sucking my fingers, kneeling.
That very Kiri.
My water level rises.
Wicked black water is being accumulated.
//That, or it's growing a beard. I know, I know, but I can actually argue why that makes sense: Japan. See CCC3009. Though he's really only referring to his dick. Once you realize this is intended to be funny, it's actually kind of sweet. -GHS
That... it ought not be.
//Curiously, there's still a few added lines of Kiri being made to choke on Taichi's "fingers" in the console version. Not worth bringing over, they don't fit at all with the next of Kiri's line and are almost entirely redundant. -GHS
Before long Kiri distances her tongue.

[Kiri]
"...it is done."

[Taichi]
"Thank ye."

The blood had been stopped as well.

[Taichi]
"...what Youko-chan said, I think she's serious."

[Kiri]
"?"

Kiri's eyebrows knitted as she wiped the corners of her mouth.

[Taichi]
"You're weaponless now. And staying weaponless would be best."
[Taichi]
"If you violate that agreement, I think she might seriously assault you."
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

Her shoulders tremble, slightly.
In terror.

[Taichi]
"Me, I don't really think want to do much to anyone."
[Taichi]
"As you said, Kiri, although I might be a ne'er-do-well... I have no intention of hurting my Nakama... my friends."

[Kiri]
"You... are serious?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."
[Taichi]
"On the contrary, I'm assembling the antenna in place of Mimi-senpai, who got hurt."

[Kiri]
"Antenna... the club's..."

[Taichi]
"That's for sending out an SOS. You know that, 'course."

[Kiri]
"...but people... there's none anymore."
[Kiri]
"Television doesn't work. Nor radio. Nor the 'net. Nor telephones."
//Nothing excessively weird in the terms... -GHS
[Kiri]
"Nothing but nothing seems to be conveyed... are you saying someone is still alive?"
//...but she could still mean "I can't find anything good about the people around me", i.e. that everybody is metaphorically gone, not literally so. Regardless, it's only these two lines, as the first can well be metaphorical. -GHS

It's not just that.
This is a world that has abandoned even moving ahead.
An eternity of one week.
To me, that comes with nothing but a distinctively sweet sound.

[Taichi]
"...that training camp... wasn't that pointless."
//Odd change of topic. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Forcing the setting against will, gathering seven people with so much hardship, with soothing and coaxing, with blatant lies..."
[Taichi]
"Not even the time to blink the eyes and out came the faults in that attempt."

Still I smile.
Kiri threw a look at me that said she was yet discerning something heterogeneous.

[Taichi]
"We took down the tents in the worst of moods, didn't we."

[Kiri]
"...were you not the one to arrange it?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed, I arranged that."

[Kiri]
"In order to widen the size of everyone's wounds."
//Come on, girl, that's just mad. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're mistaken."
[Taichi]
"I wanted everyone to get along again."
[Taichi]
"I wanted our relationships to return like they were in the good old days!"
//IOW, formatting... see CCD2002, but it's a theme throughout the story. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...that is a lie."

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."
//HACK no doll change here -GHS

[Kiri]
"Are you saying that you intended to create a chance for reconciliation by assembling the people at the training camp?"

[Taichi]
"I am."

Pupils twinkle.
The water surface shakes as if shivering.
//HACK and no need to change back -GHS

[Kiri]
"That... I don't want to believe."

[Taichi]
"Well, that's fine."
[Taichi]
"The point is, creating unity is what's important."
[Taichi]
"Doesn't matter how. Be it club activities, be it the training camp."
[Taichi]
"Putting the antenna together with everybody, using limited parts, then sending an SOS..."
[Taichi]
"Isn't that an aspiration worth having?"

[Kiri]
"...you are... not that upstanding a person."

[Taichi]
"Yep, not upstanding at all."
[Taichi]
"However, that is that, this is this."

By inserting demonstrative pronouns four times in a sentence I construct an idiom that is extremely unshapely and clumsy when contrasted with the aesthetic sense that is the goal of modern Japanese expression, and with it I change subject.
//Something is very wrong here. What has Japanese got to do with anything when this is in English??? HELP! -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm not upstanding, but I can still think about what a beautiful thing it is to get along well, can't I."
//The problem is that he doesn't like good relationships to change... or relationships to change at all. -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Tsk, I totally forgot, but, how're your injuries?"

[Kiri]
"Ah, I am alright... do not touch me!"

[Taichi]
"If I donn'touch I can't know, duh."

The calf...
It's become swollen.

[Taichi]
"...internal bleeding, isn't it. She got you in a nice precise spot."
[Taichi]
"It'll hurt to walk, but it isn't serious."
//Internal bleeding doesn't sound unserious... I'm no doctor either, but she wouldn't be walking anywhere for a few weeks if that were the case. Then again, he's clueless, so it's probably just overstating a bruise. A stone thrown at that speed from that close should not do this little damage, once more. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The other?"

[Kiri]
"Shoulder..."

[Taichi]
"Strip."

[Kiri]
"?!"
//HACK wrong doll again. -GHS
[Kiri]
"I-, I knew it, you animal..."

Covering her shoulders, she steps back.

[Taichi]
"Come now come now, that was a joke. Don't take it so seriously."
//HACK This Kiri. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Isn't that... just what you say before doing sexual harassment to Miki and to others anyway?"

[Taichi]
"Miki, you say now? But when she seriously doesn't want something done to her she refuses straight and clear, you know?"
[Taichi]
"She goes all, you can't do THAAAT!, cackling mad while she wallops me hard, didn't you see?"

[Kiri]
"...Miki does that?"

[Taichi]
"And when she does, I don't push the matter, either."
//Yeah, but the point would be to stop BEFORE you got to that. Otherwise, if he met someone like Kiri, who goes straight from tolerating to killing people with a crossbow... well. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I'm adapting the boundary lines as I perform all kinds of contacts. Isn't that what with socializing is? Am I wrong?"

[Kiri]
"...you summarize it as if it was so clean... but it's sexual harassment..."
//See CCA0007 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, you just take things just way, way too seriously."
//In short. But so does Miki. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I'll be touching your shoulder now."

[Kiri]
"Eh... kyah!"

There was pain even when I went over it lightly.
//揉 -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I touched the bad spot have I."
[Taichi]
"How much pain?"

[Kiri]
"...I can just about... still move the arm..."

[Taichi]
"Please raise it above the head."

Obeyed.

[Taichi]
"So there's nothing wrong with the bone."
//Again, far from expert, but I suspect the problems would be far more apparent if it were. One thing remains certain: she couldn't do significant damage to Kiri with stone throwing. Kiri's repeatedly compared to glass. Youko couldn't shatter her... at all. Either she's holding back way further than she story says she should, or Youko's skills are absolute garbage. Either can be very telling. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...you just put too much strength into it, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"I didn't put any of the sort."

[Kiri]
"...men are all so strong aren't they... Shima-senpai, for example, he's so slender yet he can lift one of those monitors on his own."
//Says the girl who can fire a crossbow WITH ONE HAND. And once again, Super Ninja with her supra-male muscles can't take this thing? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...that guy's ex-basketball club, that's why... he can't run, that's it, his physical strength remains."

Ahhh, but this girl can't even lift one of those CRT monitors on her own power then.
//First time the term 'monitor' is specified as a CRT. Still assuming the stuff brought to the rooftop are transceivers, and they're referring to the CRT of the Broadcast Ready Room PC(s), not ones that will be used to ineptly ruin a major reading key the author rewrote a major episode to exposit. -GHS
She's really lacking in strength.
Certainly the ones in the Club Room are pretty big.
//Still nothing in the Club Room BG except the TV that would fit the bill... -GHS
When I touched her shoulder I was surprised by how awfully delicate it was.
It feels like it would shatter immediately, like a brittle thin plate.
If the Broadcast Club had an arm wrestling competition, wouldn't she fall dead last rank?
//...despite surviving two direct stone strikes by an allegedly trained killer without an issue, having a nearly superhumanly powerful kick, and later in Miki's route she'll keep toe-to-toe with Taichi repeatedly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...sigh."

She's a helpless girl.
//Hum, who was just described with this term, at least externally? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Put a compress on that now."

[Kiri]
"...you do not need... to tell me that."

Her abusive language has no strength.

[Taichi]
"Good, so, shall we go home?"

I start going.
//Lit. "I stand up", but in the water level thing above, Taichi was standing, Kiri was kneeling, and he is not even hinted to have kneeled when he checked her wound. Going with a lateral meaning, but I suspect error. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come now, let's go!"

Unwillingly and grudgingly she comes with.
//HACK eyes closed Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"OW-!"

[Taichi]
"I knew it, it hurts, right? Wanna piggyback?"

Ten fingers wriggle and squirm while making a grabbing gesture.
//HACK so this is her frightened...? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...stop, stay back!"

She's seriously frightened.

[Taichi]
"But it's just a joke..."

[Kiri]
"Then I will go home... on my own."

[Taichi]
"I think Youko-chan'll attack if you're on your own, don't you?"

[Kiri]
"............"

She became silent.

[Taichi]
"So, let's go."
//HACK out with the doll -GHS

Behind my back, the sound of light footsteps trudging along.
I leave the bicycle and we walk the way back.
//Poor whoever he stole the bike from. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...nice night, innit."

There was no conversation.
