On leaving house to go to school, there's Hasekura Youko.
//Monday September 7, 1998 -GHS
//No jokes, no pauses, just... *shudder* -GHS

[Taichi]
"Morning, Taichi."
[Taichi]
"Yep. Well, with that said bai baaai!"
//No wonder he wasn't all that heartbroken last week after all. -GHS

Leaving.
The lower part of my trousers is pinched from behind.
//she a dog now...? Was she always a dog? What an odd way to put it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'weh..."

[Youko]
"Bu-, but we could talk for just a while..."

Her voice was shaking.

[Taichi]
"You act all subordinate to me, but still sometimes you try to plot against me."
[Taichi]
"And because you're like that I can't go all-out with my trust."
//This is very interesting to contrast with CCC0000, and the bad end of the route. -GHS

[Youko]
"Staging an adequate stimulus."
//Even odder. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're just going to make me dance around as you please in the palm of your hand, you little girlie with your squidlike profile."
//http://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AB%E8%85%B9 this is hard to describe succinctly and doesn't seem to have an English equivalent. And I still don't see how it applies to her. -GHS

[Youko]
"...so Shima Tomoki-like. Just a bit of disillusionment."
//Meaning he treats her like Tomoki treats his sister...? -GHS

I had been disillusioned.
//As usual, causative as well as past. -GHS

[Youko]
"That's fine. Not really a problem. You're a bit monkeyish, Taichi."
//May have worked better given the 'monkey' in his definition of Yutaka, but that one simply doesn't work. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't make a fool of me, please! I am a primate."
//I think the joke is that he doesn't know that monkeys are primates... -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

I felt like I had just been ridiculed.
Damn, so defiant.
I'll bully her.
I flipped her skirt.
//Console version has her wear a skirt made of metal. Yes. WTF. And yet there was that thing about metal underwear in Miki's route; maybe it's not WTF at all. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Aren't those some pretty sexy short panties that you appear to be clad with?"

[Youko]
"Women always play to win."

Unagitated.

[Taichi]
"Shall I take down your panties wholesale?"
//Lower & sell wholesale, see CCC0003A. Well, they can remember it for you wholesale, so I guess he can do that wholesale as well. -GHS

[Youko]
"...anytime."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Go on."

Nghhh.
Booo-ring.
There's no fetishism in this female.
//Which should be absurd, given her backstory. -GHS
There's no shyness.
This isn't working.
I could never hand my cerise soul to her, never.
//French for Cherry. Wanted to use the Japanese word, but it apparently doesn't exist! -GHS
Whatever might have happened physically, that is.

[Taichi]
"Well, here's something."

I take out a certain 'that' from the Taichi bag.
//It's a vibrator. -GHStandardAnswerToEverything
I then pinched her nose,
and waited for the moment when oxygen deprivation made her open her mouth.

[Youko]
"..."

Five seconds.
Ten seconds.
Thirty seconds.
One minute.
One minute and a half.
//Nothing in the numbers that I can see. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...uhm, any breathing?"
//World record of apnea for women is 8:23 as of 2009. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

Why is she alright like this?
I stopped.
Releasing my hand, she steadied to a light breathing.

[Youko]
"High amount of oxygen in the blood, I can stop for a long time."

[Taichi]
"You an ocean floor diver or something, you gotta be."
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B5%B7%E4%BA%BA It's read "Ama-san", which is also BICCHI DA ZO, but more interesting is that this seems to be an explicitly male term (dot dot dot). -GHS

[Youko]
"What did you want to do?"

[Taichi]
"...I was thinking how nice it would be if I made you open your mouth."

[Youko]
"Ahhhh."

That was simple.

[Taichi]
"Out with the licker."

[Youko]
"Nhhh."

A long tongue.
I sprinkle tabasco. Around ten drops.
//Technically 'tabasco' can refer to the the pepper, although a better question would be what the hell he's doing with tabasco sauce in his bag o'crap. Damn adventure game protagonists carry around the oddest stuff. Also, 7-8 are around 10. -GHS
I spread it well with the fingers.
Tongue is sooof',
and also with a surface that's just somewhat rough to the touch.
//She's totally a cat. -GHS
She has all the qualities to become the best of all hostesses in a Pink Salon.
//It googles. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Here, I have finished."

[Youko]
"..."

I thought for an instant she would be alright, but...

[Youko]
"...!!!"

She held down her mouth and shook.
She goes to lean onto the brick wall.
That was effective.
Because she has a tongue far more excellent than that of a normal person's, she's sensitive.
//He's got eyes and ears, and she got the tongue. Of course, because when it comes to spicy stuff, she can't stand it. And then curry... heh heh. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wanna drink some juice?"

[Youko]
"...yes, yes... hurry..."

She nearly rips it off my hands and drinks.

[Taichi]
"It's Chili juice, like it?"
//He also got chili. -GHS

[Youko]
"Ngh..."

She collapsed towards the fence.

[Taichi]
"Beat you..."

It felt like a long time since the last clean victory like this.
Well then, let's go to school.

[Youko]
"...at... least... the... lunch..."

She clings to me,
and with teary eyes she hands over a paper bag.
That stimulated some sort-of feelings of guilt.

[Taichi]
"...got it, I'll take that."

Motherlike.
//Also "mother abuse". -GHS
But a mother I don't have.
//Hence why Nanaka's made of gelatinous substance. -GHS

[Youko]
"Have a safe walk."

That was welcome, but honestly, I wasn't that happy.
