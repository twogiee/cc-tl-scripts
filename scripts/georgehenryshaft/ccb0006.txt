even when it's this hot.
Those guys are always serious.

[Taichi]
"Well then."

What do I do now.
With the rooftop under the blazing sun, that's not really a place to cool off in.
I tried peeking inside a class nearby, sure enough, a lesson was in progress.
First Year Class E, the class that was being taught by Machiko-sensei.
//PCP CCA0007 2 merged lines & tense -GHS

"..."

With her, there wasn't even the link of an exchange of superficial feelings.
It was probably too excessively ordinary.
Now we're just strangers.
Anyway, if I keep loitering in the corridors like this someone'll find me.
I buy a meal ticket in the deserted cafeteria.
To the club room.
Tomoki kept reading that manga magazine.
A light conversation bounces off.
//Exchange + deflect, see CCA0007 -GHS
Midway, the passage of Mammoth became great uproar.
And after 'that' had moved on,

[Tomoki]
"Close so close!"

[Miyuki]
"We should just put up curtains on that corridor window."

[Tomoki]
"That was forbidden. School got wise to that already."

[Taichi]
"There's something we could do."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, I know what you ladies think of me. But this isn't some annoying gag, I really think there's something we could do."
//HACK Tomoki & Miyuki Sepia 5 -GHS

[Miyuki]
"What would that be?"

[Taichi]
"Tomoki, get me the machine back in working order. Also, the digital camera."
//HACK back to Tomoki & Miyuki Sepia 2 -GHS

"How's this feel then!"

[Tomoki]
"Camouflage then, huh."

A full-color print titled Unoccupied Interior was affixed to the windowpane on the inside.
The viewpoint is somewhat shifted, but there was potential it could fool a casual glance fired off at it.

[Tomoki]
"Yah, with this we maybe won't be caught."

[Taichi]
"Wahaha!

Proud I am.
//HACK Back to Tomoki & Miyuki Sepia 1 - yes, both dolls change. I suspect a bug, but without being able to use the 360 dolls... -GHS
And that's around when Miyuki came back from the toilet.

[Taichi]
"How was the toilet?"
//HACK Tomoki & Miyuki Sepia 6 -GHS

[Miyuki]
"Nhaaawww!"

She cried.

[Miyuki]
"But I didn't even say one word about going to the toileeet!"

[Taichi]
"If you come back going all wipey-wipey on your hands with a towel, anyone could tell where you've been!"
//In the console version, where all the doll changes are much slower, there's the delay of a doll change here with no actual corresponding change of dolls. I suppose the change to Tomoki's doll that happened when Miyuki came in was a bug, and this is when the current image had to be displayed. I have no practical way of fixing this bug without access to the data files, sorry. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Really, I told you..."
//HACK Tomoki & Miyuki Sepia 7 -GHS

An appalling sensation pervaded me.

"W-, why you slovenly-!"

"Chastisement this demands, chastisement! Chastisement! Chastisement!"

While continuing the uproar, I walk in a circle around Miyuki,

"You enemy of women!!!"

Could that be a drop-kick from behind perhaps indeed that is so.
Slowly my awareness was clouded up as if by fog... and just before completely going, it was back.
//Guessing this is a pun on her name. -GHS
Bam.
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS
If I had fainted, I wouldn't have felt the agony of smacking my face into the floor.

[Taichi]
"...ugh... that hurt you know, underclassman!"

The feeling of a sight using me as a guiro, pinning me down.
//That's a musical instrument. -GHS

[Kiri]
"But who is in the wrong here should be readily apparent."

[Tomoki]
"For crying out loud don't just talk to me as if we were friends, please!"
//See end of route. -GHS

Tomoki took a cold Not My Problem stance.

[Taichi]
"Tsk, damn hypocrite!"

Ah, who cares.

[Taichi]
"You! Underclassman! Before I consign you to oblivion, I will hear what you claim to be your name!"

"Molester!"

[Taichi]
"Are you trying to replace me?!"

[Tomoki]
"An idiot to the end of time ain't you."

"I will be telling the teachers."

"Huh, teachers. Which teacher are you planning on going to cry to, my dear lady?

[Kiri]
"Any is fine."
[Kiri]
"Because what's this but sexual harassment!"

[Tomoki]
"...I haven't known Kurosu that long but,"
[Tomoki]
"I'm so glad the number of times I've heard the words 'sexual harassment' has grown by leaps and bounds. Thank you so much."

[Taichi]
"Worry not about it, my friend, 'tis a technique born of natural virtues!"

[Kiri]
"Flipping skirts all bold and unapologetic... disgusting!"

[Taichi]
"Ehhh, aren't I awesome."
//Think he's talking about himself. -GHS
[Taichi]
"So you gonna rat about that to the teachers?"

[Kiri]
"Yeah!"

[Taichi]
"Say, I wonder, has the Heroine of Justice-chan considered this?"
[Taichi]
"Why would I, unashamedly and in broad daylight, and in company furthermore, be trying to so attentively flip a skirt?"

"Furthermore, why would Public Morals Committee Chairman Shima Tomoki here be also incapable of putting a stop to this?"

[Tomoki]
"What?!"

[Kiri]
"It-, it couldn't..."

[Taichi]
"It could, exactly!"
[Taichi]
"For I, to make the implicit meaning into an explicit, am endowed with a tremendous amount of political influence over this institute!!!"

On the trail of the last words shock zoom and sharp sound effect as I opened my eyes.
//Not graphic enough in English otherwise. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You said that already."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"And the spot where you used that line was sort of way too early, wasn't it. The one before I mean."

[Taichi]
"......"

"And they told me that there's no bullying at the Gunjou Institute..."

"Uhm, I wasn't really being bullied..."

"Those two are always like this. It's not ill will!"

"'Those two'..."

I sulked, dejected.

And then,

[Tomoki]
"Ngggh..."

[Taichi]
"Ghhh..."

The two of us lie on our back in the hallway.

[Miyuki]
"...do you need to go to the infirmary?"

[Taichi]
"Wh-, what about that Champion of Justice of earlier?"

[Kiri]
"Sakura Kiri. I'm not a Champion of Justice."
//Typically translated as "Ally of Justice", but I never liked that. This trope would seem to apply to Kiri in more than a sense. I'm always amused by how this term is used to mean "someone allied with Good", but because actually going into what Good really means is hard, it was instead invalidly replaced with an undefined Justice. ...but I guess that's too far off the topic. -GHS

So she said while looking down on us.
//Both meanings of course. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...furthermore, you have understood that evil has no sense of beauty."
//I think she's referring to the sad spectacle they just gave, not generally. -GHS

With a sudden Tomoki explodes in a torrent of tears.

[Tomoki]
"I-, I have nothing to do with this! It's Taichi's fault, always making me..."

Tomoki huddles over until he looks as round as the larva of a stag beetle.

[Tomoki]
"Had enough. Hikikomori now."
//Will recur. ...of course. -GHS

Sobbing and weeping tears flow out.

[Miyuki]
"Pushed that far..."

[Kiri]
"If the girl also says it's fine, then in deference to this unpresentable event, I will overlook things this time."

[Taichi]
"...once I'm able to move myself again...! I will not let this slide... Kiri or what was your name!"

Kiri laughed with scorn.

[Kiri]
"Please, feel free to."
