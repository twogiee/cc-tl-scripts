[Taichi]
"Hellooo!"

[Miki]
"...l-, layyy〜te"
//"Late" in Koushuu-ben. -GHS

We returned to the rooftop.

[Miki]
"Ah, you brought Kiri-chin with you!"

[Taichi]
"We came oh yes."
//Miki-tachi (LOLOLOL ME JAPANEYSE-DESU) totally ought to have heard, given Kiri was apparently shouting out the damn window in what is allegedly a perfectly isolated facility. -GHS

[Misato]
"Somehow... you're looking all glossy and slick..."

[Taichi]
"We are slick and we are glossy, yes."

[Miki]
"...what is it, Kiri-chin?"

[Kiri]
"Eh, naah, nothing really..."

[Miki]
"Your things are over aren't they?"

[Kiri]
"O-, over, but..."

Fidget-fidget she rubs her legs together.

[Misato]
"...the color of your face is less than full, are you alright?"

[Kiri]
"I am alright. Just a bit tired... Summer fatigue."

[Taichi]
"That's way bad. You'll just have to liquidate your Summer fatigue by drinking my Special Brew White Juice!"

I take out the canteen.

[Misato]
"Thank you very much, Peke-kun."

She accepts the canteen.
This Special Brew White Juice is, on first sight, a normal brew of lactic acids; however, a splendid ingredient is sprinkled in to bring out its flavor.
//Not quite the "wonderful" in "wonderful lives" (semen) -GHS

[Miki]
"White juice?"

[Misato]
"Ah-, what is that thing?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

I look at the sky.
Could it be a UFO? Where's Adamski?
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Adamski -GHS

[Misato]
"......glug-glug-glug-glug!"

[Taichi]
"But there is nothing there?"

[Misato]
"Whew, thank you very much for this!"

She returns an empty canteen.

[Taichi]
"...aw, you drank it all."

[Misato]
"Yes, we divided it among us all three."

[Miki]
"...eh? When?"

[Taichi]
"Hahahahah."

[Misato]
"Heheheheh."
//4+4 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhhahahahahah."

[Misato]
"Hehehehehe."
//7 (total) + 7 -GHS

It's all good, it's all good.

[Miki]
"Uhm... it looked like you just tossed it away to mYAN---"

Mimi-senpai embraced Miki.

[Miki]
"MGuHGuHGuHGuH!"

Big Beautiful Breasts Clampdown.
//See CCA0022 (same term) -GHS

[Taichi]
"...tossed?"

[Misato]
"Say, look here please! Most of the preparations are in order!"

I was taken and brought with.

[Taichi]
"H-, huh?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, say."

[Kiri]
"Yes, what?"

[Miki]
"...it's nothing."
//Maybe she knows, maybe she doesn't. -GHS

[Kiri]
"?"

A conversation at my back.
I was a bit concerned, but my awareness was all at once directed towards the tent.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Saaack!"

[Sakuraba]
"-Raba. In other words, the rest of me is a lover."
//Ha, you thought it was going to be a problem. Curiously, 'roba' is donkey, while 'ruba' is mule. I know what you're thinking, but obviously 'reba' is gangrape and 'riba' is about ancient land controversies. -GHSomeOfTheseMayNotBeAccurate

Sakuraba was under the tent.
//See CCC3018: that makes him a dick. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And Tomoki?"

[Sakuraba]
"Siscon grew troubled and went home."

[Taichi]
"...right."

[Sakuraba]
"He just got the wiring in order. Guy's a working man."

[Taichi]
"Mh-hm."

Well, if we got this far we shouldn't need to worry.

[Misato]
"Let's take a break then. My throat is parched."

Senpai produces cans of tea from a small refrigerator.

[Taichi]
"...eh? Did you say you're thirsty?"

[Misato]
"Look, with extra batteries we have resurrected the conveniences of civilization!"

It was a refrigerator even smaller than the one in the club room.

[Taichi]
"Ehhh."

From Tomoki, innit.

[Misato]
"It has been so long since the last cold drink!"
//She probably keeps the alcohol in the shed. That's not gonna be good... -GHS
[Misato]
"Here, this is for you."

[Taichi]
"This is fine, however... Senpai, my White Juice, before..."

[Misato]
"Bottoms uuup!"
//Works better, given who she is (a drunkard) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, uh, bottoms up... of course."

Maybe that White Juice just wasn't enough.
And it was a Special Brew of a lactic acid drink mixed with lemon juice...
Ah, whatever.
//That'll teach you to be ambiguous. This was a nice reading key for a Cross Conversation. -GHS
We breathe a sigh of relief with tea and shade under the tent.

[Taichi]
"Wheeew, this is a return to life, innit Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"Right after losing all those fluids."

[Kiri]
"Cough, kaff!"
[Kiri]
"SENPAI!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ahahah!"

[Miki]
"Senpai, you two've wee-weed too?"

[Taichi]
"'Twas the two of us standing and peeing, outdoors. Further flyer's winner."

[Kiri]
"We did not! I can not!"

[Miki]
"Yo-, you kept something that seems so fun secret from me..."
//Since she might not know, she might be sincere. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Miki... that doesn't seem fun at all for starters..."
//Kiri, of course, wouldn't know that Miki knows, whether Miki knows or not. -GHS

[Miki]
"Doooes it nooow?"

In recent years she has been losing it with a speed comparable to that of deforestation, but I still expected Miki would be fundamentally green.
...wait.
//Best guess, see CCC4004. Taichi's noticing something is wrong with Miki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"By the way, if you act all that flustered they'll notice, Kiri-chin."
//She's still not wearing any panties. -GHS

[Kiri]
"............"

Pinning down the edge of her skirt, she became docile.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah!"

[Sakuraba]
"By the way, Taichi, broadcast's tomorrow, so... I tried to write the script that President-senpai asked for."
//See CCX0001... as if that wasn't a meta reference. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hoh, the bastard that you are managing something like that?"

[Sakuraba]
"Please have a look. I wish to hear your opinion."

[Taichi]
"..."

I couldn't read it.

[Taichi]
"...what language is this?"
//Very good question. I still have no idea. Seems to be an unholy mix between Japanese, English, and Plain Weird. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"In the thousand-to-one chance we are being monitored, they will not understand the meaning for it is encrypted with multiple ciphers."
//18 months of work and I fear I still didn't break more than 95%. Monitored by who, however? The devil? Tanaka's superiors? Unqualified readers? All of the above? All of the above. -GHS

Punched.

[Taichi]
"Meaningleeess!"

[Misato]
"...aaah, the time that I gave Sakuraba-kun was wholly and completely wasted..."
//Why the hell did she even ask Sakuraba??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"The hell we'd be doing by sending an SOS without a message you can understand!"
//That'd be my criticism of Cross Channel in a nutshell. -GHS

And that moment,

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

wind bells chimed.
//Going by Week 1, this has nothing to do with the wind... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ain't that a wind chime?"

[Sakuraba]
"...I put it there."
[Sakuraba]
"I thought that we would all be mate-ing together here, I think."
//http://www.ecowindchimes.com/History-of-Wind-Chimes-s/59.htm "The principle behind a wind chime - one element meeting and affecting the other in one accord, and the resulting harmonious “song” carried by the force of the wind - was compatible with this philosophy." May be just that simple. Since these people coming together is no coincidence (see Sakuraba vs. Yutaka, Yutaka meeting Taichi after all that time and the next route), the master of the wind would simply be God. And so, the howling of the wind on this rooftop, rather than being the Pretense, would be Coincidence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......ngh."

Occasionally, he does do something nifty.
//Same reaction as when he puts the Cross in Cross Channel, see CCA0030, ergo the significance should be similar. -GHS
Humanity was no longer,
but whether hope had gone as well, I have no idea.
//He knows what Sakuraba's doing... he just doesn't 'get' it well enough. -GHS
Despite this, seriously, this guy's... happy-go-lucky.
//Don't think this is the specific reference to the BGM, but it's in there somewhere at least. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's mate-ing."

[Sakuraba]
"Let's."

[Misato]
"...with pleasure."

[Taichi]
"To the ends of time."

The corners of Senpai's lowered, seemingly in happiness.

[Miki]
"Still, Kiri-chin, you don't look in spirits at all..."

[Kiri]
"I-, don't? That's not true you know?"

[Taichi]
"..."

I knew it, this is just forced, is it?
Were that truth and those acts still too much of a burden for Kiri?
//See Misato. There's still looots to go... -GHS
But.
In this world.... there is one more day and no more.
I have neither chances nor methods to heal Kiri.
//The all-consuming monster. He wants to hurt Kiri so bad he literally regrets not being able to help her further. Which telling her about Yutaka DID. -GHS
Therefore,
therefore---
