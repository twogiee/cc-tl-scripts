Three hands overlapped.
One was mine,
one was Tomoki's,
one was Sakuraba's.
It was nothing that intimate.
//*clicks stopwatch* 4 sentences to denial of tEh gaYz. So damn predictable. -GHS
Sakuraba and I had a history together.
Tomoki was a man on insufficient wit.
I was being I, for the first time having men as friends.
//This would exclude Yutaka, which is not quite true. -GHS
We are... different humans, therefore I arbitrarily decided we could never achieve anything like a connection.
//'Different' can indeed mean 'broken', but also simply the obvious: they are separate individuals. Plus, if you'll notice, two of the three should not have trouble of any sort by the standards of the school. And yet... -GHS
But I was wrong.
Us being different humans can also be the reason why we get on well with each other, as rider and horse fit each other.
//See CCD0002. Because it's been used with Taichi and Yutaka, who had close to a literal master/slave relationship in the past, and still got well together up to a point, literal would be important. -GHS
One thing bound us three people.
...that was Eros.
In the hours of hurried waiting that club activities became, unexpectedly Sakuraba let out a,
//Hurry up and wait. Seems to fit, given the random military stuff all the way from CCA0002, and how Misato runs things (by herself as much as possible). -GHS

[Sakuraba]
『Buruma are nice, ain't they.』

And with that muttering, the bud of the flower of friendship bloomed.
//This is both subtle and extraordinarily heterosexual. -GHS
We were not of the Buruma Generation.
//Ended a few years before, '96 according to unnamed sources that demand their secrecy (Wikipedia). -GHS
And that was exactly why that dreamy Fetish Garment made us go mad with longing.
'Cuz ya know, those Spats shorts're sooo boooring and stuff.
//Peter Payne wept. Tweaked to google. -GHS
And that is why---

[Trio]
"Although we have been born on a different day, we merely wish to graduate (from virginity and school) on the same day and the same time."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_the_Peach_Garden 願わん sounds negative, but comparing translation with the original it can't be so. -GHS

We made a vow in which we were to remain virgins until the time of graduation.
No stealing anyone's march.
To tell the truth, by this time I was already...
//He had likely had sex with Touko already, so all that happened at the mansion is moot. -GHS
But in my soul I was still cherry.
No problems there.
Later, it came to light that Sakuraba had le petite impotence, and Tomoki was a siscon.
//Seems to just be sarcastic. -GHS
Everyone had their problems.
But it didn't matter.
The point was that we wanted to make a Promise.
That we wanted to play pretend-a-friendship.
The ceremony for that memorable loss was decided to be a trip to the PeachLand.
//See CCZRooftop, a play on Peach Garden, above, and Soapland, the whorehouse of the type sometimes referenced... -GHS
Matebook was also proposed, too.
//I have no idea what these lines refer to, none whatsoever. They've been removed from every version; there's nothing copyrighted I can tell or callbacks to deleted stuff: following the new versions and removing. -GHS
The hands of three kept on overlapping, never showing a sign of parting.
And that was how the three of us began mate-ing.
