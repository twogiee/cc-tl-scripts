[Misato]
"Ah-, aeEeh~..."
//HACK leave the BG zoomed -GHS

Senpai had come.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Senpai."

Salutations from my stepladder-heightened location.
//You just know from the outset that this will be trouble... -GHS

[Kiri]
"...hi."

[Misato]
"Fwhaaahã€œ"

[Taichi]
"A barrage of moe we have here."
//See Nanaka. Misato's his third mommy after all. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But those two are kinda old."
//[Wish for moe words to have been standardized in the few decades of regular translations from Japan accompanied by sarcastic implication that the correct word is 'butchery' and not 'translation'] -GHS
[Taichi]
"For the Moekko of the 22nd Century ought be doing the Yuahhn, or the Yuyohhn and---"
//Fetishist technical term again. See below. -GHS

[Misato]
"Is that not just poetry from Nakahara Chuya? Are you plagiarizing?"

With a very sharp face.

[Taichi]
"...gah, you knew it."
//Particularly ironic considering CCB0002 -GHS

[Misato]
"So you like Nakahara it seems."

[Taichi]
"N-, nah, it is called learning from the past, or maybe the restoration of Imperial rule... it is an inquiry of the past to truly understand the future, or the like!"
//Thus spake Confucius (no, really, it's his). -GHS

[Misato]
"What in blazes does that even mean."
//Osaka-ben -GHS

[Taichi]
"Anyway... congratulations on your quick dehospitalization."

[Misato]
"Ahhh, the injuries were not that serious, that is why."
//Hey, just like Kiri's. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It does not hurt anywhere I hope?"

[Misato]
"...I am alright, but..."

She stares, fixed, at me.
I, also, fixedly stared at Senpai's beautiful boobs.

[Misato]
"Ah, uhm, why here with the antenna?"

She asked the question while covering her bust with both arms.

[Taichi]
"...just on a whim."

[Misato]
"A whim you say..."

[Taichi]
"A whim, for sure."
//See CCA0006 -GHS

[Misato]
"...mgh."

She had dissatisfaction on her face.

[Taichi]
"The perfect picture of health and furthermore wholesomeness that am I naught desires but to live in optimistic proactivity!"
[Taichi]
"And then shall I, at last, pervert my awful nature into that of a Young Adult that is experienced in the ways of the world, having tasted its bitter and its sweet!"
//This is the "innocent" meaning of the word hentai. -GHS

[Misato]
"Pe-, pervert?!"
//See above. -GHS

She embraces her bust furthermore.
Ain't that nice, Senpai.
You can go over your own boobs as muuuch as you liiike.

[Taichi]
"Not like that!"

On the other side of the antenna, Kiri lets a sigh drop to her feet.
//Oh, she's on the other side of the antenna here, too. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, right. We are chock full of questions we would like to ask!"

I take out the blueprint.

[Taichi]
"I do not really understand what this note here means."
//TMFGFHF FF tT FERGP l0hdhvZ badgers 6*29 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Once that is done, there is thing I would like to ask, President-senpai."
//Seems to be antenna related. Seems... -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, huh..."

[Taichi]
"Also, the batteries, what do we do?"

[Misato]
"Eh, from the cars parked outside the school... I think."
//Her first thought is pillaging parked cars. Damn thug. Except they still got some at school which they used from the training camp, see CCC3018. Odd she'd forget... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Welll, that is a man's work then. I shall dispatch Sakuraba."
//3xl. If that can't have multiple meanings, nothing can. -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh, but Sakuraba-kun is not necessarily going to help out..."

[Taichi]
"If he is told to help he will absolutely help! Maybe."
[Taichi]
"Because that guy only lives carefree."

[Misato]
"No, that is not what I...!"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

I understood Senpai's real intentions.
Club was something for her own flight alone.
With everyone there, Senpai's aridity could not be healed.
She was happy from the start that this would take time,
that there existed something in inexhaustible supply she could devote herself to.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"Say, Senpai, when we finish here and we send the SOS, is that the end of this?"
//See CCA0030, he's doing the same thing. -GHS

[Misato]
"Well, for the time being..."

The flight ends together with this.
That is why this girl here is doing this work alone.
So that it will never end.

[Taichi]
"We can send an SOS, but we will not necessarily have an immediate reply."
//HACK sweatdrop Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Uhhh..."

[Taichi]
"There's also a problem of directionality here..."
[Taichi]
"FM radios are not the only one, there are also hand-held transceivers in use, right?"
//The poor Kiri doll in the console version would be dancing around with her reaction to the wrong lines around here. She looks out-of-character and bored at best, mugging for the camera at worst. -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"Also, we must think about reception."
//On their side. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, right, that..."

[Taichi]
"This is just like a Broadcast Station then."
[Taichi]
"After broadcasting begins we must always but always maintain it until there is a reply."

[Misato]
"......ah."
//She understood -GHS

[Taichi]
"We will be busy!"

[Misato]
"......"

A tinge of redness on Senpai's face.

[Misato]
"Yes we will, definitely."
[Misato]
"Yes, we might..."
[Misato]
"Being busy is a nice thing to be, yes?"

[Taichi]
"Indubitably."
[Taichi]
"And with that, doing it with everybody will be fun."
//Indeed *adds 'mandatory harem ending' to the tags* -GHS
[Taichi]
"If we do it with people three, we'll finish in a day maybe?"
//screw it *chug* -GHS

[Kiri]
"...things are a little difficult over here. I do not understand at all."
//Seems to be antenna related. Seems... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh. If only there was a beautiful girl experienced with the mechanical."
//HACK someone forget to display the doll change. -GHS

[Misato]
"Why did you specify gender..."

And how conveniently, there was the patter-patter of a presence coming closer.
//She was possibly waiting for her cue... -GHS

[Miki]
"Kiri-chiiin, you heeere?"

The door opens and... Miki.

[Taichi]
"BINGO!"

[Misato]
"Eh... what is that?"
//It's NOT ping-pong, that's what it is. -GHS

I explained the situation.

[Miki]
"Wheeew, so wholesome this is!"

[Taichi]
"Your Hi-Tech Knowledge is necessary."

[Miki]
"PCs are one thing, but I dunno about wireless."

[Taichi]
"Ya got good grades don'tcha."

[Miki]
"Those are useless when it comes to specialized skills."
//TL Note: she just said school is useless for a job. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But you can understand even the hard books."

[Miki]
"Nooo, nonNnoNno..."
//Going with actual denial, not embarrasment due to line below -GHS
[Miki]
"What you are saying is that you want me added to the personnel..."

She gives a fleeting gaze to her accomplice.

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin's here too."

[Kiri]
"...sorry."
//Seems like a reverse CCC0027 -GHS

[Miki]
"No need to apologize, but... that's a surprise."
[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, what do we do with 'that' then?"

[Kiri]
"...sorry."

[Miki]
"Abort?"
//HACK earlier closed eyes Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"...yes. There are... several reasons."

[Taichi]
"What is this 'that'?"

'That'. The 'that' of innocent girls.
The secret 'that'.
//SPOILER: it's lesbianism. -GHS

[Miki]
"What are these reasons?"

[Kiri]
"Sorry, talking about that here is, well..."

A subject they do not want heard then.

[Miki]
"Uh-huh. Then..."
[Miki]
"Meow?"

She meowed.

[Kiri]
"...nyaaa."

[Miki]
"Meowwwmeow meow meow?"

[Kiri]
"...nyaaago."

[Misato]
"C-, Catspeak?"
//In TWO dialects! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Looks like it..."
//HACK to sky -GHS

We were terrified.
Standing away from the corner in which the two of us shook and trembled, while Miki and Kiri were meowing with nyans and meows.
Soon afterwards,
//HACK back to rooftop, normal Kiri -GHS

[Miki]
"I see... so is that what there was?"

They understood each other.

[Taichi]
"You got through to each other with that stuff!?"

Are the youngsters these days so creative they would construct a Selflanguage!?
//* Taichian for one's own personal language. Yeah, hypocrite much? Still, post-Babel. -GHS

[Miki]
"So then, so then, in the end if we do our nation-founding we'd have to do without an army, that's what happened."
//They're not having the real conversation now, however... are they? This might just be further hints to ensure the reader understands that the above doesn't need to be understood to be understood and wooo I'm going cross-eyed. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...yes. And that's why I don't think it's going to work anymore."

[Miki]
"But how about weapons not as an army, but as self-defense?"

That's just like that country, isn't it...
//I think it's Austria. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm just assuming, but I guess this conversation does involve me."
[Taichi]
"You have a knife too, Miki-chin, right? I'd throw that away if I were you."

[Miki]
"But it's so useful to have, you know."
//HACK panicky Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"Why do you even have a knife?"
//See CCC3010. Liar liar. -GHS

[Miki]
"Meeeow."
//HACK eyes closed Kiri. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, sorry."

[Taichi]
"That thing's reeeally useful, yes."
//Here he's referring to the catspeak. -GHS

What sort of grammar could it even have.

[Miki]
"Useful in every single possible scene of daily life."
//Watch it closely now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...oookay, so, well, if you don't give it over to Kiri you should be OK I guess?"

[Miki]
"Yes. That is how it'll be."
//"I'll only happen to drop off my crossbow where she can easily find it and use it. No giving of any knives!" But if there's no knives... there may be no crossbow. -GHS
[Miki]
"But ooooh, Kiri-chin and Senpai have made up... it's the end of the world it is."
//HACK not sure what this emotion is supposed to be anymore... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Well, made up, it's that..."

[Taichi]
"...we totally did."

[Miki]
"Uhhh-huh."
[Miki]
"Senpai, this way for a bit."
//HACK unzoom BG as well -GHS

Pulling my hand, she moves us away from the antenna,
to a position where we can't be heard by Kiri or Senpai.

[Taichi]
"...whassit?"

[Miki]
"I've heard the general outline, but,"

That Catspeak's amazing.

[Miki]
"Senpai, on your part, are you OK with this?"

[Taichi]
"'OK', meaning...?"

I don't quite get Miki's question.

[Miki]
"Of course Kiri-chin sees you just a bit... as not entirely nice, Senpai..."

[Taichi]
"She hates me. Just say that plainly."

[Miki]
"Ahahah... well."

Bitter smile.

[Miki]
"Truth is, she invited me to live together with her, just the two of us, away from everyone."
//Lies... although given Miki's manipulating her, that may be literally the truth. Interesting parallel with what Youko wants with Taichi, too. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh, but why?"

[Miki]
"Kiricchi doesn't trust humans, that's why. And with things have gotten this chaotic, she says it's dangerous to stay next to people like you, Senpai."

Wooow, nice insight, Kiri-chin.

[Miki]
"That's why... well... her and you, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"On how she sees me as a hypothetical enemy government."
//Sarcastic comment on how that part's obviously important, but also see CCC3007 - solitary islands isn't quite countries, but it's close enough. -GHS

[Miki]
"...yes."
//OTOH, Miki seems genuinely worried that it's Taichi who can't stand Kiri. -GHS

Shoulders drop.

[Miki]
"The reason... Kiri-chin never told me, but, it's been like this for some time."
//But how long has Miki been pushing Kiri against him...? After all, in your typical Settei, the Hero of Justice must confront the Evil Villain... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Miki]
"Lately, she's felt a bit neurotic, however."
//HACK doll was loaded on the wrong layer -GHS
[Miki]
"...can you get along with Kiri-chin when she's like this?"

So Miki asked, looking uneasy.

[Taichi]
"Yes, I promised to play nice with Kiri-chin, that's why I got Youko-chan to hold back."

[Miki]
"Hasekura-senpai... did she hurt you, Senpai?"
//The conversation sort of derails here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That one comes just out of nowhere, bam, no warning."
//{Ae}stethics -GHS

[Miki]
"Just like a hero, then."

[Taichi]
"Isn't that true. And me's heroine."
//If she's the hero, he's the heroine. So the villain... -GHS

[Miki]
"Your face does look girly!"
//See CCC3010, CCA0011C (but it's all over, really). -GHS

[Taichi]
"...that I've never seen as something lucky not once."
[Taichi]
"I get frightened and I get pushed down and I get all confused."
//Of course he could be talking about Youko, see CCC0000, but... -GHS

[Miki]
"...is that what it is?"

[Taichi]
"For a time, I didn't want to meet with anyone. I disliked conversing with people."
//Let's avoid such sentences as "want to see anyone". Why is he saying this to her, when the first time they met he was in gas mask...? This does look like a plot hole. -GHS

[Miki]
"Now it's totally the opposite however."

[Taichi]
"Because it's provisions."

[Miki]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"...because it's something necessary."
[Taichi]
"You might hate the food but if you don't eat, thing is, you'll be dying."
//See Touko. -GHS
[Taichi]
"There's many things inside of the heart, and they flow there based on the ways you eat."
//See CCA0018B. What's for eating... -GHS
[Taichi]
"I thought that it was the face to blame for why people don't think good of me. And I don't understand why, but my eyes keep bothering me."
//HACK doubty Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Eyes?"

[Taichi]
"It feels like my eyes are different from that of others... no, it also feels like my facial features aren't normal..."
//What were they talking about again...? Sometimes Tanaka just seems to get lost. -GHS

[Miki]
"They're trim and pretty. Not what you would call 'handsome' however."

[Taichi]
"That's just what everybody tells me."
//That his face his pretty, not that he's handsome. -GHS

[Miki]
"Hah-ah... is that the wound on your heart, Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"Mmmmh, this is sort of the cherry on top of the cherry on top, in truth..."
//Yes, it totally is. -GHS

Come on!, come on!, I remonstrate myself.
//No talking about the truth. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, on to proper business. For purposes of getting Youko-chan to withdraw, it is absolutely imperative that Kiri remain free of offensive power."
//HACK smiley Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"The conversation's so juuumpy."
//She notices the disconnection... maybe all the ones above too? -GHS

[Taichi]
"And therefore, I shall be borrowing Kiri-chin."

[Miki]
"Ah, uhm... please don't tease her OK? I do think she's fun to tease, but..."

[Taichi]
"...I will use my discretion."
//Oh look, now it's a direct reference to that scene... -GHS

[Miki]
"In that case I will be joining in, too."
//HACK fade to black -GHS

And this,
was how Miki also joined us.
