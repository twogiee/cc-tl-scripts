When I showed face in the classroom, Touko was there.
I was surprised, and stood still.

[Taichi]
"...Kirihara."

Her languid gaze was swimming vacantly, as if it were looking straight through to behind me.
Touko's cheeks were sunken.
Her complexion looked bad too.
Hair frayed as well.
The light of her life had become truly faint.
She lays her face on the desk, looking
disinterested.
Seems Touko has stayed like this, not touching
nor touched by anybody, rotting away.
She could perhaps not endure the shock,
of this world where mankind had ended.
Everybody, at the end, is alone in death.
But until death, it is out of the question
to not be living.
//This is the simpler sense of "stay alive". -GHS
I approached and called out to her,
as gently as I could.
Though this may have been hypocritical... it didn't matter.
Because I exist for the purpose of carrying out hypocrisy.

[Taichi]
"I know you can't really stomach it, but couldn't you try coming to Club starting tomorrow?"
//They redid the line for this script for whatever reason, more curious as this is her only line in that script. Probably forgot to tag it as dupe or something. -GHS

[Touko]
"...eh?"

Gluing puzzlement to bewilderment, she brought up her prostrate head.
Her emaciated features turned a bright scarlet, and left me with an impression in some respects tragic.

[Taichi]
"No?"

I put a bundle of sandwiches and the canteen on her desk,
the leftovers of the beach outing.
There's about enough for one person.
Touko stares at them intently.

[Taichi]
"You gotta eat slowly, the stomach won't accept it otherwise."

[Touko]
"...have no... appetite."

A husked voice.

[Taichi]
"Yeah I get it, so eat."

[Touko]
"......"

Slowly she reaches with her hands,
unwraps the package,
and gives tiny gnaws.

[Taichi]
"...slowly now. There's also water if you need."

[Touko]
"......ngh."

She covers her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Ah, you alright?"

[Touko]
"I'm alright, it's all good."

Shaken off.
Her behavior is feeble, but there is also an intent of rejection, definitely.

[Taichi]
"...Kiriharaaa."

The mood is awkward.

[Touko]
"I'll... take this yes."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Touko]
"So I'll eat it home."

[Taichi]
"Will you... you sure?"

[Touko]
"...yeah."
[Touko]
"Thank you."

Words of politeness flow smoothly from her mouth.

[Taichi]
"You know, me... I'm thinking of going to club on Sunday."
[Taichi]
"If you want to, you can come too."
[Taichi]
"We'll send out an SOS."
[Taichi]
"It doesn't look like the reach will be that extensive, though."
//Worrywart, it'll reach the other side of the world. -GHS
[Taichi]
"There's so many possible bandwidth and direction settings we could use after all."
[Taichi]
"Those will be new club activities, then."
[Taichi]
"...not bad innit?"

[Touko]
"...I'd say."

It felt that my bad relationship with Touko had mended, just a tiny bit.
