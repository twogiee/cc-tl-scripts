Returning home, I was made to carry Touko's bags.

[Taichi]
"...nghhh, ahhh."

[Touko]
"Fight on, Taichiii!♪"

[Taichi]
"Yeeeah."

I had no right of opposition.
//See CCC0000 -GHS
The bags were light,
but hills, therefore tiring.

[Touko]
"〜♪"
//Directions: "humming" -GHS

Cheerful ain't she.
But that angerlessness was a good thing.

[Touko]
"Say, Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"'es?"

[Touko]
"Are we really going to the beach?"

Ahhh.
She was looking forwards to it, that's why.
Because if there is something fun ahead, people are happy.
Even though all people are alone in their deaths,
and there is solitude in their existence,
they have the power to forget all that and look forwards to something pleasurable.

[Taichi]
"...shall we go?"

[Touko]
"Yes!"

[Taichi]
"What would you like: going just us two or going with a crowd?"

[Touko]
"Eh, crowd?"

[Taichi]
"Well, we'll only invite the people that want to come with."

[Touko]
"...do any want to, I wonder."

[Taichi]
"Do any indeed."

Sakuraba's alright.
//See CCA0011C. -GHS
How's Tomoki doing I wonder. Busy with the Survival Club I guess.
Misato-senpai has club activities I guess.
Miki's OK, probably.
Kiri's a harsh fog, but if Miki comes she should come with.
//That was the pun anyway. -GHS
Youko-chan's completely beside the point.

[Taichi]
"Some will come, I think."

[Touko]
"But Taichi, you... which do you prefer?"
[Touko]
"Going with everybody, or being alone us two."

I covertly dash my eyes to her profile for a flash of an instant.
Maybe it's being unused to love,
maybe it's being naive,
but I sincerely love this of her.

[Taichi]
"..."

And with that also considered, it seems that I might just like Touko quite a bit.

[Taichi]
"Hahah!"

[Touko]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Well, tomorrow we'll go with everyone, and Friday next week just with you, Touko."
//Well, not that next week. -GHS

A sudden shine in her face.

[Touko]
"Let's, that'd be good, yes."
[Touko]
"But we're going to need packed lunches."

[Taichi]
"...and I have to make them, right?"

[Touko]
"I'll help!"

[Taichi]
"Okay, but the Harakiri Blade is too long to fit in the kitchen at home."

[Touko]
"I'm not bringing it in there, it's a sword!"

But she'll be summoning it won't she...

[Touko]
"Hmmm, but can you gather everyone just from this hour?"

[Taichi]
"Once night falls, there is nothing to do anymore."
[Taichi]
"But me, I'm a creature of the night. I'm fine being in the darkness."

[Touko]
"So you're a night owl?"

[Taichi]
"...well, what I mean to say is a little different from that."
[Taichi]
"Look, just leave it all to me!"

[Touko]
"..."
[Touko]
"Say, how about I take half the bags."
//I'm not really sure how many bags Touko has and why she would bring more than one, even. Eh, woman, it's gonna be clothes somehow. -GHS

My oh my.

[Taichi]
"I'm fine, this isn't much."

[Touko]
"Then, I'll help you like this."

She linked arms.

[Taichi]
"Well then!"

[Touko]
"Heh heh heh!"
//Wait, is this the first time the actual noblewoman did a noblewoman's laugh? Voice disagrees so changed. -GHS

That ain't gonna be of any help at all...
Well, whatever.

[Touko]
"〜♪"

When I see a profile so filled with happiness, drenched in that sunset too red, my mischievous heart swells.
...a strong desire to lunge out at it all.
//Veeery vague here. -GHS
There is no hope in the last days of this world and us.
I close my eyes tight.
Sunset's not nice.
It's a color that makes me feel the destruction of the world.
//See CCA0017A -GHS
Long ago I used to to think, isn't the world just being destroyed once every day?
//And people say Cross Channel doesn't explain things explicitly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ah."

Above the hill,
//ka-misaka. -GHS
there she was.
The bicycle girl.

[Nanaka]
"............"

An arm extended, horizontal.
A fingertip, pointing to somewhere.
I looked.
A mountain?
Towards the camping area... and the mountain trail that leads there.
Returning my sight, the girl isn't there anymore.

[Taichi]
"......mother of...?"

[Touko]
"Next week, let's get our hair cut, both of us."
//And who's gonna cut them if there's only eight people and none of them is a barber, Ms. Obviously Expects A Professional Hair Cut? The subtle implication is that barbers still exist for her. -GHS
[Touko]
"Let's cut them short and be all refreshed. We'll have a healthy life full of smiles."
[Touko]
"We'll live like in rural America! And so, we'll eat corn for dessert."

[Taichi]
"Right."

Touko didn't seem to see her.
Even if she was straight and forwards ahead of her.
Somewhat freaky.
//There we go. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...say, why corn?"

[Touko]
"Do you know how it is eaten when presented at a formal dinner?"

[Taichi]
"Eh? With knife and fork?"
//Guessing "Corn is eaten with knife and fork" + "a formal dinner, you mean with knife and fork?". -GHS

[Touko]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Cutting that with a knife would be hard..."

[Touko]
"But what if it is presented as dessert?"

[Taichi]
"Welll..."
//3x -GHS

Touko giggles.

[Touko]
"Then you could just eat it with your hands!"

[Taichi]
"...so that's how it is."

[Touko]
"So, how do you think a banana is handled formally?"
//Just choke on innuendo and die. バナナ 八 (pretty much) +nana, seven. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Peeled by hand."

[Touko]
"Ha, you are disqualified!"

[Taichi]
"You'd cut it with a knife?!"

[Touko]
"Yup."

[Taichi]
"...whoooa, I dunno 'bout all dem manners!"
//dagnabbit -GHS

[Touko]
"If we live like that, the number of people will quickly increase."
//Specific. She delusionally believes that people ran away from her because she was mean. Similar to Kiri, difference is mostly in reaction. -GHS
[Touko]
"Because everyone will come back."

That is one way of holding onto hope.

[Taichi]
"Or possibly, we could be making more or something."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I ended up wanting to kiss her.
I dapperly lift her chin.

[Touko]
"...lech."

Gnaw!

[Taichi]
"OwChChCh! Don't gnaw my fingeeer!"

For dinner we ate canned food to our heart's content.
