But I have club don't I.
With Senpai's blueprints.
This sob-filled list of complaints is the problem at hand, and I want to believe that if these points are resolved, the system will become capable of signal transmission.
Senpai believes it.
Believe. What a beautiful word that is.
//Signal transmission: 発+信 "send out" + "believe". Naturally, as random as a reference to a 1975 Turkish movie about leprechauns in Cross Channel. -GHS
There is so much there to dampen the dryness, to quench a thirst.
//HACK zoom -GHS
Beginning work.
//See CCX0001 -GHS
Fatigue duty continues under the scorching sun.
I am extraordinarily resistant to sunstroke,
because my hair is white.
//He can drive: he has studied racing mangas. -GHS
That alone makes quite the difference.
Today may be a Manatsubi, with its temperature likely above 30 Celsius, but work continues.
//THIS IS EDUTAINMENT BITCHES AND YOU! WILL! LEEEEEARRRRRNNNN!!!asdsafdfdaskldies -GHS
Soon afterwards,

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

Isn't that Kiri?
Standing at the edge of the fence, gazing at the landscape.
Did she not notice me?
That can't be. I'm making very loud noises working here.
//Or Kiri also pretends not to hear... or see. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Heeey, Kiriii!"

I call to her.
Kiri walked to me at a loose, easy pace.
//She noticed him, she was just... sort of there. -GHS

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Well... it's not like I have anything in particular in mind..."

Kiri glanced, seemingly disinterested, up at the antenna.

[Kiri]
"...you are really doing this club thing then."

[Taichi]
"Ehhh well."
[Taichi]
"But with this heat I actually wanted to go to the beach."
[Taichi]
"We went last year. Remember that?"

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"That was so fun! Too bad about Miki, though."

[Kiri]
"...yes."

Frightfully docile, isn't she.
Or should I say, things are weird.

[Taichi]
"...what is it?"

[Kiri]
"It's... Hasekura-senpai, she..."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan... she's monitoring you?"

[Kiri]
"Y-, yes..."

Kiri's hands are trembling,
despite her being so stout-hearted a girl.
She's frightened.
She had withered beyond recognition.
//HACK raised eyebrow Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"And that,"
[Kiri]
"And that..."

Voice shakes.
I couldn't look at her.
//Here's the next step that pushes him to go try be Alter Egos with her later: she's being bullied... by Youko. The irony is so very deep. -GHS
Because she was immature an immature girl, and yet so like a beautiful glass sculpture.
Because she had this fragility, that to touch was to make her filthy, and to grip was to shatter her.
But what to do with something this... half-baked.
//"I know! Let's give 'er another half!" -GHS
I feel resentment towards Youko-chan.
Ahhh, don't sink down again, you.
I prefer times where the tension can be kept high.
In times where it can't, my heart sinks.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
To somewhere deep.
An abyss that sunlight doesn't reach.
//The Marianas Trench. ...uhm wait -GHS
A place that makes you forget all the light, that swallows whole all that desires but to live as an Individual.
//Sounds like the Nietzscheian abyss, the one that stares back. -GHS
A place where this thing called a heart is unnecessary.
//The difference between "living alone as Individual" and "accepting there is no permanence in Crossing" is so very fine... -GHS
Being there for long eventually makes this frozen heart degenerate into a pure volition to live.
//Will to Power. -GHS
There's this hallucination that I am as if something that lives deep beneath the seas.
//Water metaphor... continues! Also see CCA0030 ("full starboard"). -GHS
That, I think, would also be good.
For example, if I were to be by myself in this world alone,
I would have no need to hurt anyone.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Kiri, help with club."

The sudden proposal made Kiri's pupils turn circular.
//HACK flustered Kiri instead -GHS

[Kiri]
"Activities?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."
[Taichi]
"...alone I... can't finish this and... help me please..."
//Sorta broken -GHS

I thrust, unaltered, the complaints I inherited from a Senpai onto an underclassman.
Because there also exist the expectation within myself that via making Kiri work on top of the stepladder the blessed event that is the Foundation of Panchiraland will occur.
//See CCB0005 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Panchira's nice..."
//HACK normal Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"What... did you just say right then?"

[Taichi]
"The antenna is an E-plane type, you know."
//Uncertain as it's less than trivial to find the technical stuff in either language. Should be the correct term, however, meaning it's omnidirectional. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I heard 'panchira' however."

[Taichi]
"I haven't said such things."
//Intentional -GHS

I whistle.

[Kiri]
"...what... should I do here?"

[Taichi]
"You will help, then?"

[Kiri]
"Is this not an order?"

[Taichi]
"...ahh, wellll, that iiis..."

[Kiri]
"As I want to return what I borrowed in full, I will help."
//Like with the end of Touko's route, this makes zero sense if one hasn't gone to help her. Flat-out plot hole in this case. OTOH... she doesn't believe her debt cleared; of course, she doesn't understand the concept of 'repayment' any more than she understands forgiveness. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Weeee."

[Kiri]
"That said!"

She intercepts my speech and conduct with strong tone.

[Kiri]
"I have absolutely not a shred of intention to reconciliate."
//This is where readers should laugh. Deeere dere dere (that's the laugh for when tsunderes go deredere) -GHS

[Taichi]
"'s fine 's fine."
[Taichi]
"That is life as well!"
//HACK normal Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"Instructions, please."
//Similar, but not quite, to CCA0015 -GHS

[Taichi]
"So well, first have a look at this."

I handed over the blueprint.
Her face tightened, severely.
And after a minute, it had become a grimace---
//See CCA0016. Heh. -GHS
