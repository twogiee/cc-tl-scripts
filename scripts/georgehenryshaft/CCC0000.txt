           These are the recollections
          of that which is so far gone.
       The date alone vague and indistinct,
    laying at the heart of a dim distant haze.
               A grandiose bedroom,
          draped in aristocratic grace.
        Inside there were a canopied bed
          and a chair of European make.
//No repeat furigana, not that it's odd in any way generally. But the absence of furries is unaccPETtable! -GHS
       But sitting on the floor was always
               what I preferred.
          Especially on days like this.
          The starry heavens are a dark
         curtain visible from the window,
       a scattering of twinkles cut off by
      the frame that absconds with my sight.
     In the glass that segregates the outside
       world from the interior of the room,
           the reflection of my shape.
   A young lady kept secluded from the world---
      A maiden with the appearance of grace,
       the skin clothed in a Western dress.
        You... who could you possibly be?

[Girl]
"...Taichi."

A transparent outline shaded off... by silver hair.
//Silver (grey) doesn't match his description of "pure white". Later on we'll see this may be false. -GHS
A length that hangs down to surround the waist, its tips undulating loosely.
The face is tiny. A body and a head just as if a doll.
『Otherworldly looks.』
Who was it, even, that said that.
Maybe it was one of the madams, maybe it was one of the higher ranking sisters.
//...the takeaway is suspiciously "whorehouse", but let's say they're just old-fashioned Yakuza, and they live in what seems like a Western castle for, uhm, reasons. -GHS
A voice of sweetness that enchants the ears.
//Compare the view from the ridge. Even the up-right angle of the trees is similar. -GHS
The memories of the time that came before ten years had passed after my birth are in many ways a muddied trance-like dream.
//MEMORY HUNTER -GHS
『Come over here now, let's play.』
No volition of opposition.
The clothes of a girl, the mannerisms of a girl, the verbal affectations of a girl.
//And that's why some sentences would need to be girlier, so it's more obvious what exactly it means for Taichi to turn girly when he panics. -GHS
The ones that work at the estate as well as the elegantly refined lords who reside in it held the possibly noble, possibly childish hobby of playing with human dolls, which to me held tedium but not unpleasantness.
I think that could be said to be the reason, in the end,
for why the reflection of my figure on the window frame was always that of a girl.
//Whether that reflection is a different person to him or not, however, who knows! -GHS
Yes, there is merely one single thing that I recall. Clearly, I mean.
Among the many girls of tender and young age, there was only one that did not smile.
She, alone, never once played with me.
The outwards of a girl that services as a member of the tea party, the forms of the "me" that was yet young and manly, always were displayed in frankness.
//Hopefully that's all that's needed... -GHS
The girl that strolls alone in the vast garden sent me a gesture as if possibly of scorn, casually, via a flicker of a gaze.
With eyes of a clear black that reminds of obsidian.
//黒曜石 Obsidian contains 黒 the Kuro from Kurosu and 曜 the You in Youko. Fortunately only used once, see CCC3008, and not with the kanji pun. -GHS
Discomposure.
//Taichi's so masochistic that he falls for the first girl to look down at him. -GHS
Whenever my gaze turns her way, my heart turned to panic.
Delight perhaps, shyness perhaps.
Perhaps both, perhaps.
To me, who had almost never experienced agitation, runaway emotions, impossible to control, are uncommon.
And still, outwardly, I lavished the ladies with serene smiles.
//Learning hypocrisy. This is why he doesn't express much emotion if not in a rather fake manner, as that's what's expected from others; this explains CCE0001. -GHS
I am expected to understand my role.
My role... was to devotedly be a doll.
For the sake of living.
In that doll era there never was a conversation with her.
//There were words, though. See CCC3025. -GHS
Not even once.
The figure of a girl standing detached, in an isolated location, left behind a strong impression.
I learned, afterwards,
the she was bought, sparing no expense, and she was also a doll.
//Except this doesn't fully mesh with CCC3025, where she's the daughter of one of the servants there. Why would they buy her when the father is a Hasekura (possibly sent in exile) and the mother is dead (or rather was made to die)? -GHS
With alarming chill, the mood swirled into an eddy.
//Will recur. -GHS
The open air of the corridor had frozen.
I turned around and, right next to a door that had opened without a sound,
there she stood.
You who stand above---
//Focus is on individuality, distance, possibly rulership (less common meanings of 'kimi'). -GHS
And yet, what has she been doing?
The girl standing in front of my eyes was dirty all over.
No,
she had been filthied. And in ways unscrupulous and vicious.
Her clothes torn. Her white skin ran all over by scratches and abrasions.
Next to the lip, a darkening streak of blood.
//Was she working out that hard? ...or was she already being abused? If so, then was Taichi also being abused all the way back here? -GHS
Violent shaking.
Vision undulating.
//This isn't the reaction of someone who's seen a girl just working out hard... 'course, it could just be his misunderstanding. -GHS
In the era of the doll, full of ridiculousness but also of happiness,
there was no coexistence between me and her.
Memories are confusing and disordering.
//Perhaps one of the few outright truths throughout the VN... -GHS
Yes... in other words... for the individual she is began to be here, that means...
//ここに (individual/ly) + ここ に (to be here), I won't be using it too often as it's sort of distracting, but this does recur and it is a theme. -GHS
The noisy wives and young ladies, the youthful servants...
In my recollections, those days as sweet as confectionery are already speeding up and passing.
All the scenery loses its tint, deteriorating to a dull ash gray.
This is the era where she opens the door and comes inside the room.
That is not the era of the doll,
it's much later...
This is the era where me and her were given nothing but one single room.
//Why? Isn't this odd? -GHS
The stage moves from heaven to hell.
//Not only are heaven and hell important, so will the stage. See CCC4009, CCD5001. -GHS
As I notice, the furniture surrounding me had been removed and supplanted by a featureless gray wall.
//Which is conspicuously brown. But then again, his hair weren't silver right now. -GHS
A plain bed,
sheets just somewhat filthy,
a bare bulb for light,
a floor of splintering wood.
The beautiful silk curtains hang down like house rags, as fallen as our social position.
//Why would the put silk curtains in this obvious servant's room in the attic? -GHS
The heartbreaking, gloomy, cowardly bottlenecking of a life still at its early stages.
Those circumstances bundled two together who had never really spoken.
//There WERE words, so this means there wasn't proper conversation (which is true). -GHS

[Girl]
"Taichi."

A young male's name, mine.
//~adapt, adapt, adapt that boku~ -GHS
The ladies took the 'ta' kanji away from my too manly name, kept the 'ichi', and added one very female kanji at the end in exchange to make the name they called me with:
Ichiko. One-princess.
//Many pronunciations, but this seems to be the girliest. Another of interest is Hitomi, "pupils". This is a reference to 一姫二太郎 "ichihime nitarou", meaning "it's good to have a girl first then a boy". 太 is the kanji in Taichi's name. 一姫二太一　first a princess, then a Taichi: nice symmetry there. Plus it totally looks like a boy and a girl wanting to go their separate ways, but somehow double-bound together: very much like Taichi and Youko. Speaking of, see CCD5001: she also was a princess... -GHS
It is elegantly refined.
She alone has never called me with that name, not once.
//Which brings the question... if this is their first chat, as it's heavily implied, when exactly did she call him this? Certainly not when he lived in the grandiose bedroom, like at the top and CCA0001. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Want to drink something?"
//She's about to give him a blowjob... -GHS

Without answering the asked question she shortened the distance between herself and me.
And then, very naturally, pushed me down on the bed.
//This doesn't match the clothes she'll have in CCC3025 (though the CG in that is much later) -GHS

[Girl]
"..."

Touching closer and closer.
In the gap, silence floats,
to the point where even breathing could stop.
A sweet scent.
It is neither perfume nor soap.
Just the smell of her own body.
It rises from beneath a beastly smell so nauseatingly grassy, denying and canceling it all.
//See CCB2015. Uhm, everybody knows that smell of freshly cut grass that's not bad at the start but after a while gets, well, nauseating right? -GHS
Her lips like petals, soft, extrude a gentle voice.

[Girl]
"Everyday, painful?"
//There it is. -GHS

I thought a little, then answered honestly.

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Girl]
"Hurts?"

[Taichi]
"It hurts!"
//He could mean "what you're doing to me now" -GHS

[Girl]
"No one coming to rescue you?"

[Taichi]
"No. There's no more of the nice people.

[Girl]
"Wrong. There were none from the start."

She said that coldly, in a complete reversal.
With no hostility nor even hatred.
Exclusively and only with coldness.

[Taichi]
"But the old masters..."

[Girl]
"Those people were merely weak."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Girl]
"If they had room in their cramped hearts, then there were times when they would look on kindly."
[Girl]
"But as soon as it got painful for themselves, they ran away."
[Girl]
"...leaving behind even their precious toys."

Both her hands were placed on my shoulders,
and grip. With strength.

[Girl]
"There are no allies. No one will rescue you. Protecting yourself by yourself is the only way."

[Taichi]
"..."

True.
But sad.
That is what reality is.
Weak children become prey.
Dark desires to extents unbelievable exist in the heart of this world.
//vs. want -GHS
Both the young boy that I am and the girl that she is know that.
We have no strength, the two of us, and therefore must defend ourselves with wisdom.
Because, as far as the law is concerned, "they" are our guardians.
However, what if that guardian is the aggressor?
There can be no opposition.
//See above. -GHS
The mansion and the grounds are so big.
Whatever is done there, there is no leaking their deeds to the outside.
We are---
Slaves, no more.
A white hand is laid onto my cheek.
Her face drew nearer.
My heart fluttered fast, just a little.
Yet she stroked one spot of the cheek, seriousness on her face.
//See CCA0023. Hello parallels. -GHS

[Girl]
"...burned by a lit cigarette?"

[Taichi]
"A bit, yeah."
[Taichi]
"But I smeared it with cream beforehand."

Protecting yourself by your own wisdom is the only way.
//Interestingly odd apparent inconsistency here. Didn't she just 'teach' him...? -GHS

[Girl]
"An apology."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Girl]
"I cannot rescue you."

I was puzzled.
//dunno what IRC bots have to do with this -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's fine, because you too..."

After that words did not come out.
For she as a girl was going through much harder times than me as a boy.
I was hugged.

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Girl]
"Taichi... Taichi."
//See said scene again. This is like a bad copy of Nanaka's behavior. Now see CC3012B. -GHS

Her voice shook.
So rare. When she's always so composed.

[Girl]
"Taichi..."

Her lips pushed with force close to my ear. A trembling long breath is blown into the ear.
A stimulus like electricity climbed my spinal cord.
The center of my hips becomes excessively hot.

[Taichi]
"!?!"

Abrupt pressure on that one part.
//This is where Youko truly differs from Nanaka... -GHS
Her hand.
Her one hand, pressing down.
A strong pressing force from above on the one part that had stiffened.
I twitch, incapable of staying still.

[Girl]
"Taichi, we are weak."

Radiance in her deep black eyes.
Pinned down, powerless, that I can't make even the feedback noises of understanding expected in Japanese.
//Hmmm, rumors say most readers won't know Japanese, so specifying. -GHS

[Girl]
"That's why we just must join our forces."

[Taichi]
"Forces?"

[Girl]
"One heart, one body. Alter egos."

[Taichi]
"Alter egos..."

[Girl]
"If we do that, then we will be able to stand the pain just a bit more."
//The better question is: where the hell did she get this idea? I know metaphorically this is just Taichi giving in to temptation and sin, but I wonder if there's supposed to be some actual ideological root to this. -GHS
[Girl]
"I am Taichi, Taichi is me."

The lips, as they spin these words, descend quietly.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

Astonishment, chaos, and a very small amount of embarrassment.
//Cheerio. -GHS
A mix that makes me forget all motions.

[Girl]
"Tai... chi..."

A sweet, viscous fluid flows into the oral cavity.
It melts the frozen thing that I was.
Distancing the lips, she strips off her top garments.
Taking my breath away.
Her bare naked skin the color of a moonlight that denies all the evidence of sins,
//The wounds described below. See CCA0021. But most importantly, are they the same as the ones above? -GHS
and her noble gorgeousness,
and her limbs immersed in shafts of silverlight poured obliquely move in mysterious ways, making her resemble a living sculpture,
//The kanjis for 神秘 ("mystery) are "God" and "secret". It will of course return juuust in specific appropriate places, meaning that lateral is likely the intended reading. This is more than a bit conspicuous, but sounds less silly than a literal translation anyway ("mysterious limbs"???). The movement indicated is difficult to describe even with more space; it's the smooth, unnatural robotlike motion of something that looks human but is being moved by e.g. motors. Definitely on the other side of the uncanny valley. The point is in this CS Lewis quote: "This world is a great sculptor’s shop. We are the statues and there’s a rumor going around the shop that some of us are someday going to come to life." -GHS
all affronted insulted disgraced by countless minute cuts.
And yet, despite all that,
I... I thought... I thought she was beautiful.

[Girl]
"I am Taichi, Taichi is me."

The flow of her words is clearly, brightly etched onto my recollections, as if they were the scars of fangs that had bit into my memory.
//Visuals -GHS
A trembling in the inhuman shine in her eyes showed a chink in her armor.
//She's as terrified of him right now as Taichi is of Kiri when he "breaks" her by telling her Yutaka was a rapist. -GHS

[Girl]
"I am sorry..."
[Girl]
"Because I can trust myself, and nothing else."
//Contrast Nanaka's line. -GHS

Delicate fingertips apply themselves to my chest.
A tickling sensation crawled around on the pit of my stomach, and the upper half of my body was then bared.

[Taichi]
"Youko... chan..."

Weekday, child. That is how her name is written.
//I'm sure in a world where the week is actually a day, the #1 likely character to not exist (that we're not explicitly told about) having this name is not relevant, especially in the light of how Touko - the Winter Child - has the problem of melting. Don't find this interesting, and don't fill my bank account with all your money either. -GHSighReversePsychologyNeverWorks
Those are the words I finally managed to squeeze out.
Loving caresses began.
Pale pink petals, drawing serpentines on my pale breast.
//Snake because cross channels is the bible games and youko is satan -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh..."

A touch as if the teasing of a feather and my muscles, incontrollable, grind and quiver.
A thin path of transparent slimy fluid is left behind the passage of the lips.
//What is up with all this passing of saliva...? It's a fetish as it returns, but given most of those have a point here... -GHS
Her head gradually proceeds downwards.
Before long, it crawls inside my skirt.
Fingertips wound into my underwear, and drop them to the ankles.

[Taichi]
"..."

I wordlessly cover my eyes with one arm.
What reaction should I have in a situation like this?
What kind of sounds should come out of me?
I don't know.
It's just... hot.
I am kissed on the inner thigh.

[Taichi]
"...ah."

My body lept upwards like an ayugashi.
//Ohhh, this one's odd. The 'jumping' is more of the animate fish, the term more of the confectionery. Overcomplicating this by putting both ("my flesh jumped like a sweetfish and ended up in the pose as the sweetfish confectionery is anyone still reading this?") is out of the question. I'll go with ayagushi as it reads and googles better than wakaayu, while I curse Kinoko Nasu's name out loud for reasons that should hopefully be obvious. CURSE YOU KINOKO NASUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU -GHS
Moving left and right evenly, blowing in vast amounts of heat, her mouth rubs and nuzzles saliva in the area between my thighs.

[Touko]
"Ngh..."

I'm diligently smeared with dampness.

[Youko]
"Hah... hahfh... nhmh..."

Her exhalations seclude and swell my lust, filling the inside of the skirt with its warm excitement.
And even more than that, the whole of the body possessed heat.

[Taichi]
"Hot..."

[Youko]
"Nnh, fWah... nhmh... nh..."

Her absurdly unreasonable licking to the lower half my body removes all strength.
I want to surrender to the pleasure.
Moving is also problematic.

[Youko]
"...nh... nhFh... nMh..."

A sound as if a cat lapping up water.
The numbness turns into a wave and reaches the upper body.
//Hum, if with Touko it was 疼 (sick+winter), and with Youko it's 痺 (sick+despicable), then... -GHS
It goes on and on at length overwhelming me to the brink of unconsciousness.
Inevitably, the carnality washing ashore from the lower part of the body came to a sudden end.

[Taichi]
"Ah...?"

The reflexes of my body have been long since separated from the control of rationality.
However, in that same area how there is one organ throbbing with sensitivity.
//>h<ow. だけど一箇所だけ. 疼 hmmm. -GHS
There is a crude pulsating motion that I yet know.
It is different from the compulsory sensation given by the adults.
That deed was one that chilled the heart from the very core, a painless act that never went beyond the abuse.
//With the implication that he was abused, but in ways less than perfectly clear. -GHS
So hot.
So hot all over.
So hot between the thighs.
As if to melt.

[Taichi]
"Youko... chan..."

I mixed a tint of nagging in the voice, it was unavoidable.
I thrust the hips out to ease the frustration.
The tip, angered, cleaves nothing but air.
Contact is avoided. From inside the skirt.

[Taichi]
"Gonna come...!"

[Youko]
"..."

Keeping the body still is impossible.
The limbs move, squirming, stirring.
I might even look hideous.
And then,
her tongue accompanies itself to the pole's root without excessive teasing.

[Taichi]
"G'H!"

[Youko]
"Nh... nnh, nnnhhh..."

Tracing the muscles, crawling, stretching saliva everywhere.
//Visuals, at this point -GHS
Her tongue as if a living thing.
Stretching and twining like a snake, squeezing with strength.
//Of course Youko is a snake. -GHS
I do not know which of the loving caresses is causing that illusion inside of the skirt that I can't see.
Bound at the root, the semen has no place to go.
//This doesn't seem like dicks work... but since there's no refractary period in these damn nukige... -GHS
An amount of heat that lurks in the nether region, swirling in an eddy.
The tongue, coiling helically, finally reaches the pointed tip.
//whoa, that's a real word? -GHS
No way. She can't be thinking this.
But in these unavoidable thoughts of carnality, the flesh quivered.
And then,
I was in her mouth.
I realized that this was a physical contradiction.

[Youko]
"Nnh."

A mute plosive sound resonates as if to cancel out the concern.
There is no mistake, she's sucking it.

[Youko]
"Nh... aHfh... nnnh... nhWah... nmh... nnnnnh."

My filthy organ is inside the mouth of the girl that was always beyond my aspirations.
My spine shivers without stop.
It is no coldness nor fear, but an unmistakable fit of pleasure.
//See CCA0004. Yep. -GHS
I made myself accept this by thinking that she had become as if a youkai, an apparition.
//I wonder if a youk (suspicious pause) ai is relevant to Youko. -GHS
An essence-sucking demoness.
//Not quite the same as CCB0002, but close enough to be interesting, considering it's Youko vs. Nanaka. -GHS
The punishment for the me who did not reject the forms of a woman.
//Curiously enough, Taichi seems to think of this as some kind of atonement. -GHS
Therefore, whatever unreasonable thing would be happening below the garments worn between belly and footwear is nothing strange.
Perhaps the tip of the tongue is forked, perhaps it's coiling around like a vine, I don't know.
//Snake? SNAAAAKE! fucking metal gears... -GHS

[Youko]
"Hah... nh... nHnHnH... nnnnh, nnh..."

Her hands twine around the legs.
The earnest loving caresses of her mouth grow more and more intense.

[Taichi]
"Don't... don't, please..."

The limit was surpassed long ago,
and yet, the full stop is not struck.
It's because the very base is tied up maybe, that although the unopposable impulse has visited yet, that the physical end has not come.
//See CCD5001, naturally. -GHS

[Youko]
"Hfhnh, nhmh, nnnh, nhnh, nMh."

The torture that is the suction becomes even more intense, disallowing relaxation.
I screamed.
I felt I was going insane.
As I expected, she was pressing on the lower half of my body and firmly.

[Youko]
"...nnnnnnh."

And more sucking.
While the neck and the head twist left and right in complicated motions, the stalk sandwiched between the lips feels as if uprooted.

[Taichi]
"AAAH!"

Her head smoothly comes loose.
Simultaneously, bound and restrained as I was, I was softly untied.

[Taichi]
"Ugh..."

In an instant there will be climaxing.
The brute I think to release,
//The beast is Taichi's diiiick -GHS
but,
her hands move much faster.
The fingertips, in the gap between the two dirtied organs, exerted strong pressure.
//Assuming that's his dick and her lips. Because I like to make an ass out of u, ming. -GHS
With that flat place pressed down, somehow, the fluids spin and coil at the root.
The beast in liquid state is with simplicity exorcised and domesticated.
The beast I absolutely cannot command her hands tame easily.
//Visuals. Different term from sentence above. See CCA0017A... though it's more of a contrast than a similarity, since Youko thinks she can command him in ways well beyond the mere aiding him to control his instincts. -GHS
My pleasure,
and my pain as well,
are her obedient sycophants, their original master estranged.
//See CCC4022. -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

Her face, faintly blushing, eyes moistened, was hardening with the determination of one cornered.
//This may be what CCD5001 is referring to. -GHS
It's chilly below the waist.
It got wet.
Perhaps the saliva she spat, perhaps my sweat, perhaps yet another bodily fluid.
I did not understand and it did not matter.

[Youko]
"Taichi, let us become one."

My dress, so ostentatious, she strips off me with roughness.
//Assuming that if she were to actually rip it there'd be hell to pay. -GHS
Straddling on her knees, she stares at me.

[Youko]
"......"

Wordlessly.
A vivid, clear, tragic determination reflected in both her eyes.
Bending forwards, the lips meet.
//She just gave him a blowjob, though without ejaculation! Still interesting to compare with what he did to Touko, see CCB2101. -GHS
A violent osculation.
From a contact no more than a peck it leads quickly to a melding of membranes.
She inclines her head and leans in her body weight so that it would be a deep, membranous kiss.
Suddenly the tongue is seized and entangled up to the base, and dragged into the opposite oral side all at once.
//See CCA0025C. -GHS
Moving and bending back and forth the two tongues hug each other, flesh rubbing, nuzzling.
The saliva of two turns into large clumps and overflows from the lips.
Playbiting each other's lips, alternatively taking turns and fighting.
My tongue, sticking out with length, vanishes in the space between her lips.
For so long. As if inside a bog with no bottom.
Entrapped into the delusion of being extirpated from the bottom, the hips leap up unconsciously.
The brain scorches.
Thoughts disappear.

[Youko]
"Fwhanh..."

This time, the tongue of the other side sharpens to a point and inserts into the space between my lips.
My heart's palpitations increased, as if telling her to do as she pleases.
I try to imitate the sucking from the other side.
Our excited nasal breathing reciprocally caresses our faces.

[Youko]
"Nfh... ah, nnnh."

Intoxicated she closes her eyes, and submits to me.
With both arms I hold her head in a tight embrace, trying to sip down all inside my mouth.

[Youko]
"Nnnnnh!"

Around then,
she purred with coquetry. Throatily.
Hurriedly I severed my own animal desires.
The pale peach pink flat that comes out trails a viscous tail from its tip.
Youko-chan was smiling while protruding her tongue.
//Honorific fixed in the console version. -GHS
So long...
She had shown she had a skill with it so incomparable with the ordinary, and now it dangles long from out her mouth, longer than a finger.
Dripping drool dangles from beneath both our chins.
It's the overflowing saliva we forced out of each other.
Filthying is good, too.
//"Defilement" we'll reserve for one of the maaany variations for "rape". This will return. Many many many times. -GHS
The awareness I have in regards of my own sexual nature broke a bit.
//"I realized sex is dirty", but also, "my gender awareness broke somewhat". -GHS
To make a partner filthy, and in this way even,
is delightful.
Soul mates must make each other filthy.
Through information I was acquainted with the touch of the opposite gender,
//"I read a lot of porn, and by that I mean played a lot of eroge". -GHS
but what I learned is that it had been ornate, a tale more than reality.
//He might say this with the tone of a fairy tale, but, he's never touched by a girl. But isn't he the straight male right-hand for Yutaka's dad? This makes no sense, and it's not clear whether it's certain. -GHS
Perhaps grasping that tiny transformation, a seductive smile passes over her mouth.
//More importantly, not only is she a virgin (see CCC3025), but he's never even kissed a girl. What exactly is going on at these parties that the two obvious rape victims don't seem to have been raped at all? -GHS

[Youko]
"...what do you want to do?"

I said.
//Intentionally ambiguous which line it binds to. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I wanna enter you."

She smiled.
And then...
          Me and her became connected.
//A sort of childish kana-written "bokura". -GHS
