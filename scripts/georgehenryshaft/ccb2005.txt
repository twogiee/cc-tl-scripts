I enter the classroom.
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS

[Touko]
"Ah, Taichi..."

She came running over to me,
As if wanting to ask me if I would prefer a bath, or dinner, or perhaps...
//damn waifus. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'll be taking a bath while I have dinner."
//ゆ。 -GHS

[Touko]
"...fwha?"

[Taichi]
"'Morning."

[Touko]
"Mo-, 'morning."

[Taichi]
"So you really did come."

[Touko]
"Seems like I did, yes!"

[Taichi]
"...the bags?"

[Touko]
"Home."
[Touko]
"So, shall we go home together?"

[Taichi]
"Lee-et's."

Hmmm, yes.
A malaise, I should say.
The same feelings of a 22 year old playboy that hasn't played enough and is now forced into a wedding due to an unplanned pregnancy.
//Now, if I recall correctly, 21 in eroge years is 16 in real years; Taichi is actually 17, see CCC4015. His birthday, therefore, has to be between April and September: wanna bet it's July 7th? -GHS

[Touko]
"For the baggages, I was wondering, oh what should I bring with, so I went searching all over."
[Touko]
"And guess whose old photos turned up?"
//rethronical. Also rethorical, but that's not a real word. -GHS

She says that looking happy.

[Taichi]
"Huh, old pictures aren't they."
[Taichi]
"I have plenty of old photos, as well."
//Bit flat, but connects better below. -GHS

[Touko]
"Really? You really kept them!"

[Taichi]
"..."

I have plenty of old (illegally non-censored) photo(book)s, as well.
I did not tell a lie.
//THIS IS A READING KEY! he shouted. -GHS

[Touko]
"So glad I didn't throw them away... I'm thinking of sticking them to a wall."
[Touko]
"Until the wall is all buried in them!"
//See CCD4003. Whoops. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Haaahum..."
//????????????????? -GHS

I display astonishment.

[Touko]
"Heh heh!"

She linked her arm with mine.
Evolving too faaast!
Dammit, I knew it, this female...
//Creepier -GHS
I extract an [ITEM] from the tools bag.
* Tools bag = Taichian promotional item, called the Taichi
  Bag. It comes in the shape of a canvas back-pack.
  Within, many secret implements are found.
//Lines merged. Together with the Taichi Doll, the guy seems really trying to sell his image or something. He must've misunderstood, though, they sell figurines/dakimakuras/stuff of THE HEROINES of eroge, not of the protagonists. See CCC3004 -GHS
And then I unhesitatingly Equipped it!
//This works better with the lines merged, still RPG-like Equip. This seems to give +0 towards Tsunderes. -GHS
HACK independent BG shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"Look at this, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"An arm band?"

The young lady looks quite closely.
//See CCA0001 -GHS

[Touko]
"...syrupples... ostracized..."
//Syrup + couples. Terms should be tough enough that it sounds vaguely credible she'd strain a bit to read them. -GHS
[Touko]
"Syrupples ostracized."

So finally reads Touko.
//(overliteral translation with tongue-in-cheek TL note excised... THIS TIME.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed. I have gravely seen the enormity of the impact of Syrupples on the environment, and with manners most firm, I now strive for the position to regulate and furthermore curb said impact."
//See CCD2002 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Cease this arm linking!"

I shake her off.

[Touko]
"It-, it's always like this I know but... what are you even saying, I don't understand."

[Taichi]
"One ought to be most discreet in immersive displays of affections in front of people."

[Touko]
"People, but there's no more..."

[Taichi]
"There's still a few."

[Touko]
"Ngggh..."

Appears to be frustrated.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, you are the reversible model of overcompetitive girl, and this is fine."

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"But if you get this sweet, you'll also be far too hackneyed! There's too much dampness! Let's be more consistently unyielding! Select carefully when to show shyness. Someone like that is moe... be that, Kirihara!
//Don't think he means that beta as in betabeta. -GHS

[Touko]
"Huh, huuuh..."

[Taichi]
"You are a woman so like a precious gem."

I say that as I put a hand on her shoulder.

[Touko]
"Eh! (flutter~)"

[Taichi]
"That brilliance surpasses that of a diamond... but alas, a diamond is but carbon, and when thrown in a fire it burns all the way. Goddamn it. The stupidity of storing all the fortune accumulated in a lifetime in something diamond-like I have learned well."
//http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2009-08/burn-diamonds-torch-and-liquid-oxygen Literal swear (again). Also, Part 4, Taichi the Failed Speculator. No, he did not invest in diamonds. -GHS

I pinch a bundle of her hair and put the tip of my nose to it, to enjoy the scent.
//??? -GHS

[Touko]
"???"

[Taichi]
"You have shortcomings and strong points. This is what this one would like to have you understand, oh my fair lady."

[Touko]
"I don't really get it but, I get it, yes."

[Taichi]
"So you got it now?"

[Touko]
"...Taichi, you're embarrassed. Of being all sticky-sticky in front of people that is."

[Taichi]
"Brotheeer?!"

Her understanding shifted so far that even a flat English translation of onii-chan wasn't unlikely to slip my mouth in reply.
//HACK less suspicious Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"You have a cute side don't you."
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

Paf, I'm slapped on the back.
Have I just been thought moe?
This chronically dysmorphophobic Kurosu Taichi here, of all people, thought moe?!
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder "features a suicidal ideation rate of 80 percent". Perhaps coincidental - perhaps. -GHS
Should I let it go, should I?
Never!

[Taichi]
"Hey you, Kirihara!"

Pchuk.
I was pchuk'd.
//I'm discovering lots of stuff is verbs; goggle is very useful. -GHS
It was on the middle of the forehead.
My palpitation circuit shorted.
//should I work in a Tokimeki Memorial reference... -GHS

[Touko]
"...eheheh!"

Cherubic laughing.
Wh-, why you...
Dammit all!
Ain't she so cute!
//HACK out with the doll -GHS

[Touko]
"Kyah?"

I totally hugged her.
//See CCA0008 -GHS
Gah, that was complete defeat.
But I shall never be fooled again!
//No, you don't get the scream here. Instead here's the entire opening synth solo: [4Mb of '♪' snip'd] -GHS

[Touko]
"...purr, purr."

Not the Greatness that is I, not by that onomatopeiaaa!
//See CCA0025B. -GHS

[Touko]
"Puuurr purr."

Imitating a cat, Touko scratches my belly.

[Taichi]
"Fmyeeeew~~~♪"

I melted into her charms.

              its explosive birth.
