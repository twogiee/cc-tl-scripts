[Taichi]
"...mhhh-hm."

The night is for writing this script.
It's progressing in ways unsatisfactory.
Content is predictable.
But, for the time being, I must simply advance it.

[Taichi]
"This thing's lacking on the fun, innit."

Right!
Should I let Senpai look it over?
As the saying goes, the right moment to do things is the moment you think of them.
//Tweaked proverb a bit so it fits circumstances better. Boku everything in adapteeshion-desu -GHS
I left the house straight away.
This is Senpai's house.
//Try to imagine it. Reeeally hard. -GHS
I try to knock, but there is no reply.

[Taichi]
"SENPAAAI!"

As expected, no response.
//There's no one in the house, as her father's been in jail for months now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your Taichi has cooome!"

Loud silence.
She absent, maybe?

[Taichi]
"..."

Are you kidding me, she's still as school?

[Taichi]
"Whoooa, she is!"

[Misato]
"Wah, Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"You're pushing yourself way too far!"

[Misato]
"A-, apologies!"

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

As is her habit, I should say, she seemed to be assembling the antenna.

[Taichi]
"There's no working at all in this pitch black darkness!"
//It should be about 4 PM. -GHS

[Misato]
"It worried me... is that bad?"

[Taichi]
"It's bad."
[Taichi]
"If you have free time to do that, then please check the script."

[Misato]
"My, you managed it already?"
//Literal because hyperformal Misato. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is on the way. But I would still like to hear your opinion."

[Misato]
"Ahhh, but with this darkness... I cannot read this."

[Taichi]
"So you cannot."
//HE can't read in the dark either, what the hell is he thinking? -GHS
[Taichi]
"Well, this is enough already, so let us head home."

[Misato]
"Ah, but... I still want to..."

[Taichi]
"Mimi-senpai..."

[Misato]
"Buuu〜t..."

[Taichi]
"If you rush forwards you will not obtain what you want."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"You would do better to take things slow. Am I wrong?"
[Taichi]
"Because we have sooo much time still."
//They have their whole lives ahead of them; they have infinite time due to the Cross World etc.; who knows how long until the End of All. -GHS
[Taichi]
"If you hurry this... then this is the only thing that will end faster."
[Taichi]
"Senpai, would you even be able to stand that?"

[Misato]
"...!"

A tearful face.
My spinal column goes numb.
And I realize that, accidentally, I let my mouth run to the taboo.

[Misato]
"...I... I am running away, then?"

[Taichi]
"You are."

[Misato]
"Is it... that noticeable?"

[Taichi]
"It is that noticeable."
[Taichi]
"You are running away by sinking into work."

I look up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"By hook or by crook, you find work to do... and in the most time-consuming way, intentionally."

[Misato]
"...did you see through me?"

[Taichi]
"I thought it was normal."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"If Senpai was doing it, it couldn't be that strange."
//Less formal. Continues the "I thought...". Of course Taichi would have a skewed idea of what's normal. -GHS
[Taichi]
"There is no such thing as a human who has never run away!"
[Taichi]
"But to be like you, Senpai, being unable to do anything but run away as if your life depended on it... that is heart-breaking."
[Taichi]
"It can't last, that heart of yours."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"You... must've gone above 30 by now."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Symptoms: intense self-injury."

[Misato]
"......"

A silence called assent.
I merely kept piling word on word.

[Taichi]
"Hard labor on your own is fine. But letting yourself be cornered by it... you keep sinking into this on your own, that's dangerous."
[Taichi]
"...when that explodes, you being here on this rooftop is dangerous."
//The heart. "She does do so" in CCC4021 and CCD0022A. Or it's just this moment becoming Fixed. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Do you understand this?"

[Misato]
"I under... stand."

Fragmentary, to say.
//This refers to that pause, I think. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This is a really big worry for me."

Senpai took off her glasses.
The back of her fingers accompany themselves to her tear-filled eyes.

[Misato]
"I make even you worry, Peke-kun... I am so unstable, that is why."
//See CCA0003. Seems specific enough. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hahah... saying it that way's a bit impolite!"

[Misato]
"Ahahah!"
[Misato]
"But I am surprised at you telling me this."
//Seems Misato either doesn't expect Taichi to do anything but try to have his messy fun, or to ever call on her bullshit. Perhaps Taichi's not the only one here who thinks the counterpart's a moron. -GHS

She wipes her tears.

[Misato]
"...thank you."

[Taichi]
"'s nothing."

[Misato]
"But... we are broken up and scattered around here and there... soon, it will be as if we had all vanished into the fog."
//霧. バラバラ will return... -GHS

[Taichi]
"I will not vanish into the fog!"
//Since she's the #1 source of death in the story for Taichi, that is almost too perfect not to be intended. -GHS

[Misato]
"But you have... less than pure motives, so to say."

Exposed.

[Taichi]
"Well."

[Misato]
"But it is true that I have become obstinate, perhaps."
//Very strong 'fixed thing' implication. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Besides, strictly speaking it seems you were not alone, you know?"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

I show her the parcel that I found earlier at the foot of the water tower.
//So the water tower is NOT above the stairwell? I don't get this. -GHS

[Misato]
"A supply drop?"
//Lots of those around. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yess'uh."
[Taichi]
"However, contents are curry bread."
//"He just stole a crateful from Sakuraba" (fnarr fnarr). This may be his way of being passive-aggressive, but remembering what curry bread means (Christianity), the joke's on him. -GHS

[Misato]
"......ah!"

Realizing, she pins down her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Lately, that guy seemed nervous enough that he would just not show face either, right."
[Taichi]
"That idiot, he has the kind of personality that just cannot stand even looking at close friends being driven into a corner."
[Taichi]
"And he brought you some near-spoiling curry bread."
//For first read it should probably be read as a tone change joke. How can it be near-spoiling? Well, it's at least half a day old. Of course, things will no longer be spoiling when Taichi realizes there are no germs (which is his way of accepting there is fresh stuff being brought in). -GHS

[Misato]
"But you seem happy, Peke-kun."

[Taichi]
"Shall we eat?"

Senpai made a tiny nods.
We ate curry bread, the two of us.
