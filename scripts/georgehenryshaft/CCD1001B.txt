Me too, though.

[Misato]
"...that way of thinking is... something I have a problem with."
//And now Kiri. -GHS
[Misato]
"Wounds are something that remains on the heart, you know?"
//And the hokora. Not much difference. -GHS
[Misato]
"...because I... have done something horrible..."

[Taichi]
"Do you repent of it?"
//The cardinal question of the route. Apologizing to one's father indeed. -GHS

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Supposing you could return to that time... would you be capable of making a more correct choice then?"
//Although it can have value as far as repentance, actually doing so wouldn't change anything: remember the notebooks, or as she mentions it, the wounds on the heart. -GHS

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Therefore, self-reflection is meaningless."
[Taichi]
"It is merely repeating the same thing over and over."
//With this, he's all but rejecting the loop... except he CAN change things here. Or is it all about finding peace? -GHS
[Taichi]
"And that, Senpai, is just what you are doing."
[Taichi]
"...that is something that I can understand."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"So I do not know the circumstances, very well, but..."
[Taichi]
"...the only thing I have seen is you escaping, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"You would be fine without the club. Definitely."
[Taichi]
"Will you just stagnate in there, forever?"
[Taichi]
"You will have opposition to the way I'm saying this, but to accept your sinful self, should you not be necessarily working on some kind of plan of action?"
//As the end of this sequence will be an "I failed", the action he's talking about is still the wrong one. -GHS

[Misato]
"That is... impossible."
[Misato]
"It is absolutely impossible, now."

[Taichi]
"Why!"

[Misato]
"Because... there are no people."
//I'm leaving it lateral, but it can also be read "because the person is not around anymore" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, then what are you going to do?"

[Misato]
"...that... I do not know."
[Misato]
"That is what I would want to ask...!"

Facial expressions vanish, still sunk into deep thought.
She is expressionless like the clear calm surface of a lake,
but the bottom is agonizing worry.

[Taichi]
"You want to have hurt inflicted on you, Senpai."
//She's an M. Like Taichi. -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh..."

[Taichi]
"Your sinful self wants punishment, right?"
//As CCZDXC clarifies, the idea of atonement via sex is very dark nukige. He'd definitely at least think that, given his background. -GHS

[Misato]
"That... is..."
//HACK ooookaaay... -GHS

I reduce our distance by one step.
Proximity.

[Taichi]
"Would you like me to give you that?"

Automatism.
//HACK ooookaaay 2... -GHS

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"With that, maybe things could become a little easier?"
//HACK ooookaaay 3... -GHS

[Misato]
"That is... weird..."

Senpai grows perplexed.
/太一「こっちに来て下さい」

[Taichi]
"Please come here."
//HACK unzooming everything and removing doll -GHS

I take her hands, leading her,
interposing no process to manage refusal.
Senpai did raise a tiny grumble of objection, but she showed no resistance.
//At having sex with a boy she likes? Why should she? This is why it won't work. -GHS
At the House on the Sea, on the veranda, sitting.
//Fun thing to do: google Umi no Ie (in romaji). That's not even remotely on the sea! I won't forgive this!!! -GHS

[Misato]
"...what are you doing...?"

[Taichi]
"To tell it like it is, this is about 'what' you will be doing!"
//"What" is, naturally, an euphemism for sex. GOTCHA! I'm trolling ya; it's an euphemism for genitals. It's in the dictionary and everything. -GHS

I take it out.

[Taichi]
"Please lick it."

[Misato]
"Hy..."

[Taichi]
"Looks different in daylight, right?"

[Misato]
"......lick, you say..."

[Taichi]
"A fellatio."
[Taichi]
"Well, hurry up."

[Misato]
"A man's... licking it... ...and I don't really... know how to do it..."

[Taichi]
"Doing it just like you are sucking on a lollipop should be fine."
[Taichi]
"Well, put it in your mouth."

I push it to her.

[Misato]
"...!"

Occlusion is weak, defense is brittle.
Penetrating.

[Misato]
"Nh... nMwah... nh..."

She closes her eyes when just the tip is in her mouth.
I am driven by an urge that wishes to chase that tongue that has fled to the depth,
but I resist it.
//Because SYMBOLISM!!1!1! ...see CCD0021. Hmmm. -GHS

[Misato]
"Nh, nnh... nnnh... sHour..."

So she says as the orb at the tip is halfway through the return trip.

[Taichi]
"Maybe it's because we went in the sea. Or what could it be?"
//Sometimes I wonder if Tanaka was trolling even would-be translators. Oh well, all together now! In the sea♪/there are wonderful♪/wonderful creatures♪/they are called the s-GHS♪
[Taichi]
"Continue. Lick on thoroughly, until the flavor is gone."
//That final line of the story is getting more and more perverted... -GHS

[Misato]
"...nh... nhRh... hrhrhnh... nh, nh, nnnh..."

Maybe using the term 'lollipop' made her do this:
a motion languid and sluggish, but with appropriate application of tongue.
She smoothly licks upwards.
I'm run through by a huge stimulus, making the blood vessels swell.

[Misato]
"Fwah, do not become this big please..."

[Taichi]
"Impossible!"
[Taichi]
"Well, continue."

I gently push the hips forwards.
Senpai seems confused at her cheeks being pushed from inside.

[Misato]
"Nh, nnnh, nHmh... nh..."

[Taichi]
"How does it feel?"

[Misato]
"aHnh... hah... so big... choking on it... hur, sh..."

[Taichi]
"Therefore, please use tongue too."
//Not supposed to join with the above. -GHS

Speaking in a way that disregards the function of conjunctions, I coerce further servility.
//We're now hit that point of absolute writing desperation that lies beyond boredom. -GHS

[Misato]
"L-, like this? ...nh, hrhuh, hrhOh..."

[Taichi]
"No good, you have to be more enthusiastic."

On explaining the procedure in more concrete ways, Senpai first goes red all the way to the ears, then obeys.

[Misato]
"Nh, nMh... nh, hrHrHh... pchrh... nhRhoh... pch, nh, nnnh."

I stroke her head,
and then pose a cruel question.

[Taichi]
"How do you feel when licking this?"

[Misato]
"Nkh... nMuh, nh, nhNh... nFh, keeps getting hot and more hot... head is getting foggy."

No hesitation in her speech, perhaps because her ability to reason is obtunding.
//This is in her character, see the 'robot' thing in CCD1001. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Please take care to suck as well."
//Yeah, lady, Taichi can't be the only one that sucks. -GHS

[Misato]
"Nh, nnnh, pch, pchRh, pchhhhh..."

Cheeks pucker,
mucous membranes of the mouth clinging to the pole.
//I'm seriously starting to wonder if he's using the word as a running gag by now. -GHS
But she's just sucking now...
I guide her head up to near the point of pulling out,
and then put it inside until she was swallowing it.
Senpai understood immediately.

[Taichi]
"Nh... like that."

[Misato]
"Nh, nmh, pch, hrhuh..."

Once in a while, she also entangles her tongue.

[Taichi]
"Like that, while intermingling every so often... you are very skilled!"

[Misato]
"FwAh, nh, nmh, hrhrh... pchhhhhhh! ah, it got bigger again... amazing, so long..."
[Misato]
"I cannot fit it in my cheeks... nmh... pchrh, pch... haah, haAhah."
//It's more disturbing how she can talk this clearly without chewing. But let's not overthink fetish stereotypes from Japan (please). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, how about using those boobs you have?"

[Misato]
"W-, with my chest?"

[Status]
inability to understand.

[Taichi]
"Put it between them, then lick just the tip."
//~nai nai~ -GHS
[Taichi]
"With that size you got you should be able to do this, right?"

[Misato]
"S-, so embarrassing..."
//I can't believe you're saying such embarrassing things? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Get on it, Mimi-senpai."

And to reinforce I say,

[Taichi]
"Whose breasts are those breasts?"

[Misato]
"Ah, ahh... they are yours, Peke-kun..."
//See CCA0025C -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then they will be used at my discretion."

[Misato]
"But used, really... nh... hrhuh, aHnh, N! ...nnnnh... nnnh..."

I plug her mouth, sealing in any further words.
//yay you go my man that's what women are forrrrrrzzZZZZ -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come on, in between."

[Misato]
"Ah, aaah... hot... l-, like this?"

[Taichi]
"Harder."

[Misato]
"Yes... nh... ah, the tip, it... pch, pch..."

[Taichi]
"Soak it well deep in your drool, make it all wet and slimy please."

[Misato]
"Y-, yes... nh, nhRh... hrhrh... pch, pch... nnnh, nh, fWahnh..."
[Misato]
"NhuRh, nh, nnnnh, nh, pchrh... fWah, haaah, haaah, something bitter... leaking out..."

[Taichi]
"Because you are making me feel nice."
//Unknown what this might beeezzzzzzz -GHS

[Misato]
"...aAah... nmh... pchrh, pch, pch... pcHkh, hrhUhlHuh... pchhhhhhhhhh!"

She's proactive, at least.
Is that how a person that desires punishment behaves?
//Go ask yourself, ya masochist. -GHS
Boiling hot saliva heated in carnality,
enough spilling off to moisten the breasts.
//Interesting that 潤びる seems to mean "grow larger with moisture" as well. I don't think that's the intention on this one, as I think the breast inflation scene was cut. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah... my saliva... on my chest... all sticky now..."

[Taichi]
"Are they your boobs now, Senpai?"

[Misato]
"Th-... they are... yours..."

[Taichi]
"Then please make my boobs much more sticky now."
//...I don't even wanna know what's really happening. I almost hope some sex scenes do happen, because... -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, aaah... nGh〜, nfh, nh... nnnh〜......"

She services me all the more enthusiastically.
The gap between the breast fills with the heat of carnality.

[Taichi]
"You're sweating pretty nicely. Feels nice between the breasts."

[Misato]
"Really... feeling so nice... so embarrassing..."

[Taichi]
"Do it smoothly, all with the cheeks. I like it that way."

[Misato]
"Nh, pchRhRh... pchuuuh, nh, ah, haah, haaah, nMuhmh..."

The instant I said 'like' she went at it with strength,
//See above the faux scene with her stripping. That's why she believes him, at some level. -GHS
in a way not far from the love bite.
//Hot damn the CE box for PS2 Amagami EbiKore+ is literally a store exposition box. That thing's bigger than my monitor! -GHSomehowRelevant

[Taichi]
"Mmmh... men... we feel it in the tip."

[Misato]
"...ah, then... hRhrh... nnnnnnh〜!"

With the tip of the tongue she wrenches open the mushroom,
with a tongue that enters through the open tip.
//Ah, finally some guro. -GHS

[Misato]
"...mh, I will put some of my saliva here too..."

[Taichi]
"I am going to come soon though..."

[Misato]
"Nh, jhUph... nnh... nnnnnh, nh, aHnh, fhUhnh..."
[Misato]
"Hahhh... breasts, amazing... like they are melting."

[Taichi]
"It is all a sticky mess of sweat and saliva there."
//A beautiful reminder of how not a single line of Romeo's writing could be removed without entire scenes collapsing. -GHSarc
[Taichi]
"They are like... genitals."
//Boobs are genitals! DURRRRRRRRRRRRRRR -GHSoundsLessDumbInJapaneseButNotMuch

Senpai's voice shakes as I bring to the forefront the shyness she was about to forget.

[Misato]
"'ly... so mean... nnnh, pchPhuh..."
//"sonna" -GHS
[Misato]
"NhNhNh, nh〜, pch, aHfh... nMh... nnnh, nnnnh!"

But she quickly dives back in,
//没 botsu -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your nipples are getting hard, Senpai!"
//They're HER boobs now? He literally says "Senpai's nipples". -GHS

so I pull her back.

[Misato]
"Y-, yes... the nipples are all stiff..."

[Taichi]
"How did that happen?"

[Misato]
"...that would be... this here..."

[Taichi]
"Paizuri... boobjob. Say it."
//You learned another word in Japanese! Now you're just five synonyms for 'rape' from mastering it! -GHS

[Misato]
"B-, boobjob... it makes me feel good, so... nPch, pcHrh... aHnh... it leaps, up inside the mouth... amazing..."

[Taichi]
"Is that all you are feeling now?"

[Misato]
"And... your... penis, Peke-kun... so hard and hot, so... nh..."

[Taichi]
"Then, please make me come!"

[Misato]
"...ah... with the breasts...?"

[Taichi]
"Stroke it while you suck hard."

[Misato]
"...ah... understood... nh, nnnh... pch, pch, nHnHnHn... pcHhhh..."

Obedient.

[Taichi]
"Yes, I will be coming soon, so keep sucking."
//Even if in this particular scene I surmise the formal talk being part of the Senpai/Kouhai fetishism, I can't help but think that Taichi keeps sounding bored throughout most of these scenes. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, nMh, nMh... aHnh... nh... nh, fWah... nMhuh!"
[Misato]
"Pch, pcHrh... hRhRhuh... nh, ah... NNNNNNNh!"
[Misato]
"fWah, aHnh... nHnHnHnH, nnnh, nnnnh, pch, pchhh... n〜〜〜, nnnnnh〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜!!!"

Rising higher,
I ejaculated.

[Misato]
"NNNNNNh?!"

The fact of having come inside Senpai's mouth makes my dorsal spine shake with a pleasure greater than the corporeal.
Semen passing through the urethra, blowing out in clumps,
in Senpai's mouth... in Senpai's mouth...!
The birthplace of her sweet voice,
is dirtied by my semen.

[Misato]
"...nh... aHfah... ah... nKh... ...nh...AH?"

I pulled out midway through ejaculation.
I want to dirty other places too.
Semen spurts, like gelidium jelly squeezed out of a press, plastering her face and breasts.
//トコロテン also prostate-stimulated male orgasm due to the association pressing->squeezing out. Yay I learned something else that's horrifying! And I am sharing! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hah..."

My beautiful Senpai, so suitably sullied.
My Senpai, stenchful of semen.
//Grrr, stench, why you not a verb... -GHS
...good.
//See CCC0000 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Did you keep the semen inside your mouth?

[Misato]
"Nh... nnnh..."

Nod.

[Taichi]
"Stir it up with the tongue, savor it well."

[Misato]
"......nh... nh... nnnh..."

[Taichi]
"Swallow."

[Misato]
"...nKh... *gulp*..."

Done with swallowing, she lets loose a big sigh.

[Misato]
"Ah... on the breasts too... and so much..."

[Taichi]
"Yep, I have shot out a lot."

It entangles even down to the nipples.

[Taichi]
"Your thoughts on being ejaculated on the face?"
//Dude, I understand it's appropriate given the intercommunication aspect, but an "interview" was WHAT YOU JUST DID. -GHS

[Misato]
"......a-, amazing... smell..."

[Taichi]
"Ah, there's still some left."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

Squeezing the sphincter, the last drops flew out,

[Misato]
"KYAH?"

and stick to Senpai's nose.

[Misato]
"...aw, my face... all dirtied..."
//his dick was the mike -GHSakuraba

//HACK adding this as a better segue because zomgs trainwreck shit etc. etc. let's just get on with this. -GHS
I feel like I want things to stay this way, always.
My negligence in readying photographic equipment was regrettable.

[Taichi]
"...so, wash your face and... to the next part."

[Misato]
"You can... still do more... of this?"
[Misato]
"That time... it was just once..."
//Odd way she has to refer to 'last night'. See CCA0003? But I suppose it properly disconnects, since that sex scene was actually several routes and who knows how many loops ago. See CCD4003. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It was your first, so I was gentle!"
[Taichi]
"But today I will be a bit less reasonable."
[Taichi]
"...after all, you want it like this, right?"

Whispering near her ear.

[Misato]
"Ah... well..."

She splashes water from canteen, washing away the semen.

[Taichi]
"Get up and straddle on me, please."

Slowly, slowly Senpai readjusted herself.
//身を立てた heh he wishes. -GHS
JMP N_SCENE002
:SCENE002
:N_SCENE002
The breathing of both of us stopped at the moment of embrace and penetration.
The slimy noise of insertion,
and, simultaneously, the release of breath.
On the instant of connection, a feeling of subjugation beyond description warms my body.
Having sex with a person I am familiar with,
and especially a close friend, a companion,
is an experience as soothing as a narcotic.
I attain great nourishment by connecting with the amenable people who exist around myself.

[Taichi]
"I am inside."

So I proclaim in a tiny voice, while licking her ear.

[Misato]
"...ah... y-, yes... so far inside... so much..."

[Taichi]
"So much, how much?"

[Misato]
"Hah... it inside the belly, I can... feel its shape..."

[Taichi]
"Wow, that is some great sexual sensitivity! Your body is incredibly sexual, Senpai."

[Misato]
"Wha-...!"

[Taichi]
"If you can feel things so readily, it means you are pretty well developed. In sexual power, that is."

[Misato]
"...I would not know..."

[Taichi]
"You will understand that soon as well."

[Misato]
"Eh... KYAH?!"

Upward thrust.

[Misato]
"Nnnnh, nh, ah... all of a... sudden..."

I cannot move as well as I want to,
so I shake her harshly with the strength of my arms.

[Misato]
"Ah, ah, aUhnh, haah, ah..."
[Misato]
"th-, this... deep... too deep... hurts, it hurts... hAhnh, HYAAAH!"

[Taichi]
"Welll, then let us do this for all of today."

I put my tongue in her ear.

[Misato]
"Haaah... no-, not thaaat... ah, aaah, hYah... aUhnh, aah..."

[Taichi]
"Using your boobs as cushion feels so good!"

On each thrust, her breasts were crushed into the flat of my chest.

[Misato]
"Ah... aUh, oH, nh, aaah, nh, ah, do-, do not shake meee!"

[Taichi]
"If I do not shake you, this is not really pleasurable you know."

[Misato]
"hAah... hah... ah... aah, HY! Hyfhn... if-, if you... keep doing it like this... it-, it hurts..."

Senpai seems in pain, perhaps because it is so snugly inserted as far as it will go.

[Taichi]
"I will try to change how this feels a little."

Twisting Senpai's butt, I rub into the wall on one side.

[Misato]
"NNNNNH! ...hy, hyah, hyaFh... inside the belly... huuurts..."

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

Feels so good.
The feeling of friction is insufficient, so there's no direct stimulus, but,
the weight of Senpai's body lets us cling together,
and her upper body bends over and sticks to me. With her breasts.
It becomes harmonious, and makes the feeling of conquest carry onwards.

[Misato]
"Nh, nnnh, ah, aUhnh, oOoh... hYAH, stop... cannot, hold on... nh... p-, please... really..."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Misato]
"T-, toliet... let me go, please..."

[Taichi]
"Toilet? Need to pee?"

[Misato]
"...y-, yes... because you are all churning me... quickly!"

Maybe her bladder's getting too much stimulation?

[Taichi]
"I understand."

[Misato]
"I-, I am sorry..."

Senpai puts her hands on my shoulders, and tries to lift herself upwards.
She wants out.
She wants escape.
I quickly change my mind.

[Taichi]
"In the end I cannot."

[Misato]
"Eh... KYAH!"

Taking off her hands, Senpai fell,
//#1 -GHS
with a loud watery sound.

[Misato]
"Hyghy, gHyyy... h... ah... nGh..."

Losing her support, she skewers onto me by herself.
Why?, asks the face that looks at me,
eyes thoroughly intimidated by this attack just now.

[Taichi]
"I don't wanna stop here after all, so..."
[Taichi]
"Pee here, please."
//fucking scat nukige -GHS

For an instant, Senpai did not understand.
She stops on the dot.

[Misato]
"Ah, aaaaah... ca-, I cannot! ...that's... I beg you... let me go to..."

Wriggle, kick and struggle.

[Taichi]
"We are at the beach anyway, it is OK, is it not?"

Holding her tight, enjoying the sensation of a rebellious struggle between my arms.

[Misato]
"Here, but that... impossible, cannot!"

[Taichi]
"Well then, if you manage to shake me off, then you can go."

I squeeze her tight.

[Misato]
"But... so mean... I will never be able to..."

[Taichi]
"Well then, will you be letting out here?"

[Misato]
"...ah, aaah..."

Hesitation.

[Misato]
"Nh... nnnh... hah, haaah... take it out... let me go..."

Once again she grows restive. But her strength is weak.
There's no serious intent to push me off, but I can glimpse a design aimed at persuading me in some way or another.
Of course, my mind won't change.

[Taichi]
"...then just five seconds."

I let off strength from the arms.
Senpai moves, timidly, very timidly.
I pull down her hips by grabbing her ass,
//#2 -GHS
deepening our joining.

[Misato]
"NNNNNNH!"

[Taichi]
"Here, gooo on!"

Again I let off strength.

[Misato]
"..."

As she begins to move, I catch and twist a nipple.
//#3. Going singular because it's W-twist below. -GHS
And this we repeat so many times:
//See CCC0033A -GHS
be it by pinching her clitoris, by poking her anus, or by tickling the side ribs,
//#4, #5, #6 -GHS
I surround her with impediments.
//So he can stop her from escaping yay symbolisssmzzz -GHS

[Misato]
"...hAhnh, ah, aaah... ahnh... a-, agaaain! nGhy!"

As she gathers her last strength and tries to raise, I shoot her down with a dual-nipple twist, and Senpai finally collapses exhausted, no more able to move.
//Because Double You is pr0nounced double in korea or whatever asian stuff all the same amiright. More importantly: #7. -GHS
I screw into her hips and give her pleasure.

[Misato]
"Ah... aaah... dooon't, do not spin arooound... pee... gonna come out!"

I will not stop.
I chase her into a corner.
//because of flight...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"One with a body this perverted cannot have leakage accidents!"
//This line reads like it's out of a nukige. It's utterly unsalvageable. Very likely intentional. -GHS

And on saying that, Senpai began sobbing.
And while she was sobbing she lifted her chin, and breathed hard.

[Misato]
"fWaAAAnh, anh, aHnh... can't, ca-... nnh... nnh!"

Her body squirms, desiring extrication.
I grabbed her hips and pulled her back. Complete adhesion.

[Misato]
"Hah, hAAAAAAA!!! Nh... nnh... it's bad... really... enough..."

The flesh quivered.

[Misato]
"...he-, help me... let me go... pee is so nasty..."

[Taichi]
"I told you it is alright!"

But what, exactly, is alright I don't really understand myself.
//ナニ, same term he used for his penis at the start of the scene... -GHS
I merely became enraptured as her body swayed.
Senpai became as foliage being tossed about.
//the trunk is his dick -GHSakuraba

[Misato]
"Really... stop this... it is, unacceptable, nh... nnnh.. aUhnh..."
[Misato]
"Uggh, uWah, nHkh... nh, noh, nooo... hot... letting my guard down... if you keep this up... guard down, and then I will leeeak?!"

[Taichi]
"〜♪"

[Misato]
"Nnnh... nAh, sorry, forgive me, this is seriously bad... nOh, aaah!"
//Ah, and here we get to the annoying acceptation of 'yurusu', which is "forgive me", "allow me", but also "release me" (think "excuse me"). It's absolutely normal for girls in uhmmm certain nukige to ask for their uhmmm completely consensual partner to let them go - which is often erroneously translated literally as "forgive me", especially in uhmmm anime. Here the conflation is made explicit: Misato wants to be forgiven, not so much 'let go'. This religious sense is how the watersports scene below should be read. (And there goes another sentence I never thought I'd type.) -GHS

Response changes.
Limbs cramp, showing strange convulsions.
//Finally her four limbs are becoming mysterious! -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, ahnh, aHnaHnh, nAh, guhhh... nooo, not tiny movements... going numb... ah, ah, oAh, aah... aaaaaah..."

Something of the moan, something of the begging.
The yarn of her coquettish voice continues to be spun, incessantly.
//It's at this point that I wonder if Tanaka actually intended many of these scenes as intellectual porn, not as literal porn. And are therefore likely a subtle (very very subtle) parody... -GHS

[Misato]
"Li-, listen... listen to me! Ah... aah... it... hyFuh!"

[Taichi]
"Senpai."

The knot named Miyasumi Misato comes undone.
A downfall that I spurred onwards.

[Misato]
"hYgh, ah... ahYh, hYah... fWah, HY-! Ah, hyah, ah, aUh!"

Repeated quick, sharp motions,
and then deep pounding.

[Misato]
"Ngh..."

I set up a tempo, so as to make her voice come out at my unrestricted will.
I pushed a finger into the hole in her ass.

[Misato]
"nGHY, ah... aaah. nH〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜!!!?!"

Her vagina squeezes, giving the feeling of being diagonally wrung.
Contractions.
And simultaneously,

[Misato]
Hah, AAAAaaaaaah... AAaaah... aaaaaah... NOOoooooooo..."

Senpai went incontinent.
And together with her clumsy carelessness, a light climaxing.

[Taichi]
"Hahah, lower half's so hot now. Alll wet through!"

[Misato]
"Nooo... nooo..."

[Taichi]
"Do not cry, Senpai!"

I lick off her tears.
Salty.
//YES YES MWAHAHAHAHAHzzz -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because we shall be continuing as is."

[Misato]
"...fWah... eAH?"

Her absent-mindedly peaceful face is so lovely.
Slowly, I restarted the rhythm with the hips.

[Misato]
"A-h! ...nGuh... do not, this..."
[Misato]
"uWaaah, hah, hahnh... do not, no, no... too soon, noooo!"

[Taichi]
"Then I shall be moving slowly."
[Taichi]
"Here, slooowly, slooowly."

[Misato]
"Ngggh... oOh..."

She claws at my back.
I don't mind.

[Misato]
"Hah, hah, hah... nh... aAh... ahnh, nh... aAaah..."

Continuing with slow movements, the faced she showed me seemed to be melting.
//yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah so metal! -GHS

[Misato]
"Ugh, nh, aHnh, aaHn... do nooot... hYuh... like this, likeee..."

[Taichi]
"Do you understand what is being done to you?"

[Misato]
"Aah, hah... inside my belly, all over everywhere, being, rubbed."

[Taichi]
"Yeppy yep."
[Taichi]
"And, I have found your weak point, Senpai!"

I scrape and scratch with my tip, paring down the growth that lies there.
//Seems to bind to that "you're pretty well developed" up there. IOW, it's Mimimi-senpai's peach pink G-spot, see CCA0030. -GHS

[Misato]
"...hYAAAAH!!!"

Breathing stopped.
I continued shaving on the same point.
//Because the tip is a pencil, so, uhm, he's just sharpening his pencil so to speak. Damn that still sounds too sexual. -GHS

[Misato]
"OhOh... oFwah... kYah, nH, n〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜!!!"

Senpai readily climaxed.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah, so cute!"
[Taichi]
"Let's go for multiple in a row."

[Misato]
"nGhyh... oHuh... oh... nnnh... nnh... I-, I am sorry!"

She apologized,
but in regards of what act the apology is for is a mystery.
//obviously for letting Kei-kun become infected with Hinamizawa Syndrome, DUH. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You are not forgiven."
//Gah, now it's a "I won't let you go" + literal for massive subtextzzzzzzz I need more coffee. -GHS

I continue the persecution of the same point.
//Because bible gamez as well as sechszzz -GHS

[Misato]
"I am sorry, I am sorrySorrySorry... aGhuh... I am sorr- ...NNNNH!!!"
//Maybe you should stop stalking people with Hinamizawa syndrome, Hanyuu. YOU ARE NOT HELPING. -GHS

Her legs, entangled in my hips, twist about and thrash.

[Taichi]
"Nooo goood. Here you gooo, one biiig scrape! One-Two-One-Two!"

[Misato]
"...nnnnnnnh!!! Nooo! Forgive, me, eEeeh..."

Multiple orgasms in a row.
...and just before climaxing, I cease my persecution.
//Just because I'm not screaming "SYMBOLISM!!!" at every sentence does not mean I couldn't. -GHS
Teasing is needed in love.

[Misato]
"Ah? ...haah... hah... nGh..."

Her breath goes rough as she continues to cling.
I kiss her face and kiss her neck, but there is no response.

[Taichi]
"How is it?"

[Misato]
"Ahnh, nh, nh, nhh... aAahh... cannot... understand anything anymore..."

[Taichi]
"Senpai..."
[Taichi]
"You can feel more of this, it is fine!"

I scrub on her weak point again.

[Misato]
"UWAAA〜H! No way... I... made to... feel amazin... gh... NNNNNNNNNNNH?!"

And I, as well, am coming closer and closer to the finish.
Gradually, the quantity of heat in the hips began to grow tortuously.

[Misato]
"nGhy, ah, hy-, hYAAH!" ...fWaaah, ah, aUgh, ahnh, ahnhanh... hAAhnh!!!"
[Misato]
"Nooo, so amazing, amazing, hYah, ah, amazing... ky-, kyghuh〜〜〜〜〜〜!!!"
[Misato]
"Nnnh, aHnh, do not do not, you cannot, do not..."

Disordered exhalations.
There's a bodily reaction as well, as the limbs one by one fall out of sync.

[Misato]
"...ah... ...bad..."
[Misato]
"Nh... ah... bad, do not... somehow... reaching..."

[Taichi]
"Say 'I'm coming'."

I bring my lips next to her ears, and ordered this.

[Misato]
"I-, I'm coming, I am coming!, I'm... coming... co... kyAaah!"

Grinding on the inside with all my strength,
and only on that weak spot.

[Misato]
"Nnno, dooon't!!! Ah, I'm-, I'm COMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNG!!!!"
//ーx16 1+6=5? no 3? uhmmm I forgot math -GHS

Sexual feelings jump within my arms.
Hugging close, relishing every part of the body.
And somewhat behind her, I also climaxed.
Senpai's voice grew huskier and vanished, as the spurting of semen continued.
$SNCCD1001_2 = 1
IF $KAISOU == 0 JMP N_SCENE102
:N_SCENE102
............

[Misato]
"...and with this... will I be forgiven?"
//You just had a boy you like make you cum like sixteen times, do you think? -GHS

So said Senpai, fixing back the buttons of her blouse.
She is horribly depressed.
The cause is... not the teasing, I expect.
It's just that she knows.
Accepting an unsuitable punishment is not the resolution of a sin.
No, from the very start this---
//"We have to be continually reminded of what we believe. Neither this belief nor any other will automatically remain alive in the mind." -CS Lewis -GHS

[Misato]
"Will I... with this... be forgiven...?"

[Taichi]
"No sin can ever be tolerated."
//This continues the acceptation screw(?) of 'yurusu' seen in the sex scene: he does mean this as "you cannot be forgiven", in this particular scene, but as is usual it also hides the truth: it can also be read as the above, which continues the Christian concept of sin as intolerable, but forgivable - but not through mere punishment, certainly not inappropriate one like this. (Un)fortunately English has got to be more explicit. -GHS

I kick sand while gazing, lost, at the sea.
The sand fluttered in a fan shape, becoming translucent.
//Same term as Misato's hairstyle, see CCB0005 -GHS

[Misato]
"Then... whatever I do, I never will..."

A melancholic voice is squeezed between her non-short silences.

[Taichi]
"..."

If I were just a little less objectionable a human, I would have been capable of cheering her up.
Formulating an argument devoid of honesty that would contrast her self-contemplation.
//He's saying if he were a BETTER human he could LIE to her. He's never more clearly delusional about what he is than in Sendback. -GHS
But I can't do it.
Whatever you do, indeed.
//Reprisal of Misato's words. -GHS
That is the certain truth, and because I so believed,
the silence conveyed the intention.

[Misato]
"...uuh... nggggh..."
//うx7 -GHS

There were no means to console her.
I got carried away by the moment a little too much.
I ended up bullying Senpai.
Even though, in a Happy Ending,
there would certainly be a beautiful Trauma Counseling here.
//Translation: your typical VN would tie up personal problems with a bit of crying and "let's just do our best". Not happening here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...so difficult."
//HACK earlier music stop -GHS

I covered my face.
I realized that I had failed.
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS

[Misato]
"There are always informal names between close friends."
//The dating of this scene is difficult. It seems newer than the beach scene, CCA0027, yet newer than the Mikiri introduction, CCC3004. I suspect there's an error somewhere, and I'm not excluding in the Beach scene. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

[Misato]
"Let us decide nicknames for each other!"

There was this feeling that the nuance was closer to "pet's name", too.
I am like a pet to her, no mistake.
Regardless,
since I didn't understand whether or not there was actual affection under her smile,
I was still vigilant.

[Taichi]
"Then... Senpai."

The result of my considerations allowed me to suggest that appellation.
///sarc -GHS

[Misato]
"With just Senpai there is no actual telling me apart, is there?"
//Well, does he know other Senpai? Outside of Youko, that is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...that is just irrational. Is Miyasumi-senpai not good enough?"

[Misato]
"Hmmm, Kurosu Taichi... let me see."

She didn't listen.

[Misato]
"Taichi-kun is just boring, yes it is."

[Taichi]
"Boring, really now... that's somebody's name, dammit..."

Just casually sharp-tongued.

[Misato]
"...Kurosu... Cross... cross mark... demerit mark, Batten!"

[Taichi]
"...I would like to veto that, if I please could."

I bowed my head.

[Misato]
"Awww!"

[Taichi]
"I would apologetically decline being called in a way that sounds so dialectal."
//Curiously, the PS2 version tones this down to a "is that not dialect?". Damn, even this stuff... -GHS

[Misato]
"Then... cross mark... in Kanto that is Peke..."
//She replaces something that sounds dialectal (but as far as I can google isn't) with *actual* dialect. -GHS
[Misato]
"...Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"You have brewed up another thing that sounds moronic."

[Misato]
"Ah, but it feels right. I am very pleased with it!"

With 'peke'?
Seems "X" was at the base of her thinking.

[Taichi]
"Thinking about it... does Peke not just evoke worthlessness?"
//See next line -GHS

[Misato]
"And it could also mean X as in 'combining'."
//Read 交わり majiwari. -GHS
[Misato]
"The notation of 'peke', X, means crossing."
//Oh, symbolism. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...without so much as reciprocal support, like that thing they say about the Person kanji. It's just piercing through."
//HACK minor addition at the end, lololol because sex scenes. It's very possible to understand all this without messing with the person kanji, but it's a nice (if trite) cultural detail to know. Compare 人 to X. -GHS

Shake-shake, I shake my head.
//Just kanji vs. katakana tho. -GHS
Ain't that just crossing but never meeting.
//These two lines are also new (or technically so). -GHS
That was so dreary.

[Taichi]
"But what I get is nothing but the meaning of paths that cross but never meet..."
//Symbolism. -GHS

[Misato]
"It also contains the desire that even us, rejected by the world, have of someday finding our crossing with someone."

[Taichi]
"...hypocritical."
//Because Crossing should be Meeting for him. -GHS

And furthermore, forced.

[Misato]
"So, I have decided on my side. It is your turn now."

Decided she has, dammit.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

With things ending up like this, I had nothing to do but keep her company.
//See CCC3025. He kept company at the tea parties, too. And he didn't protest when they gave him the nickname 'ichiko', didn't he. Hypocrite. -GHS
I haven't been around her but for a short time, and yet this I knew well.

[Taichi]
"Then... she-slave."
//PS2: "love doll". Possibly even more appropriate. -GHS

[Misato]
"There is no slavery within the Constitutional State of Japan."
//See CCC4015 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Love Slave."
//PS2: "Passion Doll". -GHS

[Misato]
"How is that even different!"

[Taichi]
"Senior Sow?"
//Pseudospanish reading. PS2: "Class Rep" -GHS

[Misato]
"...you want to become the Kouhai of a female pig, are you fine with that?"
//PS2: "I get called that a lot, but I don't like it." -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oppai-san."
//Fetishistic term. PS2: "Chest Measurement". -GHS

[Misato]
"Th-, that kind of eyes on my chest..."
//His EYES on. Always interesting. PS2: "Let's stop with that approach", then jumps to the 'boobs' line below with "Can we distance ourselves from the eccentric?". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Cowmilking evalS."
//隷奴 instead of 奴隷. -GHS

[Misato]
"I do not understand the point of saying that backwards..."
//Seems to be no different than norP. Certainly doesn't seem to be used by anything else but porn. http://vndb.org/v/all?sq=%E9%9A%B7%E5%A5%B4 some examples. -GHS
[Misato]
"Shall we distance ourselves from 'boobs'?"
//See CCA0030 -GHS

So many requests.

[Taichi]
"...eromegane-san."
//STILL specific fetishistic term. In fact, between this, oppai and Reido, I think it's all but conclusive that he's been spending waaaaay too much time in the last year or so playing eroge. Dark ones. -GHS

[Misato]
"Denied."

[Taichi]
"You are just denying all of them!"

I shout.
I can't manage this by staying my cool self.

[Misato]
"Because you are making nothing but weird suggestions!"

[Taichi]
"Then, Eyeglassed Female!"
//See CCD1001. Hypocrite much? -GHS

[Misato]
"That is just what I look like. Is there no twist?"
//Admittedly, few could get away with what amounts to writing down their thoughts process as they figure out what two characters should call each other without ending up like the good ol' trope of getting around a writer's block by talking about it. -GHS

A line far too perfect for a female who about to give someone the name "demerit mark".

[Taichi]
"...Mimi."

[Misato]
"Because?"

[Taichi]
"MiyasuMI MIsato, Mimi."

[Misato]
"Ahhh, that seems nice!"

She softly breaks into a smile.
She's as lax in the way she smiles as she looks slow in the head,
but.
...there is an odd self-conscious embarrassment.
//Given CCE0001, that'd be in both. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But there are three of them. Mimimi, then."
[Taichi]
"Should be written 'beauty, kanji repetition, beauty' I think? Although it is usually pronounced Bibibi or Vivivi."
//...though for all of this, it may just mean something like 'pig-headed shitface' in some obscure local dialect only spoken by indigenous people whose existence the Japanese government formally denies. -GHS

[Misato]
"That sounds like it belongs to some dumb heroine..."
//If it's a reference, except that one above, I have no idea. -GHS

Well, she was the kind of dumb person who would call out to a dangerous character like myself.
//Think about it: it's the call of the devil... -GHS
Excessively dumb... so much that against my better judgment, I ended up wanting to be kind.

[Taichi]
"...Mimi-senpai."

[Misato]
"Ah, yes yes, that is good yes!"

[Taichi]
"So it is."

[Misato]
"And so with this the two of us are Senpai and Kouhai!"

She put out her pinky.
This is wrong, I thought, but still responded. We linked pinkys.

[Taichi]
"And by the way, you worked me like a mule to find you a intimate nickname. How is that different from actual slavery?"

[Misato]
"It is the coerced labor of love."
//AKA Love Slavery. This recalls what he said at the start, meaning that Misato understood him perfectly; whether he just trolled him hard or she's just that innocent-minded in her recognizing things, however, is not so simple to tell. This ambiguity reflects on Yusa, who may well be understanding Taichi just as well, and therefore continue to recolor that scene in CCD0021 as her being rejected by him and not viceversa. -GHS
[Misato]
"Ah, of course I mean the love of friends, right?"

[Taichi]
"Whatever you please."

I shrugged my shoulders.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
HACK different transition back, zoom -GHS
Evening.
There Senpai was, after having expectedly took off on her own.
Youko-chan was nowhere around.
As Mimi-senpai has returned she likely left, having been relieved of duty.
//Or she was never there at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"..."

Gazes intersect,
but they never join together.
//SYMB(snip) -GHS
Their axles overlap for no more than one mere moment.
I stand still, Senpai slowly and sluggishly moves.
Two people are here, wordlessly.
It seems I'm still not able to tear Senpai off of the antenna.
//Sorta funny still given CCC4025. And CCD0022A shows that Misato, on the other hand, had no difficulties doing so. -GHS
But treading inside the heart is what I absolutely must do.
...but doing that on my own is... terrifying.
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
It's Saturday.
...one more day.
There is one more day.
//HACK Zoom. Oddly, PS2 version uses the incomplete antenna for this, but that's obviously wrong. 360 repeats the error, as it often does. -GHS
I came as early as I could.
From the looks of it, work was nearly finished.
Employing Youko-chan was a good deal.
//Except it was all done last night, wasn't it. -GHS
Next there's only the waiting.
Saturday.
That guy will come around, with a high probability.
//He's not waiting for him to come to wreck the antenna, but to see how's things and maybe help him, see CCA0029. -GHS
And yet.

[Taichi]
"...he ain't coming then."

However long I wait, that door doesn't open.
Eventually noon went by, and Senpai came in.

[Misato]
"Ah... Peke... kun..."

[Taichi]
"Mimi-senpai..."

[Misato]
"...ah, uhm, truth is..."

[Taichi]
"Y-, yes?"

[Misato]
"Ah... no... it is... nothing at all."

[Taichi]
"Ah, wait!"

I extended a hand. And then let it descend back, powerless.
She was gone.
Well, work's 'bout complete, so it's fine after all.

[Taichi]
"...have I just failed then."

Stalemate.
Rather, I could take her compulsorily to the hokora---

[Taichi]
"Not happening."

There's nothing reciprocally obtained in that.
Me being satisfied alone is unacceptable, and progress in ways that are satisfying for Senpai alone is also unacceptable.
It might be just hubris, but,
there absolutely must be exchange.
If there is even only the feeling of a reciprocal touch of hearts, that will be it.
That said, what to do to bring this to a smooth conclusion?
I haven't a clue.
//HACK zoom -GHS
I waited for so long.
Neither Senpai nor Tomoki show up.

[Taichi]
"..."

In these hours passed in waste,
I think.
Tomoki not coming at that point means him not being in the mind to help.
//See above, he didn't replicate CCA0029. -GHS
Which means---
There are strange sounds.
Intermittent ones.
...sounds that make me uneasy.
The sounds of destruction.

[Taichi]
"?!"

I spring up.
//HACK no zoom, but wrong BG there. -GHS
I came out of the prefab.
Tomoki was there,

[Tomoki]
"..."

with large industrial-use pliers.
The kind that could snap a bicycle's chain in half.
//The ones that'll end up in CCX0001, prolly. -GHS
The antenna was being wrecked,

[Taichi]
"......"

with special attention to the wiring and the machinery.
//The stuff she has particular difficulty with. -GHS
Thoroughly and completely.
This is not the kind of tear-down made by someone who's passively given in to anger,
it was a precise killing of functionality via rational thought and appropriate tools.
//Reminds of someone? More interesting is how he seems to have done this before, many many times. -GHS
Destruction with composure.
//See CCA0003. Hmmm. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

He's not aware of my presence.
The zeal of the assembly of a scale model makes one's vigilance towards the surroundings grow lax.
//Reference to how he's totally dedicated to this; however, this sounds oddly like a completely off-place reference to Sakakibara-sensei, who's known to build scale models (though of girls). -GHS
I approached without words, and punched him.
//HACK shake screen before doll -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...?!"

When his eyes recognize me, the astonishment disappears instantly.
The Tomoki I see is abnormal.
//The one that's in CCB0022, the liar who claims he doesn't see Taichi as a friend at all. Looks like Taichi's far from the only one growing something bad inside... except his CC is 17%. Great job, government. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

He returns my blow, without words himself.
A fight with composure... or more like grappling.
Five minutes later,
the victor was I.
//See CCD0002. Taichi's not holding back here, but Tomoki isn't a complete pushover anymore. Kiri wasn't the only one to train, although in this case, it's possible Tomoki did so well before the start of the loop, while it's less plausible with her. Or maybe, Taichi's just lost a lot of sharpness, which would be thematically appropriate, and fit with CCC3012A. -GHS
With a bomb in his tendon, Tomoki could never win from the very start.
//See above: "I was aware that I was holding a bomb within". An abnormal Tomoki destroying his sister's work with calm insanity, an odd connection between him and Sakakibara, and there's a bomb in the place where Misato really really hurt him. Lack of forgiveness once again rears its ugly head in all. This further confirms that, at least right now, Tomoki's no External Damage at all. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Haah, haah, haah..."

Sitting astride on Tomoki, seemingly resigned and nonresistant, I begin talking.

[Taichi]
"Yusa-chan, remember her?"

[Tomoki]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Yusa-chan, my neighbor. Got all attached to me. She came to the beach too?

[Tomoki]
"Aaah... that girl..."

[Taichi]
"Whenever I was in direct contact with that girl, I always dressed up myself."

[Tomoki]
"?"

[Taichi]
"I only showed her my nice side, and acted, and was all pleasant and agreeable."
[Taichi]
"And as a result, Yusa-chan grew all attached to me. And I really liked her too."
//But there's no exchange of hearts there. More likely that she understood, although she was perhaps too young to quite understand, like Misato in the flashback above. And as Taichi is still now. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...what does... that..."

[Taichi]
"Ain't that betrayal?"

[Tomoki]
"...?!"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

The act of knowing your real self, and attempting to conceal it.
//The irony is in how THIS is his concealment. -GHS
The act of willful deception.
An opposition to the universal good conduct of showing one's honest self,
and therefore an absolute must not.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"And in the end, I was discovered."
[Taichi]
"I ended up hated by that girl."

My experiment concluded with bitter severance.

[Taichi]
"Nothing that I could do about it, tho. I did swindle 'er."
//See CCA0027. Touko's a half-decent judge of character... emphasis on the half. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...and betrayal's something you detest, right?"
[Taichi]
"You're the type to never forgive betrayals, right?"

[Tomoki]
"...but, Aneki, she..."

So he says as if gasping for air.
No more words follow.
He looks back at me, seeming still restless.

[Taichi]
"I betrayed Yusa-chan. And then we broke apart."
[Taichi]
"But the reason that girl hated me was not because I was hiding ugliness."
[Taichi]
"It's just that that ugliness was rejected by her very biology."
//...except, as seen in CCA0013, said biology sees straight through him, and creates an incredibly improbable connection. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And I wanna know, is what you're not forgiving actually betrayal?"

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"What you two are doing looks like the spitting image of each other."
[Taichi]
"You make up some club and lose yourselves in there."
[Taichi]
"There's no people anymore, you get that?"
[Taichi]
"The world of the heart and of the mind is no more, you get that?"

It had became rarefied.
//Which could still only mean that the two don't really have friends. After all, there's few Experts in Gunjou. And Tomoki's siscon, well. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And what that means, what that is... don't you get it, Tomoki?"
[Taichi]
"It's not human to only ever do what's correct."
[Taichi]
"You can accept that, you can refuse that. That's all."
[Taichi]
"But if you accept that, then don't you stick a reason to those feelings!"
[Taichi]
"So that you won't end up sticking a lie to your feelings of love..."
//HACK early stop music, zoom -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...but I wanted to tell her that..."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Tomoki]
"To tell Aneki that it's not human to only ever do what's correct!"

[Taichi]
"...tell me what happened, I don't even know."

[Tomoki]
"Aneki sold out our family!"
[Tomoki]
"Our father! To the police!"

[Taichi]
"...police?"

[Tomoki]
"Aneki, after the divorce, went together with father."
[Tomoki]
"I went with mother."
[Tomoki]
"Even dad told us to do that."
[Tomoki]
"...dad... he was in a mess!"
[Tomoki]
"He had alimony to mother, he had tuition..."
//Isn't Misato forced to go to Gunjou? What do they do with people who can't pay tuition, just chop 'em up in the Research Building? And what about Tomoki's? Fascinatingly dystopic if so, but I suspect this one's a plot hole. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"There was no other way!"

I instinctively understood.

[Taichi]
"...what kind of crime was it? Money motivated?"

[Tomoki]
"It wasn't about money! Just what was needed... to live..."
[Tomoki]
"But Aneki couldn't let that go."
[Tomoki]
"Aneki reported it!"

Senpai did that.
Discipline,
rules,
are reciprocal interchanges between people.

[Tomoki]
"...it's family, but Aneki... she sold off even that..."
[Tomoki]
"Really that girl... she just wants to push her own sense of values on other people..."
//See CCB0005 -GHS
[Tomoki]
"And if they don't just accept it, she quickly gets weird."
[Tomoki]
"She tries to injure you on purpose... she follows you around..."
//The latter's possibly what made her approach Taichi. That is the entirety of the background we get on the subject, though given the context that is all that is needed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Injury you say, is that her self-mutilation syndrome?"

[Tomoki]
"That is Aneki's attack!"
//Self-wounding as attacking is a surprisingly rare (correct) conclusion to draw. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"By attacking herself she attacks people!"
[Tomoki]
"This club here's like that, she secludes herself in solitude, acts all disagreeable, and immersing herself in it... that's an attack against all of us!"
//Remember how she refuses help from anyone. -GHS

[Correspondence]


club = attack.
Ahhh, so that's what they mean.

[Tomoki]
"She'll soon... go weird... she'll get herself injured!"
[Tomoki]
"She'll get herself injured on purpose."
//The first reading is that Tomoki believes the type of incidents in CCA0016 are done on purpose. -GHS

A dark fire in Tomoki's eyes.
The bonfire of hostility.
Tomoki is laughing.
Hating someone is so pleasant to the heart.
//See Yutaka now. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"She'll behave in ways that make it easy for her to get injured."
[Tomoki]
"...why do you think I can't play basketball anymore?"

[Taichi]
"What'cha mean?"

[Tomoki]
"I protected Aneki. And those are the aftereffects!"
//Misato didn't hurt him; he hurt himself trying to save her. If Taichi was just a bit off in CCA0016 and the tools fell on him... -GHS

He spat that out, viciously.

[Tomoki]
"...and what Aneki values... is the rules, ya know that right?"
[Tomoki]
"Really that girl... she only wants to make others accept her... she just wants to live up in a cozy place she does..."

[Taichi]
"Do you seriously hate her?"

[Tomoki]
"...I really hate her."
//And here's the big lie. See CCB0022 vs. CCA0029, or how he brings her food in CCA0028, or how he hangs around the infirmary, or how he stalks her (above). This is no more hatred than Kiri's is for Taichi. -GHS

[Misato]
"Tomoki..."

Behind me stood Senpai.
//Deus Ex Machina. Though the ex machina part's suspect. -GHS
Tomoki realized that as well.
The words don't stop.
He's of the mind to vent it all to the end.

[Tomoki]
"...however close you get, there's no point, Taichi."
[Tomoki]
"Deviate from Aneki's rules on the spur of some moment, and it's all over."
[Tomoki]
"...Aneki doesn't need bonds or anything of the sort!"
//Now compare Taichi and Youko. Not quite. -GHS

[Misato]
"Tomoki... I..."

[Tomoki]
"There's no more people, so there's no rules she should be holding on to, not anymore, not anywhere!"
//But see CCC3012B. Is that really true? -GHS
[Tomoki]
"That's why... really, if she keeps this up, Aneki will just tear herself apart."

The world is a patchwork of hearts,
rules are its wreckage.
//See CCA0030. -GHS

[Misato]
"...say now... Tomoki... I, well..."

A tearful voice goes through me. It's headed towards Tomoki.
//HACK more serious Tomoki -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You shut up!"

Tomoki shouts in my direction.
I was a convenient wall.

[Tomoki]
"Nee-san, you're a traitor!"
[Tomoki]
"Father protected you, you know?"
[Tomoki]
"When mother wanted to toss you away, he protected you, didn't he!"
//HACK doll -GHS
[Tomoki]
"And you betrayed that father... for what? I don't get it at all... I don't get the point of that."

He's crying.
Look at you!
You love your Aneki from the bottom of your heart, don't you?
And yet your crying face isn't something Senpai can see.
//HACK dollwork was changed around here, I guess. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"And now, father will be made to make amends, and for a long time..."
//He's speaking like he's still around. Of course, not suspicious given he'd totally still 'feel' that way... -GHS
[Tomoki]
"If you value yourself as that much important..."
//See Miki, but the error is the same as Taichi and Youko. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"It'd just be better if you lived alone!"

[Taichi]
"..."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

Those last words left me a deep impression.
That's true indeed.
The heart's an egotist after all.
And ego is the power to paint out the boundary lines of the heart.
//That returning term. -GHS
Hexagons in number beyond count blanket the world. Each and every one of those is a heart.
//See CCC0025. Sakuraba knew. This also ties the hexagons to the snot bridge, furthering the idea that what Yusa wanted to instinctively create was a connection. -GHS
They absolutely must be of the same size.
They absolutely must be of the same shape.
//On this, understanding of the vain Japanese anti-individual cultural ideal of beating down the nail that sticks out - and the similar metaphor of squaring the round pegs to fit in square holes rather than viceversa - seems useful. -GHS
If they are not so... they will be made to bear the external pressure themselves.
Normally, that is intolerable.
The moment it becomes tolerable,
it becomes a monster that day and night lusts insatiably for the hurt and the destruction of all that surrounds it until nothing is left.
//Emphasis appears to be on wanting to do, not necessarily the doing. This, after all, is a description of mankind whole. -GHS
All while shrinking the area of whomever is next to them.
//HACK back to normal, different doll -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah... Tomoki... that is why..."

Trying to smile with gentleness, she half-smiles.
//See above, but more importantly, Taichi vs. Kiri. This isn't gonna be the first time, and Tomoki's gotta take this as condescension. -GHS

[Misato]
"I..."

A half-smile.
//HACK More evidence the dollwork was far from complete here. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah...!"

Trying hard beyond reason, her limps cramps up.
//HACK later doll removal -GHS
My consciousness being brought back and the sound of Senpai springing into a run were simultaneous.
//Odd term. Was he just 'manifesting' her...? -GHS
She ran away.
I rise,
//He's still sitting on Tomoki. -GHS
and extend a hand to Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"In short, Senpai sold your father to the authorities, right?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, that's it."
[Tomoki]
"Twice now she's led us to downfall."
//Since every Tanaka character is Secretly Ultra Smart (and that's kinda annoying once in a while), it's not too out of character for him to use that word. -GHS

His tone of voice is level.
His manner of condemnation is through an indifferent behavior.
//He condemns THROUGH indifference, it's not just a pretense (though it is, too). It's ultimately a fake, however, as seen with Taichi at the end of Downfall/Purification, and mentioned above. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"First time... were my injuries. Because of them, mother... went bad."

Perhaps, being of the same gender, she could only see her daughter as self-centered.
//Hum, reverse-Oedipus sounds like a more likely the cause than Chick Fight - though reverse Oedipus is obviously not what Tanaka meant with this sentence. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Father protected her to the last."
[Tomoki]
"And that's why we were split in two."

He leaves an empty space of several seconds.

[Tomoki]
"And that was still lucky. Mother had become neurotic, so..."
//Their mother also snapped. -GHS

Being apart was for the best.

[Tomoki]
"But... that person, even to her father..."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... right, of course."

[Tomoki]
"Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"I get Senpai's feelings, and well."
//HACK this doll -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...eh."

[Taichi]
"You're pretty healthy and sound so... I don't expect you to understand, but..."
//That sounds so funny after reading all the above, I hope. -GHS
[Taichi]
"This got nothing to do with will."
[Taichi]
"Us guys are... automatic."
//Oh, look, it reloads the same doll without the change above. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Automatic... you said... but what does that..."
//Well, some can drive automatic transmission, some can learn (damn quickly!) to use manual, like Tomoki and Yutaka, and some, like Taichi, just can't seem to drive at all without wrecking the car... though they can use the bike well, so that's no problem. -GHS

[Taichi]
"When that kind of circumstances come by, the response can't be but that."
//TL NOTE: Japanese is vague. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Always, without fail."
[Taichi]
"All the love there is, all the bonds there are, all irrelevant."
[Taichi]
"The exact dead center of the brain makes it so."
//I'm supposing he means that this is something that comes from the very core of being human, not from the mesencephalon. Not that he has any idea of any of this stuff, so he's talking out of his ass anyway. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Rationality can't control it."
[Taichi]
"That's why... it's possible that even if you love... you will end up breaking."
//See CCD0016A. "Love, therefore desire to break". -GHS

Rather, in proportion to the interest given,
there is a want to touch with fingertips that have turned blades.
//See CCD0022A as redone. Wonder if this was intended to be an Edward Scissorhands reference. Some of the basic ideas of both that and Cross Channel are very similar. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And mostly, we hate that part of ourselves."
//Human -> automatism -> self-hatred. This is almost certainly what Taichi is, too. -GHS

Tomoki was speechless. For just one minute.

[Tomoki]
"......you too... Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"Really you, what kind of person do you think I am?"
[Taichi]
"Some guy whose academic grades are over 80% or something?"
//See CCA0022. See CCA0029: whoops. -GHS

A tiny smile.
//HACK more creeped out Tomoki -GHS

[Tomoki]
"But you're totally alright, Taichi, ain'tcha... you're making things go well for yourself, ain'tcha...?"
//See CCD0022A again, though this was in the original too. It's just way more obvious in the rebuilt version. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Acting."
[Taichi]
"All of it, acting."
//Youko's acting skills are allegedly exceptional, but Taichi's, ehhh... -GHS
[Taichi]
"I really liked Yusa-chan, myself."
[Taichi]
"But... me, that girl, that girl that was always bullied... even knowing all that... I once pushed her down."
//It fits the evidence so far perfectly that Yusa acted all nice and perfect to him while still being bullied, IOW that she lied to him about being all fine, exactly like he (claims he) did. In CCA0013 and CCA0020 the subtle wrongness in her behavior is all there, and her mother's favoritism and loudness are obvious causes for bullying. But this line doesn't put the final word on that, unfortunately, as CCA0013 also says she used to be bullied, with the hint that wasn't so at Gunjou. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"!"

[Taichi]
"Rationally I understand. It's something that ought not be done. But I couldn't endure."
//See CCD0021. Taichi's lying to himself, as he always does. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I really, truly, cannot control it."
[Taichi]
"Don't you forget, Tomoki."
[Taichi]
"Anybody who's in Gunjou, whoever it is, they hurt someone while being hurt themselves."
//This includes Tomoki; therefore the implication is that Tomoki forgot that he, too, is hurting someone and is no mere victim. Whether Taichi is aware of what he's saying, however... interesting comparison to what he does to Miki at the end of her route, too. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"............"

The space between us is cut across by the wind.
It's the dry parched air that runs through the wilderness.
It makes the skin feel unpleasantly cold.
Tomoki, as I see him, appears frozen.

[Taichi]
"If you really hate Senpai then there's no ways, but..."
//See CCX0001 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Maybe that father could... forgive Mimi-senpai you know."
//HACK react damn you -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...!"

[Taichi]
"But respect's the long and short of it... if you can't do it then there's no ways, right?"
//Still CCX0001 -GHS
[Taichi]
"Human relationships get weird if you mix in your personal interests."
[Taichi]
"Just, as long as there's some affection it's OK. Am I wrong?"
[Taichi]
"...it's fine if it's a one-way flow. Seems like your father's doing just that."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I..."

[Taichi]
"Take your time to think about this."
[Taichi]
"The answer's inside you, nowhere else."
[Taichi]
"If you get an answer... tomorrow morning come up to the mountain shrine!"

[Tomoki]
"Shrine...?"

[Taichi]
"'Round noon. Me and Senpai have plans to be there."
[Taichi]
"Also, me and Senpai had sex."
//HACK this looks so weird in the PS2 version, where the line about sex was just cut. -GHS

Tomoki stood in mute amazement.

[Taichi]
"..."

I waited like that for a minute, but there was no hint that he would go to hit me.
With shaking lips he whispers something,
which I could read as "well then".
I could nearly not hear it.
//See CCA0006, CCD0002 - does he? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...if you have anything you want to say, tomorrow at noon, come to the shrine."

There is no response.
I chased after Senpai, Leaving behind Tomoki with complexity on his face.
Where could she have gone that's not the rooftop?
This is the first time there's been this pattern.
...I have to persuade.
Even if it ends up that I have to show her my wound---
//This BG is the front of the school, except someone forgot to enable the layer with the actual (open) gate, so all that's left of it are the wheels. This has never been corrected in any edition, not even the Reprint. Nice QA there. Unfortunately, it's beyond my ability to repair. -GHS
Senpai's house had been closed down.
//Well, not unthinkable given she's been living alone for at least four months. But Touko's house, that one's still a mystery. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hellooo, anybody?"

The door was locked.
I could unlock it. But...
I make my senses keen.
Inside this empty shell of a house, I seemed to be able feel the hint of Senpai's tiny presence.
//That conditional may well make it all in his mind, but when he called she might've just moved, maybe even talked; he just heard her, no matter how barely consciously. Seen it (done it) myself; this ain't necessarily ESP. And it's inconsistent with his Eyes. -GHS
I become aware that the amount of heat coiling in the abdomen,
will burst open and become completely incontrollable.
I waver.
I think.
In the end, I return home.
The hours of the night are the hours of moping.
My wounded flesh I heal by submerging in the darkness.
//This reads so much like "I'm chuunin' and I know it" with the above. He's more likely just tired, though he rightfully fears his frustrations with her will make him overdo it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Peaceful, innit..."

I called out from the window to the outside.
//See CCA0024. -GHS
Suppose I failed in capturing Senpai.
...I will redo it again from the start.
I will increase the chances of a reciprocal touch.
I was well aware of that weakness.
I slap my cheeks.

[Taichi]
"Get psyched."
//Screw it, it's another random but timeline-appropriate reference. -GHS

Rapidly now,
before the memories I end up creating become lethal.
//No memories > too many bad memories. Time is of the essence still. This should be what the weakness above refers to. -GHS
I lay in the bed, slowly making my mind calmer and composed.
To calm my heart so highly strung by the fistfight,
//There it is: not by her flight, just by having to beat up his friend. -GHS
to cool down my rationality of low capacity.
//Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Good!"

I was serene after spending the night.

[Taichi]
"Let's go then."
//HACK Nope. -GHS

I come here to have a look, just in case.
...seems like she hasn't come.
Still secluded at home then.
In front of Senpai's house.
//Hum, hers isn't on this hilly road... ah well. -GHS
The garden is somewhat weedy and unkempt.
//And he didn't notice last night? With his night vision and everything...? -GHS
A single week wouldn't make it like this.
After her father became absent, Senpai didn't exercise proper management.
//So her father's a convicted tax evader, and the school allows her to live by herself, just like Taichi de-facto does. Also, if Tomoki wasn't talking bull, who's paying her tuition? -GHS
But why?
Because it hurt.
I go around to the rear entrance.
This here is also locked, but it was an old type of disk cylinder lock.
//PS2 version completely removes any reference to picking the lock. The door is just carelessly left unlocked. -GHS
I insert the tool in the keyhole and make the internal tumblers move.
//...I'm not sure that's how a snapgun works, but there's no certainty it's the same as that, see CCC0011C. -GHS
Shortly afterwards, a 'click' of a sound.

[Taichi]
"I'll be intruuu-ding!"

As I had no intention of surprising her, I loudly proclaimed my trespassing.
//See CCA0010, Youko, Kiri sendback... -GHS
Taking off my shoes, I went inside.
It didn't look like there were bedrooms on the first floor.
//Unlike Taichi's house, see CCC3012B. -GHS
Second floor.
There are only two bedrooms.
One of them was vacant,
hollow bookshelves and an empty bed, nothing else.
Therefore...
//HACK earlier CG, music "Crystal Clear" -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I have come."

I called out to her.
The place had changed, but the actions were the same.
I coil about Senpai, follow her about.
That is all I want to do.

[Misato]
"...what is your business."

There was a reply.

[Taichi]
"I want to talk."

[Misato]
"I would like you to leave."

[Taichi]
"C'mon, c'mooon."

[Misato]
"...Kurosu-kun."

Surname.

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

[Misato]
"Club is all done now."
//See CCA0011A; it's the other half of what she means with this. She doesn't want people to follow her in her flight. After all, it ends with a jump from the rooftop, whether real or imagined/replayed/feared by Taichi. -GHS
[Misato]
"Please go live the way you want."

So she says with faint indifference.

[Taichi]
"...I am living the way I want!"
//See CCA0006 still. -GHS
[Taichi]
"To the extent I can, at least."
[Taichi]
"I like talking to you, Senpai!"
[Taichi]
"Therefore, can I? For just a short while?"

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I heard it the thing between you and your father, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"How should I say this... well, typically it would be thought of something appalling."
[Taichi]
"Tomoki seems to think that as well."
[Taichi]
"Now, if this is off the mark, I apologize."
//Talking about the following reasoning -GHS
[Taichi]
"...but Senpai, you really and truly love your father, do you not?"

The hint of a breath being held,

[Misato]
"...how come... you think that?"

and then response.
A dialogue begins to come into existence.
//See CCA0011C. Has the jab come back? -GHS

[Taichi]
"You are a person of rules, Senpai, that is why."
//See CC3004 -GHS
[Taichi]
"You demand model behavior, especially from those close to you, and from anyone else that comes into your concern."
[Taichi]
"You called out to me because of that, right?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And should that anyone else deviate from the rules..."
[Taichi]
"You persecute them. Because it is just like us to do so."

[Misato]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Maybe it resembles that state of mind of liking, and therefore wanting to tease."
//Which is his, see CCD0016A -GHS
[Taichi]
"Humans, essentially, think in terms of interests me, does not interest me."
[Taichi]
"And the rest is never more than attaching a reason after the fact."
//So where does the interest come from? God? The Source? I don't disagree with the principle that humans are mere rationalizers, but like many of the Big Discourses Taichi makes, this is rather weak as well as only somewhat justifiable with him being the usual idiot. -GHS

[Misato]
"...I do not get it."

[Taichi]
"To like and to want to be involved with are different things, right?"
//See Taichi vs. Youko -GHS
[Taichi]
"If there was no interest, then there should have been no contact at all."
[Taichi]
"Normally, if you come to like someone, then there would be keeping company at a pertinent distance."
[Taichi]
"But us, we are juuust a smidgen broken."
[Taichi]
"...therefore we think, no I don't want to do it, but still we end up hurting and still we end up breaking."
[Taichi]
"That's not a repudiation of the feelings of fondness or love that we have."
[Taichi]
"Rather, we have those feelings and so... we want them to see us."
[Taichi]
"You wanted to be hurt, Senpai, by your father."
//Still lacks motive. What caused her to want to be hurt? Perhaps it's off the scope, perhaps it's only ever intended to be metaphorical. And perhaps Tanaka himself doesn't quite get this part. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Therefore you did something for him to hurt you."
[Taichi]
"And that was the communication between you and your father, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"What do you think of this reasoning here?"

[Misato]
"...off the mark, all of it."
//I don't entirely disagree. -GHS
[Misato]
"I would recommend closing down your detective agency."
//See CCD1001, who's the culprit now? -GHS

[Taichi]
"All lies."
//Yay, Misato vs. Touko! -GHS
[Taichi]
"Why do you hold on to your cell phone?"

[Misato]
"...a mannerism."

[Taichi]
"You are just waiting for contact, right?"
[Taichi]
"From your father."

[Misato]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"Let us say a call comes, what will you talk about?"
[Taichi]
"...how bad embezzlement is, maybe?"

[Misato]
"You are mistaken!"

I know that.

[Misato]
"I... I will just...!"

[Taichi]
"Just what?"

[Misato]
"I want to apologize... I only want to apologize..."

[Taichi]
"As in saying you are sorry?"

[Misato]
"As in saying I am sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Crime is wrong, very wrong. You did the right thing, Senpai. But you want to apologize?"
//The right thing according to the rules of the world. But is it the Right Thing according to higher rules? This is the source of social criticism, and it's morality vs. legality. This is gonna have to touch religion no matter how much you slice it - where do rules higher than that of the social construct that are laws come from? -GHS

[Misato]
"...but... but, but...!"
[Misato]
"I wish I had not known... if I had not noticed... then we would have been always happy...!"
//And she does this intentionally, although whether she is aware that she understands is far more difficult to tell. Then again, Taichi technically understands all his own issues, but isn't aware of any of that all the way to the end. But this still isn't the whole story; what she wants to do isn't simply pretending not to see, it's seeing, accepting, and forgiving. -GHS
[Misato]
"Yes, I loved them! My father who protected me, and my mother, and Tomoki... everybody...!"
[Misato]
"...but now, apologizing is impossible."
[Misato]
"He vanished... with things still being as they are...!"
//This still works if he just "vanished" from Kamisaka into the prison. -GHS
[Misato]
"I did not want to do anything. I did not want to think about anything. Because it was all hopeless."
//For example... what about BEFORE humanity vanished? It's been technically a few months at the absolute very least. -GHS
[Misato]
"But now... I am at the limit."
[Misato]
"I want to die... right now, I really... want to destroy myself... but..."
[Misato]
"Death... is scary..."
[Misato]
"I do not want to die alone..."
[Misato]
"That is why... somehow..."
[Misato]
"I feel sick... being alive... it is making me go crazy!"

[Taichi]
"...how about I give you some comfort?"

[Misato]
"Eh...?'

[Taichi]
"I will give you some comfort, Senpai."

[Misato]
"...what... do you mean...?"

[Taichi]
"I also have something equivalent to what these rules are for you, Senpai."
//That has nothing to do with killing her, however. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Seems you haven't really noticed it, one way or another."

[Misato]
"...Peke-kun... you... people..."
//Can't specify, since the answer is closer to "disrespect" or "mistrust" than what he thinks ("kill") -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

An innocent impulse, just like a cat playing around.
//But Taichi's a dog... isn't he? -GHS

[Misato]
"...will you... me...?"

[Taichi]
"Gently, yes."
//Technically, being sent to the real world - which is heaven in the metaphor - is still death. No one's lying here. -GHS

Bewilderment segregated by the door.
//SIMbowlyzm. -GHS
Not even the body temperature comes through it, yet I could feel it.
//Synesthesia, at this point. IOW, declared hallucinations. -GHS

[Misato]
"...really?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Misato]
"...then if that is really true..."
[Misato]
"I am... enough..."
[Misato]
"That is enough, yes..."
//HACK earlier end music -GHS

Silently the door opens.
The two of us had no words on the way,
because there is no necessity of conversation.
//This part, common for all Sendback routes, is the most rapture-ish of all. The characters are following Taichi on the path to what boils down to enlightenment, with Taichi all but a messianic figure leading people to a better world, after having made them understand part of their error. The other side won't be easy or without the need for work, but it will be so much better than this side. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This way."

[Misato]
"Yes..."

Occasionally I call her like that, to ascertain she's there.
Senpai came with in silence.
I look at the watch,
we're perfectly on time.
//If he wakes at 7 as usual, getting to her house and the conversation above should make it about 9-10, then this should be 10-11. -GHS
Arrival. The Cross Point has continued to exist there, unchanged.
//Today at 0820 hours, the Marathon came under surprise attack from unknown hostile forces. The Marathon has sustained serious damage. -GHS
Resembling a blanket of fog.
//Kiri route... Cross Point... fog... hmmm. -GHS

[Taichi]
"By the way---"

I talk about unrelated things.
Small talk that I began suddenly.
Senpai stared in wonderment a bit, vaguely inserting the feedback noises of understanding expected in Japanese.
//Rumors say most readers won't know Japanese, so specifying again. -GHS
Nothing but waiting for the arrival of that red scarlet.
And we spend several more minutes like that, in vacuous pointless dialogue.

[Taichi]
"Lookie here... it is about time we begin."
[Taichi]
"This way pleeease!"
//That's sooo Misato -GHS

Taking her soft hands, I lead her.
Her fingertips are freezing cold.
Is it fear?
I make her stand suitably near the location.

[Taichi]
"Stand here, please."
//Don't miss the hokora being open. -GHS

[Misato]
"Uhm..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Misato]
"Saying what I am about to say... might just be something I ought not say, maybe, but..."
[Misato]
"This is scary..."
//Most are scared of living. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes it is, yes it is."

More words than those Senpai cannot articulate.
She's in a chaotic disorder because of this abnormal situation.

[Taichi]
"Have heart, because you are now going to need to live in the world of people."

[Misato]
"...of people?"
[Misato]
"But people... are now..."

[Taichi]
"Shhh."

I held down her mouth.
Someone is coming here.
Grass being parted, feet striking the ground.
...running.
He, who could never run, is yet running.
//Maybe his pain was just psychological, like with Sakuraba and Yutaka; but his wound doesn't have the overt evidence of others. It's far more likely this is a straightforwards bona fide miracle. -GHS
No time to talk at leisure, then.
I stare one last time, lost, scrutinizing Senpai in detail.
To stencil her inside my memories.
//Which is funny because she's a drawing. Probably not intended to be this meta, but... -GHS
The world began being dismantled.
//Don't miss the Energy inside the hokora. It's never mentioned anywhere. CG fail? -GHS
The density of the atmosphere begins to deteriorate, the sky grows darker.

[Misato]
"...evening?"
//18:07 -GHS

I step back.

[Taichi]
"Senpai, for having invited me to club, I thank you."

A twitch, and she went rigid.
//PI-KUN HAS HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR GIBBER-GABBER -GHS

[Taichi]
"Even if that was just you imposing your sense of values... I was happy."
[Taichi]
"For having displayed interest in me, I thank you."
[Taichi]
"I will not forget you, not my whole life. Not you, not your words, not the memories with you.

[Misato]
"...please... do not make it hurt."

Shoulders shaking. Voice shaking.
I want to hold her so tight.
I turned back, increasing my distance with Senpai.

[Misato]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Sorry... when I said I would give you comfort, I was lying."
[Taichi]
"Your life will be one of hardships, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"But I will not be there with you..."

A tiny wave with the hand right in front of the shoulder.
//Similar to what she does. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bai bai Senpai, it was fun!"
//Engrish ~reprise~ -GHS

The instant Senpai tried to say something, I closed my eyes.
//Oddly, the open hokora with Energy inside is here, too. BG fail, too? -GHS
And when I opened them, she was there no longer.
I felt fatigued throughout.
My chest felt as if hollowed.

[Taichi]
"Hurts..."

Still tears did not come out.
This feels... like it's halfway done.
I will end up disgusted with myself.
And that is when Tomoki came.
/■友貴　真剣な表情
//"Tomoki serious face" These parts were so obviously rushed they didn't even remove the old doll descriptions. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Aneki... where's she?"

Without warning,
in a hurry,
dripping wet with sweat, having come at a run.
//No sign whatsoever that he's in pain. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Over there, she's over there."

/■友貴　真剣な表情
//HACK removed, it just reloads the same doll that's already loaded! Same message, as well. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...what're you two doing together?"

[Taichi]
"We were picking edible wild plants."
//Could he be more silly? -GHS

/■友貴　通常
//"Tomoki normal" -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...you just took her outside, right."
//Seems to be a really bad straight-man, given she was holed up at home. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I did, hurry now."
[Taichi]
"She's gotten in trouble, go and save her!"
//Another transparent lie. -GHS

His face changed color.
//That's all that he needs to hear to rush at her side. -GHS
/■友貴　真剣な表情
//"Tomoki serious face" -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Where?"

[Taichi]
"There, over there!"

/■友貴　驚き
//"Tomoki surprised" -GHS

[Tomoki]
"But she's not here...?"

Coordinates overlapped.

[Taichi]
"Please tell Yusa-chan that I'm sorry!"

[Tomoki]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Gudnaito, Shisucon!"
//Engrish is also English for certain definitions of 'l' and 'r'. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...do strive to be Immoral!"
//HACK different out (understandably, with white now for flashbacks). -GHS

Tomoki is repatriated.
//Short route... technically. -GHS

[Misato]
"...eh... Peke-kun?"
[Misato]
"......"
[Misato]
"Hello?"

[Tomoki]
"Nee-san..."

[Misato]
"Tomoki? Why are you here..."
//Because Taichi just pointed him to where she is, duh. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Let's... talk."
[Tomoki]
"Because there's something that I want to talk about..."

[Misato]
"Tomoki... you."

[Tomoki]
"Wh-, what?"
[Tomoki]
"The radio..."

[Misato]
"It's... receiving... radio waves?"
[Misato]
"Ah..."

[Tomoki]
"Is that your cellphone, Nee-san?"

[Misato]
"...ringing... a call is coming..."

[Tomoki]
"Who from?"

[Misato]
"...father... it is his number..."
//...they let him have his cellphone in jail? Possibly he was released. Another miracle, in a sense. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"But that's...?"

[Misato]
"I don't understand, but..."
[Misato]
"It's as if... we had been having a long dream---"
//See CCC3007. But that was the END of mankind, was it...? -GHS
[Misato]
"...hello?"
//Disconnected. -GHS
HACK oddly enough it's night now. Not that it changes much if there's no loop and it's just night anyway. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hahahah."

Task accomplished.
Senpai and Tomoki are no longer among us.
There will never be another meeting with them.
Heartrending.
Even only to remember.
Indescribably so.
//http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1342764898 Hmmm, another Showa era expression? -GHS
I leaned onto the hokora and closed my eyes.
//HACK and out -GHS
I am engulfed by a strange vertigo, difficult to describe.
The world felt like it was slowly swaying from one side to the other, semicircular canals causing illusions.
//Oh, right, the semicircular canals cause illusions... totally not like his eyes, right? -GHS
And all along I did nothing but continue thinking about those two.
Consciousness grows dim,
the body suspends primary functions.
The process of complete dismantlement and reconstruction is something that cannot be observed by the powers of perception of a mere person.
//Especially since the space around the hokora should not be disintegrating, so this is actually complete nonsense besides being a lame justification for why the process isn't really described. However, it becomes a lot less lame if Taichi is doing nothing but going to bed and sleeping: indeed sleep is sorta tough to observe by the person himself. -GHS
The world can be dismantled so easily...
When it will end I can never know.
And this is the place in which I go to live.
The struggle continues.
//HACK no need, NVL mode -GHS
               See you next week---
