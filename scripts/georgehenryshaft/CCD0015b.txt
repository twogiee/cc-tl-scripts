[Taichi]
"I capitulate."

[Kiri]
"Please do not move. I will shoot... wait, eh?"

[Taichi]
"I surrender."

I put my hands on the wall and spread my legs before I was told to put my hands on the wall and spread my legs.

The posture of surrender.

[Miki]
"Weeeak..."
//See CCD0006, heh. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...what do we do, Miki?"

[Miki]
"Uhmmm... what do we do you ask... but he's so pitiful!"

[Kiri]
"This guy here isn't pitiful, not at all."

[Miki]
"But Kiri-chin, arming yourself when he didn't is just going too far! Pointing that at people isn't nice..."
//As with CCC3010, Miki may be lying, though it doesn't seem so; it does really seem that it was Kiri that moved towards this secession business first. Of course, Miki could've been pushing her against Taichi even earlier since she was growing in her role as the Villain in the Settei. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...but."

[Miki]
"Let's stop, OK?"

[Kiri]
"...I get it."

Albeit grudgingly and reluctantly.

[Taichi]
"Can I lower my hands?"

[Kiri]
"...go on."

[Taichi]
"Wheeew, you saved me, Miki."

[Miki]
"Ah, it's nothing."

Nyce gal she.
//Yntentyonal. -GHS
So then, shouldn't I just do a deliciously ambiguous "That" to one of these two.
//Sometimes you just gotta tell Japanese what to do with itself. -GHS
