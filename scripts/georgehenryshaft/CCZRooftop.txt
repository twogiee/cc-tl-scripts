The rooftop is swept by the wind.
//This scene wasn't reinserted or reused in any version, and therefore doesn't have associated voices. The fanmade reimplementation was sort of heavy-handed with its effects at times, so I edited it even heavily in parts. In particular, I removed the voices as they sound off when the rest is silent, and added graphics from the original text version. Still, credit to whoever did it! -GHS
It's strong. It's a wind with pressure.
Yet the firm fence for suicide prevention, and prevention of falls as well, does not so much as quiver in it.
//Not even that one part...? -GHS
It's a view through a mesh pattern.
From far away, in this canvas of navy blue with nary a speck of a cloud, ridges depict captivating curves.
Kurosu Taichi was standing, still, pinned down in awe by the sight.
//Wonder if his mountain pass gaze is just a gaze from here. -GHS
He's a boy with white hair,
but it's not because he dyes it.
His brawny build looks strangely slender.
More than slimmed, his body looks like it has been sharpened, made keen.
Just like he was one, living, dagger---
//† -GHS
Before long, his ears catch the sound of the iron door opening behind his back.
//This is well before the Antenna. How fortunate, then! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yoh."

He called out.
It was Tomoki and Sakuraba,
Taichi's partners in crime.
//Same term as in CCZAS, though it's never used in the main VN. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Got them, the 'goods'?"
//The implication is that he went to eg Tasaki to procure them. But since this is supposed to be class hours, where exactly did he find it? Well, maybe he just brought them from home. Maybe, even, from the same place Misato gets 'em. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"It's in here."

Sakuraba came forwards,
voice firm and resolute.
Even from the outwards he was the most grown-up of the three.
//*=Curry--- Tanakan for Christianity. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"They're in this very precious place."
//Very ambiguouhis balls. -GHS

The intrepid boy intrepidly thrust a hand in his intrepid nethers.
//But does he do so intrepi-- yeah, actually, he does. But his hand isn't intrepid, isn't it! -GHS
Taichi and Tomoki's faces froze.
//Tomoki wasn't with him during procurement, then? -GHS
Sakuraba's hand gropes around the genitals.

[Sakuraba]
"Ngh... right, got it."

But what,
is the question that the two bystanders possess a will to ask.
Eventually, the hand returns back.

[Sakuraba]
"There, it's out."

But what?!,
is the question that the two bystanders once more possess a will to ask.
What came out was a bottle of sake.
//One, because what Sakuraba's whipped out of his pants' gotta be pretty big that the rest can share of its precious liquid contents. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Daiginjo, 'Battle Mania'. How's that."
//Says "daiginjo" (high-quality sake) plus "pretty girl". The two together lead to Battle Mania 2: Daiginjou, with no other leads. Game seems to be pretty famous, though. Doesn't google to the sake with the final 'u', but both terms together lead to BM2, so adapted to this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Die."

[Tomoki]
"Die."

Voices overlapped, and kicks also overlapped.
Sakuraba squatted with a lowering groan.

[Tomoki]
"Ahhh, ahhh..."

Tomoki fearfully recovers the item, using his hands as if forced to touch something filthy.
Sterilization is needed.
Taichi heaved a sigh.
The three sit in a circle in a spot nearby.
//These were made as official illustrations for the short story in the magazine this was published in, and still exist in a (not exactly super-high-res) wallpaper that's still around the 'net. Cut 'em and slapped them in. Curiously, there's evidence this specific one actually used to be a CG that was merely cut along with the scene: when Tomoki comes up in the ending (even this new one), the right part of the rough sketch of this is in the background. -GHS
It's a drinking bout,
a prearranged merrymaking with alcohol after leaving classes too early.
//No bizarrely giant bandit bosses around though, see CCA0022. -GHS
"Big boob after big boob, nipple after nipple, and I---"
//These are untagged in the original, as all are, and some of the tags are obviously wrong. I suspect they're fragments, so leaving this as untagged. This may be Taichi or Sakuraba. -GHS
"That swimsuit, damn, that surface area's so small and---"
//This may be Tomoki or Sakuraba. -GHS
"These days when you go to buy some Buruma mail order off the 'net, and gotta pay over 10.000 yen---"
//This is obviously Taichi, see CCC3012B, I doubt Tomoki can afford them or Sakuraba would care for the price. -GHS
This is how a drinking bout among men will be.
The alcohol flows on.

[Taichi]
"You remember that day of the Vow, right, Tomoki, Sakuraba?"
//See CCD0001 -GHS

Taichi raised his eyes to this sky, awash as it was in the fluttering wind.
A refreshing blue.

[Tomoki]
"Yeah... it was a day like this, wasn't it."

[Sakuraba]
"Forgetting'd be preposterous."

The three smiled gently.
Right. That is a precious memory.
As if to replicate that very time, three hands overlapped.

[Trio]
"Although we have been born on a different day, we merely wish to graduate (from virginity and school) on the same day and the same time."

They called it The Oath of the Peach Garden,
because of the special high-class public bath-house called PeachLand.
//This explains an odd line in CCD0001. Wonder if this used to be that scene before it was cut down and/or maybe expanded to contain the rest. -GHS
It was so stupid it could just sparkle.

[Tomoki]
"Me, I've already picked who with."

[Taichi]
"Who?"

[Tomoki]
"Yumiko-chan."

A famous Soapland "employee"
//As with "massage parlor", that's not scare quotes, it's actually part of the name. May be a manga/anime reference, but there's too little to go on. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, ahhh!, you can't! Yumiko-chan is who I nominate, yes!"

Taichi wildly flaps his hands around.
//Regression to child. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Me... maybe Yumiko-chan."

[Tomoki]
"This's a conflict here!"
//This sounds more Tomoki-sh to me. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You go pick a different girl!"
//clone stamps hiragana away -> pencil -> "Ayaka-chan" -> zooms out -> CTRL+Z many times -> google "handwritten font" -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I like 'em neat and clean. You and Taichi... you're always going on about big boobs here and big boobs there, so you should go pick Ayaka-chan, Sakuraba."
//He likes 'em neat and clean, like his sister... and he's in denial about boobs. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"No good. Big boobs bother me."

[Tomoki]
"Why even?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because when I see a chest swaying tempestuously, all of a sudden my awareness vanishes."
//See Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're susceptible to Mammarian Hypnotism, definitely."
//That's one rape nukige subgenre I didn't find... -GHS

So appropriately said Taichi, making up a Special Situational Use Only Neologism as he often does.

[Tomoki]
"...you two are way too dumb."

It's often a necessity for Tomoki to take the Straight-Man role.

[Taichi]
"Whatever, me's with Yumiko-chan, yes and yes!"
//Sooo girly. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I am!"

[Sakuraba]
"No, I am."

The three entered into an unsightly dispute.
//Crap, no CG for this... -GHS
It all came to nothing.

[Touko]
"The three stooges... you'd be hiding alcohol, no less, right?"

A cold voice descended from above.

[Taichi]
"Ngh, Harakiri Touko!"

[Touko]
"KIRI-HARA Touko! Did you end up with brain cancer now?"
//It's not funny in that it may well be true. Something's on the side of his head, definitely. Hum, it's consistent with CCA0002, however, maybe it's not Taichi making it up and she's just that ignorant. -GHS

The long-haired girl, so like a beautiful princess, had short temper.

[Taichi]
"Why would we be hiding alcohol?"
//This line was missing in the transcript (and the Amaterasu version). -GHS

[Touko]
"Ngh... you smell of it..."

Touko averted her face from the trio.

[Touko]
"That there is bad. When your precious Miyasumi-senpai comes in, Taichi, she'll totally decide to hate you."
//She originally says "Kurosu". But this is necessarily after CCC3004, where she refers to him as Taichi, so changed it. Supposing old revision. Touko wouldn't know Misato's a drunkard, of course - not that it'd stop her from doing this, as she's through her Manipulative Bitch period. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whattettynh?!"
//Ick. -GHS

Taichi panics, and screws the bottle of alcohol into Tomoki's groin.
//Well, it's more like "thrust", but let's face it, that's not much better. -GHS
Grind!
Tomoki "G'fhou?!"

[Taichi]
"Please endure, I beg you!"

[Tomoki]
"......"

Tomoki did not speak.

[Touko]
"Indecorous..."

Directly looking at this was difficult for Touko, the august youth.

[Misato]
"My, everyone has gathered here already?"
//This must be after classes now, therefore. -GHS

Three girls.
//This looks like it would've gone beyond the top, but the wallpaper cuts there. There's far bigger illustrations in the Materials Book, but they're obviously preliminary, and the color of Misato's hair is too different to be used there. -GHS
Their vanguard was the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club President herself, Miyasumi Misato.
She is fairly gentle, however, she is a person of rules,
and a person of glasses, as well.

[Taichi]
"Ah, Mimi-senpai..."

Miyasu『Mi Mi』sato.

[Misato]
"Eh... is that not smell of alcohol?"
//This should be suspicious: how does gentle Misato who can't tell dirty jokes (that she'll let Taichi know) know that smell? -GHS

Taichi sweats cold,
and Tomoki also sweats with a blue face...
...but that's a different species of sweat.
//It's Pokinhisballs Sweat. -GHS

[Taichi]
"THIS BE NAUGHT BUT THE SMELL OF OUR SWEAT."
//Spoken robotically. -GHS

Taichi goes for the forceful hoax.

[Misato]
"So it is then... you ought be properly taking baths, yes."
//This would probably have served as coverup for Taichi being smelly, though there's no instances of that joke in Week 1. -GHS

She was also a natural airhead.
//False... -GHS
She has loads of Character Attributes.
//...but this was troll anyway. Yes, she does; everyone here does. -GHS
While we're on the subject, it can be said that she also had the Beautiful Big Boobs Character Attribute, which Taichi found unbearable in many and varied ways.
//See? This should be first person. -GHS

[Misato]
"More importantly, I have a twin of amazing announceme〜nts!"

She stretches out a twin of a chest with an 'ahem'.
//It actually says "taburu" instead of "daburu" even in the original, assuming typo. -GHS
Her blouse stretches out with a 'tug'.
The men cannot avert their sights,

[Tomoki]
"............"

except for Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"What are the announcements?"

So Taichi asked to her beautiful boobs.

[Misato]
"First, the news that these two... Sakura Kiri-san and Yamanobe Miki-san are now with due form joining the Broadcast Club."

[Miki]
"Hellooo, in the end I shall tree everything to you."
//"Entrust my straw sandals to you", though the typical one is "entrust my Geta to you", meaning "I leave everything to you". Meaning should be the same, but given below, it's now a Back to the Future reference because Lybians sell you weapons-grade plutonium, your argument is invalid. -GHS

Miki, with her cute-ish Sauvage Hair, gave a sharp and cheerful bob of the head.
//It doesn't quite google, but with the dolls it's pretty obvious anyway what's meant. -GHS
She was a girl to whom a bitter smile seemed to suit best.
//...? Early characterization, maybe. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed. I shall be warming up what you tree here to my heart's content, Miki-kun."

[Miki]
"I formally adjure you to do so."

[Taichi]
"...it shall be with the most Hot of all Men's Positions, yep."

[Miki]
"Wh-? Where would that be?"

[Taichi]
"Whaaat, it's the Magma Spot that readily stands via naught but blood centralization, of course!"
//Adapted this a little bit to work with 'tree'. It didn't take much. In fact, it's far worse now. Thank you, no need to unpraise me. -GHS

[Miki]
"Sigh."

[Taichi]
"Well, let's get along then. You too, Kiri-chin."

He also makes pleasantries to the short-haired girl always find at Miki's side.

[Kiri]
"...sigh."

Men are not really Kiri's forte.
To her dispirited answer, however, Taichi gave a broad grin with no reprimand.
//Interesting how he's not being an ass to her now... maybe too many people to do so? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, what was the other announcement?"

[Misato]
"Yes, it has been decided that a municipal CF will be established, and its antenna will be set up here on the rooftop. Did you know?"
//That last one is just off-character. -GHS

Taichi and Sakuraba gave a glorious nod.
CF is short for Community FM.
It's a local, community-based radio broadcast.

[Misato]
"And so, I have decided that our Broadcast Club will be taking care of producing a radio program... you see, are there not some bad rumors going around Gunjou? And so, if it can relax people's opinion of it even just a little..."
//This sounds so little like Misato. This sort-of contradicts CCC0022, where the people of the city seem intent on doing this, rather than Gunjou with the administration to assuage the populace. -GHS

Misato speaks,
adorably mixing in flapping gesticulation.
//See CCC3004, however, as well as CCC0015B. Those are seemingly the last leftovers of this part of her character. -GHS
With those motions her beautiful boobs swayed and drooped and came close and grew distant and warped and twisted her flesh around in painful ways and leaped about with the innocence of a little girl and became like a lady's and became like a harlot's.
//Somewhere in Japan, Team Ninja is smiling. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Zzz... zzz..."

Sakuraba was sleeping.
//Impotence more than hypnotism here. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"........................"

Bubbles came from the edge of Tomoki's lips.
//See CCA0027. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Softy softy~."
//"Fuyafuya" is an actual adjective, on the dictionary and all. Japanese is creepy, hold me. -GHS

From the edge of Taichi's lips came drool.

[Touko]
"You monkey in heat!"
//This had Zubaaan, but since this is "W1"-ish, that seems off. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Goh-?!"

Touko punched Taichi,
with the exact knuckletip of a fist.
//See CCA0009B. So that's where Miki copied it from... -GHS

[Misato]
"...so in short, this is a Going Suzui! of a Project and..."
//See CCA0003. -GHS
[Misato]
"...wait, what happened? Kirihara-san?"

[Touko]
"Nothing!"

Touko curtly turned her face away.
Socializing with others is a weak spot for her.
And while thinking this awkward manner of Touko's as charming inside his mind, Taichi lost consciousness.
And then he was awake.
//This part is incomprehensible on its face: no way Misato and the rest would let him lay on the ground for who knows how long. The above was a flashback, and this is reality. The question now becomes whether CCA0030 was the same or simply a recycled troll. -GHS
Kurosu Taichi was alone.
//Leaving the antenna here, see above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nnnngh."

He stretched,
dusted himself off, and headed back home.
