Hours flowed by in dull tedium.
I have been spending the remaining time in reading.
I realized that things that I could not understand before I could now manage to read.
//This has nothing to do with magical knowledge, and everything with emotional maturity. This is possible where he fixes the errors he kept making e.g. in CCA0015C, and finally reading for its own goal rather than cutting corners to chase a possibly literal phantom. aslo he's totally zomfgsxcvoewf reading teh byble's -GHSpellingIsForWinnerZ
From here onwards I will be wasting a lot of time, and all I will obtain will be tiny little things.
//Getting ready to follow a religious calling, which is comparable to eremitism and priesthood due to his mental difficulties with accepting the existence of the outside. -GHS
This is just an increase in its price, an increase of a mere single week.
//Matthew 5:25-26. Works even better considering the Youko Sendback. -GHS
I flip back and forth through the pages.
//I'm sure using the same term as for the loop is in no way SYMBOLISM. -GHS
A mere expenditure of time while inputting character strings into the brain.
/『攻略』は失敗だ。
The Capture, the route, has failed.
//Obvious comment. -GHS
Ergo, it is necessary to do all over again.
The specifications of our convenient reset put it outside of choice at the weekend.
And these days themselves will also become a lesson, a preparation for life in the Eden that will one day come.
//I suspect Tanaka has a very specific conception of what awaits in Heaven. If so, I agree with him. It's probably part of the reason why Cross Channel's meaning is so obvious to me. -GHS
It is indispensable to grow into the habit, however bad, of living while expending time.
//HACK to sky -GHS
Casually, I look out of the window.
Even in this world where not even the cicadas cry somewhere, someone, must be among us.
//Renewing the idea that his messages also don't literally cross the barrier between worlds. -GHS
That is something I cannot sense, yet, this is the truth:
somewhere, someone, must be there.
That is happiness,
so excessively wholesome in its warmth the what is inside the chest tightened, only just a little.
And then---
//HACK end music -GHS
$B = 1
IF $SB_FALSE < 19 JMP L_INC
JMP L_DODGE
//HACK I've tweaked it. Watch out now. -GHS
:L_INC
$SB_FALSE + 1
:L_DODGE
IF $SB_FALSE > 17 $B = 2
