I throw myself on the bed.
//Hack music "Fated" -GHS
I wanted to complete food preparation while it was still bright, but,
my willpower lacks the fire.
//沸かない prettier than 湧かない -GHS
When yet my wish is a simple one.
And while I have been relying on the walkthrough notebooks... three days have passed... and I haven't brought back a single piece of our unity.
//Why hide it at this point. -GHS
Unity...
The Broadcast Club, assembled whole, moving as if one into activities.
A cheerful pleasurable wholesome radio broadcast.
Because of the nature of the notebooks, their conclusion is not recorded.
Which method approaches the ending I wish is something I cannot discern.

[Taichi]
"Thursday, Friday, Saturday..."

How many days are left now?
I would have preferred not knowing,
that this world would come to an end.

[Taichi]
"Ngggh..."

A groan, low.
The resentment for this frustratingly slow reality that still exists in this inexplicable world.
Three days at most, at best four.

[Taichi]
"A pittance of a time... what could I even do..."

Fists clenching.
The friction of my emotions shaking into a boiling that heats my body in ways that yet resemble anger.
However long it takes---
............
......
...
//Thursday September 10, 1998 -GHS
I acted.
Consulting the descriptions in the notebook, on the spot and on the fly I took the most suitable actions.
For the sake of happiness.
For the sake of building unity.
Fellowship - friendship - bonds.
//Still see Family Project. -GHS
For the sake of these shamelessly transparent things.
//The vague undertone of lie... -GHS
And then, the end of a wasted day came.
Without even the gain of a trifle of hypocrisy---
............
......
...
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS
It became Friday.
By all rights, this is the time where there should be a change in the relationship with each person.
But having progressed to the role of all-appealing histrion, I have wasted time while obtaining nothing.
//Damn, that nearly isn't in the dictionary. -GHS
Not from Mimi-senpai, not from Touko, not from Kiri, not from Miki...
Our mutual distances continue to feel hopelessly vast.
//That's not a problem, since looking closely, that's exactly what happened in every single individual route. After all, what he wants isn't something he can't obtain because he's Ebul, it's something that cannot be period. -GHS
............
For half a day I bustle around, and no results.

[Taichi]
"Sigh."

I was tired.
Squatting down in front of the main gate, face through knees, stumped hopelessly just a few steps ahead of the evening hour.
And, the lively buzzing of a crowd so familiar to my skin approaches from the distance.
//The term seems to specifically mean that kind of sound. Youko is said to live in the world called reality, so that distant place may well be it. This could be more hinting of the real nature of things: Youko indeed lives in 'reality', as she's just Taichi in drag, living another life. After all, she still exists after Taichi leaves. Maybe. -GHS
It's Youko-chan.
So defenseless. It's rare.

[Youko]
"...something you need help with?

She says that as she stands in front of me.

[Taichi]
"Nah, it's just that right now..."

And even though I had just deflected it, I accidentally asked a question,
for in my mental state I would have even clutched at straws.

[Taichi]
"Say... I'm wondering how can I do it, how can I make things go well with everyone I mean."
[Taichi]
"Getting everybody in good terms with each other and participating to the Mimi-senpai's club activities, living our adolescence in moderation, joking around, laughing... does that route even exist?"
[Taichi]
"One where we can solve our disputes and there's reciprocal respect and where there's hope..."
[Taichi]
"Having friendly fights, making an air check of the broadcast scenario with everybody, coping with our troubles via collaboration...
[Taichi]
"I want to know... isn't there?"

Her being her, couldn't she possibly know of it?
That is the faint hope I embrace.

[Youko]
"There isn't, I think."

[Taichi]
"..."

Her voice flat in tone I hear as colder than normal.

[Youko]
"That possibility does not exist anywhere, I think."
[Youko]
"In this world, with things being this way, for Taichi to reach the point where it's possible to  mediate friendship with everybody and head safely to club... what is needed is either more time, or a better situation to start from, no other possibility."
[Youko]
"Neither of which Taichi has."
[Youko]
"There are absolute limits."
//See CCD0009 now. Taichi, to her, is only doing what's permitted and no more. -GHS
[Youko]
"Therefore however much effort you make it will be for nothing, I think."
//...and therefore that doing so is pointless. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...right."

I was told, very clearly and thoroughly, that there isn't.
//A route like etc. etc. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But saying all this, it's not fair... that's a cold equation that you have there."
//The term is specifically the title of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cold_Equations and the trope it popularized (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdEquation) seems to apply, at least tangentially. -GHS

The girl does not respond.
Standing still, she waits for my words.
//"She" knows him well, for that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Every time, don't we have our start from a situation where we're broken apart and scattered around?"
//For this particular バラバラ, see CCA0028B -GHS
[Taichi]
"And it ends, with nothing accomplished yet... it loops... and how many weeks of a disgusting everyday even..."
[Taichi]
"The hell of a joke is even this!"

Holding my head, at wit's end.
That which would fill the hunger of my heart is something that does not exist.

[Youko]
"Taichi... those notebooks, they are not all of them."

Abruptly she opens her mouth.

[Taichi]
"What's that?"

[Youko]
"There were also notebooks that show much more catastrophic histories and possibilities."
//Records of history, indeed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And where are they?"

[Youko]
"...hidden."
[Youko]
"So that they would not wound you."
[Youko]
"Or possibly... make you give up."
//In order not to make him give up... or viceversa. It has to be ambiguous; she wants Taichi to give up trying to make things good with others. The problem begins if he just gives up and starts doing nothing but murdering or lets himself be killed. Of course she can't imagine the idea he'd ever attempt to destroy the ring and eject the remaining people from his delusion - let alone ever manage to defeat her. -GHS
[Youko]
"...wanna see?"
//No answer, but we see later they somehow magically appear in the hokora. And right after the world "shifts" as to make him forget he ever went to the hokora at all. As if they've been always there, and Youko somehow had the power to 'censor' them from Taichi's sight. After all, consider the alternative: that she's speedread ALL OF THEM in the time before Taichi goes to the hokora, i.e. 6-7 hours at best. But there's still more in there that Taichi can even read! -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

A catastrophic history...
//The history of the world. -GHS

[Youko]
"However much you flounder for a foothold, however much you struggle,"
[Youko]
"among all the possibilities that exist, a person capable of understanding you... there isn't."
//She's approaching this from an egotistic standpoint. She's assuming Taichi's all doing this for his own selfish emo wish of being understood. She's not wrong; she simply can't comprehend the idea that one would ever want to do anything else. -GHS
[Youko]
"That is, me alone excluded."
//This isn't a contradiction, if we continue with the idea that she does not exist. -GHS
[Youko]
"...and now, if you would please give me your understanding on this, it would be about time I think."

[Taichi]
"I understand, I do."
[Taichi]
"And if I can add something, you are NOT in love with me either, aren't you?!"
//If he's not worthless, Youko can't be the only one to love him; if Youko doesn't understand him, her love is based on misapprehension. Since he can't go against this purely irrational feeling of self-worthlessness, it follows that either Youko can't love him, or he has to live with an internal contradiction that would drive him insane. The only out is leaving self-worthlessness, i.e. giving up to believing there's some kind of convenient out and living on. This is why the trigger in CCX0001 seems to be where it is. -GHS

Shouting.

[Taichi]
"The FUCK is wrong with this world!"
//Sometimes you just gotta drop'em. -GHS

A spat out my deep, deep breath,
and irritation with it.

[Taichi]
"Say... is this a parallel universe or something?"

Youko-chan stood in front of me,
and with the tip of her toes drew an 『Ｘ』 on the ground.
//There'll be two theories, and they're preceded by this. This is very possibly a hint that the theories can and should intersect. And since "X" is the symbol for "wrong", perhaps... regardless, I can't but be reminded of John 8:6 -GHS

[Youko]
"The possibilities are two."
[Youko]
"First, the axes believed linear of two worlds have intermixed, a condition in which they can reciprocally perceive each other... very SF."

Two worlds,
//Read Nihon no Sekai, the World of Japan. -GHS
twisting, overlapping... crossing.

[Taichi]
"Worlds are overlapping, then something abnormal has happened, right?"
[Taichi]
"Hmmm... and in that case, what about our world of origin? If it has been preserved as it was then---"
//He's already assuming that they've moved somehow. But how, since all she's talked about is perception? This is still important. -GHS

[Youko]
"The other one, what we see is the way that the world in which we lived in has ended."
//Both are obviously wrong in the obvious sense, and perfectly correct in another. -GHS

But she negated the easy salvation by one half.
//She seems to be just denying the part in which their original world being preserved is a *good* thing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"Reciprocal interference across Many Worlds is impossible... or was it. It's quantum mechanics."
//Well, since there's no evidence (scientific or otherwise) of parallel universes, that's true. -GHS

To speak of quantum mechanics means to bring in Dirac, but I have never read the original book.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_Quantum_Mechanics - Interesting he'd bring in Dirac when MWI is Everett, who goes entirely unmentioned. -GHS
And is a quantum mechanical interpretation even applicable to this situation to begin with?
//This seems to mean "can we apply QM to this" more than "which explanation can we use for this". Survey says... no. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...the one you said before, the SF one... what was that?"

[Youko]
"You must absolutely and necessarily choose between A and B. Which do you choose?"

[Taichi]
"...half and half I guess. I don't know which choices they are."

[Youko]
"Indeed. Our lives are built over choices without number."
[Youko]
"For example, on setting out to walk, from which foot do we move forwards?"
//That's actually a pretty bad example given most people settle on a single one for the overwhelming majority of their lives. It's like wondering which thumb goes on top when you clasp your hands: the dominant one. -GHS
[Youko]
"Which side dish of rice will we begin eating from?"
[Youko]
"Choices take place in a more microscopic world as well."
[Youko]
"Choices without number take place each and every single instant."
[Youko]
"And the world is shaped by these choices."
//Taking she's not saying that choices created actual matter, because that's another can of worms. Though it does sort of have difficulties gelling with the new CCD0009, where the actions of people are merely what's allowed. Supposing the world is made by choices, but those choices are still what's permitted. -GHS
[Youko]
"Extremely deterministically so, as well."
//MWI again, as it is deterministic (IOW no wavefunction collapse). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Deterministically..."

[Youko]
"For example, Taichi selects A. Taichi has the memory of choosing A."
[Youko]
"Yet simultaneously, on that same world axis a Taichi that has selected B also exists."
//According to MWI, the possibility exists in the same superposition, which gives apparent collapse by splitting a single decision per universe, and the "world axis" thing seems just needlessly confusing. Of course, Taichi B exists only as a pure thought experiment, not even raising to the level of hypothesis or theory; MWI is not only untested and unproven, it's currently untestable at all. There's a little more in the new material below, but this seems to be the Taichi B that the cryptic message left by Tanaka at the end of the Tower of Friends scenario on the Materials Book refers to. Except, technically, that Taichi didn't choose anything, did he? -GHS
[Youko]
"It does not imply the existence of parallel universes, however..."
//Oh yes it does! That's the whole point of MWI, that the superposition generates an infinity of universes each containing a single apparently-collapsed decision. This doesn't make any sense. It's like she's implying that the superposition stays on the same universe and it could be switched by the observer, retroactively so. This is interesting, but not MWI. -GHS
[Youko]
"Merely that in the general concept of Dirac, perception of the world of Selection B from the world of Selection A is not possible. And vice versa."
//And here we get to heart of the troll: Dirac says nothing of the sort that I can find. In fact, he had absolutely nothing to do with the development or study of MWI that I can even find. The quote "shut up and calculate!", rejecting all interpretations of QM, is falsely attributed to him - meaning he at least had a reputation of being interpretation agnostic. Considering Taichi will mention MWI by name, and also see CCZDXC, this is troll. See CCA0015C: attributing Everett's stuff to Dirac is suspiciously similar to attributing God is Dead to Kierkegaard. This is as close to the smoking gun as can be found in Cross Channel: to take this literally is to be trolled, hard. -GHS
[Youko]
"Conversely, if there is capability of observation, transfer between the worlds becomes possible."
//This is a very odd switch of subjects. This should be talking about entanglement, given MWI an observer capable of more or less consciously changing entanglement could switch universes, with retroactive effects if the entanglement changed is far enough. This is a big logic leap, and theorizing this is far beyond quantum mechanics. That's why the true troll isn't that this is all bullshit; it's that this makes very very simple sense once we move from MWI to chuuni. It's false; that's why it's true. -GHS
[Youko]
"Similarly to how the world is a completely different thing for those who could see in the ultraviolet,"
//This is a jump in subject that makes absolutely no sense... unless she knows this is about Taichi and his sight, which she does whether it's the Mystic Eyes of Alternate World Sight or him simply refusing to see the rest of the people. Two possibilities when it comes to seeing ultraviolet for humans: Aphakia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphakia or tetrachromacy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy#Possibility_of_human_tetrachromats Neither works the way Taichi's does. Him having just a (benign) cancerlike eye pattern/contact lenses and once in a while donning night vision goggles remains far more likely. -GHS
[Youko]
"one capable of observing many worlds is capable of existing in those two worlds."
[Youko]
"The instant observation comes into being, he will become an occupant of that world... or so it is thought."
//The ultraviolet thing is a possible interpretation of Taichi's eyes that can see in the dark, so this whole thing would refer to Taichi regardless. But why would she assume he can see multiple worlds? And what does this have to do with Dirac? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Observation... into being...?"
[Taichi]
"No change of the world in there, or in other words, it's just a difference in the observer, then?"
//The simplest explanation is and remains that the observer is committing a mistake, see CCA0016. Nothing has happened to the world at all. Literally him chuunin', metaphorically him refusing to see reality - all covered in a smattering of quasi-science. This works best if he understands the above refers to him. -GHS

[Youko]
"Something of that sort."
//Genius(!). -GHS
[Youko]
"However, many worlds observation is impossible in current theories."
[Youko]
"There is also no reason for us all to have transferred in unison either."
//The continued implication is that A Certain Observer moved himself and everyone else, which is what makes this work. No matter how smart she is, that's castles in the air. -GHS
[Youko]
"Therefore, SF."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."
[Taichi]
"And with regards to the second possibility?"

[Youko]
"This one is the likely correct one, I think."
//Of course not, neither is correct. -GHS
[Youko]
"In short there is no observation of another world."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm, so you say that SF interpretation of before is a no-go, right."

A noble face nods.

[Youko]
"The world, the time, the eigenhistory: all are things of continuity and sequence."
[Youko]
"In other words... time is not being rewound."
//True, except it's false. -GHSoHelpfulToday

[Taichi]
"...eh?"
[Taichi]
"But that's weird. In the diaries there are descriptions from Monday up around Saturday... and from there it returns back to Monday, doesn't it?"
//And there's absolutely nothing odd with that in the slightest, if you actually take this sentence on its face. -GHS

[Youko]
"The time loop exists in no more than appearances."
//True, except for being completely true. -GHS
[Youko]
"The natural world is not repeating the same time over and over eternally."
[Youko]
"This end is the deterministically derived end of the world."
[Youko]
"Worlds are not crossing. No unusual phenomenon is occurring. All is sequential. This possibility was permitted from the beginning of the world, and we rode down that possibility to find ourselves here, exactly where we were expected to be."
//This is what is meant with deterministic, choice -> consequence without fail. They couldn't end up anywhere else. Religiously, it's the Wages of Sin; in simplest metaphors, Taichi chose for things to be like this (if unconsciously), and there they are. The discrepancy is only whether this is caused by sci-fi phenomenons that are never explained and clarified with borderline obvious trolls, Taichi going mad in ways similar to those seen in other characters and allowed by the setting especially in the political organizational sense, or if the entire question is a troll and it's all a religious metaphor anyway. -GHS
[Youko]
"It may be seen as if an intermixing of perceptions between many worlds has occurred, however, in reality we are only advancing on a road connected by a single thread."
//Ohhh, so that's why this thing is so damn linear regardless. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The loop is only appearances, you say... but in reality, we have been subjected to a reset many times over, so..."
[Taichi]
"For this loop phenomenon to happen in our world of origin to begin with, it would mean..."

I realized.
Of course...

[Taichi]
"We could never be aware of it..."
//So there's no reason for the Sakakibara diary to be about a parallel world, regardless of whether what it says is correct or troll. So why is Miki so convinced? The simplest explanation is: for the same reason Youko is. They're all playing poor Taichi's chuuni game in one way or another. -GHS

By its nature we could never notice the occurrence of a loop.
Should the unique location that is the hokora not have existed,
the phenomenon could by no means have been discovered.
//This mess can't be figured out without the only edifice of remotely obvious religious significance in the entire story. It contains all of Taichi's sins, piled to the sky, as well as every thing that has ever happened and almost everything that can. It was obvious in retrospect. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then was this loop phenomenon preordained in this world, from the beginning? As the twilight of mankind?"

And the end of its long track,
the collapse and destruction of all land, alone, is not the Downfall.
Space-time falls into disarray and ceases to progress onwards... that is its demise.
//No, if space-time is still continuous, then it is simply progressing forwards in a different shape. An advancement in shapes not understood isn't a collapse. This may be intentional, however. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But... but say..."

[Youko]
"It has specific requirements... in this case, when the specified time on Sunday is reached, the world is at once dismantled... no more than this can be said."
[Youko]
"Following the recorded spatial information, the disassembled particles reorganize and return to the aspect of Monday."
//Recorded where? On the hard drive, for starters... -GHS

[Taichi]
"But for the world it's all continuous..."

[Youko]
"As evidence of that, I offer that shrine."
//One of the few times it's not called "hokora". 社 is not necessarily Shinto as far as shrines, though it usually is. Not that it matters; Shintoism has no religious problem accepting the existence of the Christian God as one of its Kami, or that it would be enshrined somewhere. -GHS
[Youko]
"The subject of the descriptions in the notebooks is what shows the existence of a past."
//=history. -GHS
[Youko]
"Since the past can be observed, the past exists."
[Youko]
"This world here permits a past."
[Youko]
"And then, here we are, one by one, having been dismantled many times and assembled many times."
//Kokoni -GHS
[Youko]
"...I have the feeling that we are not, strictly speaking, people anymore."

[Taichi]
"Well then, what are we?"

[Youko]
"A phenomenon."
//See CCD0009 as rewritten. -GHS

A word too appropriate that soaked into my heart.
People no more---
//Then again, the point seems to be this. Separation from God, being VN actors, being partially or completely in Taichi's mind would certainly make all them people no more. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You say that it's the single thread theory, but to my ears the first one sounds more like it. We can't discern which is correct at this point in time, you know..."
//Juuust a bit desperate. Interesting emphasis on the 'hearing'. -GHS

[Youko]
"To us it is something that we see as a loop, but what it is in reality we can't investigate."
[Youko]
"...therefore, to start with we have no choice but to adopt one of the theories we have now."
//"I dunno, but science says this, so it's gotta be one of these". Magnificently human. -GHS
[Youko]
"Presently, motion between worlds appears to be impossible, therefore it is the one without the assumption of movement, or the latter."
//The irony is that, with the new CCD0009, this is even more obviously headed towards a religious explanation. Although inadequate in the grand scheme of things, it's far more reasonable that a reader could follow this explanation into that. After all, if it's a possibility permitted, and what's permitted (CCD0009) is all but stated to be not what's made by mankind, but something that's property of a very monotheistic-sounding God, then this end of the world must be caused by this God. Ergo, that's the direction to look to. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, I see..."

Or do I now.
To me, the SF theory seems more fitting.

[Taichi]
"Suppose this is World B, would World A be left as-is?"
//If the worlds have crossed, and this are the dregs of said crossing, then the Cross World would be a World C, not B. Funny how everyone just forgets the third part in their rush to see Both Sides Of Things, isn't it. -GHS

[Youko]
"That is not a possibility I can reject, but..."

[Taichi]
"But?"

[Youko]
"What if there is some kind of phenomenic event caused by the Crossover Phenomenon?"
//Oddly, "crossover phenomenon" is in the dictionary as-is. Sorry about "phenomenic event", but that's what it says... -GHS
[Youko]
"There is plenty to think that damage has occurred in World A as well."
//No, actually, there is absolutely nothing at all whatsoever. There's not even any need to think that any world has been switched or changed, or anything of the sort. She is, still, talking out of her ass. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...the disappearance of mankind, for example?"
//Noticing that this new bit is adding nothing, just mixing and jumbling the two theories? The crossing of worlds, here, would leave them in World A but with humanity disappeared. -GHS

[Youko]
"Perhaps, maybe."
[Youko]
"Some other kind of trouble has occurred, perhaps."
[Youko]
"Somewhere in a faraway place, a star without name may have exploded, perhaps."
//And here we have the evidence of the troll: V861 Scorpii fits the bill just nicely; in other words, hello Nanaka. -GHS
[Youko]
"And it became something far more serious on this side, maybe... that is something no one could know."

Wherever you fall a pure bright hope you will never find, then?

[Taichi]
"Many Worlds... then."

The Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics does not substantiate the existence of parallel universes.
//That's the precise term that translates to MWI. http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AC%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E8%A7%A3%E9%87%88 although Wikipedia J calls it "Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation". Whatever the concept, we're talking about that specific theory, so bringing in Dirac is strong in troll. Wikipedia (E): "MWI's main conclusion is that the universe [...] is composed of a quantum superposition of very many [...] parallel universes". MWI however doesn't substantiate, or prove, the existence of parallel universes; as an interpretation, and not a theory or science, it can't substantiate anything at all. IOW, despite calling in MWI, refusing to consider Many Worlds is technically not a lie. -GHS
That is a misconception; in practice it's a much more deterministic thought experiment.
//If I picked B then 4, but then somehow could re-entangle in a world where I picked 2, then the past would change so that I've also picked A: this is what it means with determinism, and the reason for "observation" leading to world switching. This should only work in deterministic, MWI-ish interpretations, because once B is picked then 1 2 3 only exist as conjectures, not as definite events separated in discrete parallel universes as in MWI. This may be the point of Schroedinger's Cat, but I admit I'm far from sure. -GHS
In there, a World A and a World B can exist simultaneously, but it is impossible to traverse between them,
because of that very simultaneous existence.
//MWI doesn't seem to say anything at all about traveling - how could it, it's an interpretation that doesn't rise to the level of theory; multiple worlds are far from observed or proven, travel between something that may not even exist isn't even conjecturable at all. At best, this could be said to be true because it requires re-entanglement with a different choice picked -GHS
Around this part, my understanding becomes a little confused.
//Mandatory snort. -GHS

It is a matter of course.

If my concealed hidden interior is seen it's the end, all over.
//The safe is a better metaphor for this. Outside there's decoy porn. Inside is more precious porn. -GHS
I remember.

[Taichi]
"I get that... you know."
[Taichi]
"Ever since that time, so long ago!"

[Yusa]
"You have a nice room."

Doujima Yusa.
What a nice girl she was.
So naive and brave.
Even hiding the disease in the heart it's still possible to not know you are hurting someone.
//Could easily refer to both: Yusa hides her illness inside, as well, and by refusing his help when she's bullied (as is unclear, but very possible, see CCA0013), she's been hurting him as well. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Uhm... I don't understand this change, so..."
//Her first reaction is to say "uhm, what are you doing"? Come now; little Yusa's been compared to Misato (and later Miki) so many times that there's simply no way she's THIS stupid. -GHS

In my eyes, sweet water.

[Yusa]
"...Taichi-san?"

The demise... was abrupt.
//Since this scene is basically a pre-play of the Kiri bathroom scene, and another replay of CCC0000, it's safe to assume this takes place days at best after Yutaka's death. And both scenes are caused by the exact same sort of event. -GHS
The sudden materialization of my interior was, to her, like swallowing a deadly poison.

[Yusa]
"Are you even... Taichi... san?"
//See CCC0009B and CCA0009B. And it twists, and it turns. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yup, I am."

[Yusa]
"Ah, uhm... I-, I..."

[Taichi]
"So pretty, yes."
//Ambiguous once again, since he refers to his eyes just below. He could be telling her "look at how pretty my eyes are". Also it's the 'kirei' pretty, as in also "clean". -GHS

My eyes by now must've been shining,
blazing with appetite.
//vs. want. Hmmm... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Pretty, therefore, off with the clothes."
//Remember CCA0002, CCC3004. That's not an uncommon thing he does to try to lighten the mood. He could STILL be talking about himself! -GHS

[Yusa]
"......"

One who has ever been stared at by a wild carnivorous animal knows it,
what it is like to have the attention of two wide open, bulging, bloodshot eyes.
//Although the term is ギョロ目, currently among the top search result for ギョロ alone: http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%86%E3%81%95%E3%82%AE%E3%83%A7%E3%83%AD-%E3%83%95%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9-%E3%81%BE%E3%82%81%E3%82%82%E3%82%84%E3%81%97/dp/409134786X THAT IS SCARY MAN -GHS
Neither favoritism nor malice there.
A gaze enthusiastic and feverish to absurd extent that is... nevertheless hunger.
Eyes that recognize the self, the human self, as nothing but food.
Boiling hot hunger is poured inside the self.
It's possible it could, occasionally, even induce nausea.
Just like in her.
//Not even close! Youko, Taichi's trainer-mother, has taught him to do what he's doing now. He's repeating what she fed to him. Yusa's definitely gonna be overfed by her own ogre of a mother, who's likely the cause of merciless teasing at school. And she's throwing up. It's perfect sync. -GHS

[Yusa]
"N-... NOOOOOOOOO!!!"
//ぁx8 nice timing. -GHS
[Yusa]
"...I feel... sick...!"
[Yusa]
"Ngh... ngh..."

I was looking down on a squatting little girl disgustingly vomiting her guts out, a conclusion of inferior quality that I grew bored of.
//BTW, there's some odd stuff in this sentence. 嘔吐にえずく can almost be written 嘔吐に嘔吐く (there's a づ instead of a　ず, but the pronunciation is very close) -  pukingly due to puking? えずい (ezui) is Tousa-ben for "disgusting", ezuku is adverb. Emphasized puking for this. Also kudaroshi (looking down, same lateral meaning present as in English) and kudaranai (worthless) technically use the same kanji. Used look down/inferior. What odd puns, and odder placements as well. I can hardly put this down to Taichi's usual Distract With Bad Jokes behavior. -GHS
The girl broke before being broken.

[Taichi]
"......"

And then, it came that the girl began to avoid me.
//This is sort of similar to what she did to Kiri on the rooftop, except in Kiri there was no complete rejection for several reasons. Taichi was trying to rescue Yusa in the only way he knew: Alter Egos. -GHS
Her eyes changed into something that saw me as if filth.
//What SHE saw changed as well. Not unjustifiably, but the change is more important as it's part of the recurring theme. -GHS
Truth is, I was filth indeed.
I---
............

[Youko]
"If they are here you will only wound."
[Youko]
"They are but prey for you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Shaddap, that's why I toldya I get it!"

Youko-chan keeps silent.

[Taichi]
"But I if I could, I would... never... I don't want to do that..."
[Taichi]
"I should just manage somehow..."

[Youko]
"It would be best if only I were to be."
//Going by CCC0021, especially, this is another possible admission that she's a split personality. This is meant very literally: if he gives in to her truly and fully, he'd disappear. He'd be nothing but a phantom, like she is. But he'd have to give up the antenna, or anything equivalent as well. -GHS

She presses her hands to her chest.
//Doesn't seem to mean anything odd... except she may be pointing to herself. But that's not how the Japanese do it, making it extremely suspicious. And wait until she says "I'm coming" in her sex scene when the Japanese say "I'm going". -GHS

[Youko]
"Because I alone can go make this go well for you, Taichi."
//"You could get lucky mah man" + "split personality blah blah blah codfish". -GHS

Dark, sinister emotions enshrouded the lower abdomen.
CSQ 0 1 1
 - Collide
 - Endure
//Considering the whole thing above, collide seems to be the more accurate literal meaning; he's gonna try crossing fully with her (with the result expectable). The result will be more like a car crash, a mixing that is closer to two twisted metal wrecks, so I prefer it. This is metaphorically about giving in to sin and not doing so, so "eagerly give in" would work, but... for what is the turning point of the VN, that seems flat. See the new CCD0022A for more - waaay more on this. -GHS
