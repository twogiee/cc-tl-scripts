So, returning home.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

There is no one.
Mutsumi-san's very shapes aren't there.
She would greet me warmly on those days she came home early.
//...meaning this is simply not one of those days. And we just never see one, coincidentally. -GHS
She would make me dinner.
She loved to fill the table with her cooking.
A manly cuisine.
It's part of her job, probably.
//Compare Yusa's mother... except for the looks, then. -GHS
Big-hearted, powerful.
We'd tell jokes to each other.
//Meaning he'd molest her, too? -GHS
She was a nice person.
But now, the top of the table is but an empty flat space.
There's no rising steam of food.

[Taichi]
"...but I'm hungry."
//Next time don't eat Kiri's bolts. -GHS

I brought over cup ramen from the Tasaki Store.
Let's just eat.
Whoops, can't use the electric heater.
//As ever, the suspicious "can't use" that can mean "doesn't work", but not necessarily so. -GHS
In the garden there's a small space just for parties, I could just boil water there, but,
//庭には (told you) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Annooow'n. (How annoying!)"

I decided to eat it as it is.
Scrunch, scrunch (noodles)
Gulp, gulp (water)
Scrunch, scrunch, scrunch (noodles)
Gulp, gulp, gulp (water)
Scrunch, scrunch, scrunch, scrunch (noodles)
Cah-runch... (dried menma)

[Taichi]
"...this is just pointless."
//7xthings in parenthesis, but! 9xscrunch 5*gulp 1*cah-runch... 15=6. Indeed, without boiling the water there's one thing missing. Also, if the 'ba' in bari-bari (scrunch) is to be taken as a katakana 'ha', as eight, and 'go' in goku (gulp) is 5, then we have a grand total of 9x8 + 5*5 = 97 9+7=16 -> 7. -GHS

Am I even having a real meal here?
I knew it, the fall of mankind's harsh one, yes.
//See CCB2010 -GHS
Lots and lots of inconveniences around.
I ignite a candle.
I had decided to keep a diary.
Sorta Hemingwayish.
//Hemingway, like other famous diarists, however used a Moleskine diary. Oh, I remember those... -GHS
I search for a college notebook to use as diary, but there were none anywhere.
//This is a specific kind of notebooks, so there's nothing strange about the term... or is there, since the term 'college' was removed in the PS2 version alone (as with the line about Hemingway, believe it or not). The notebooks vanished as things inside the hokora do not replicate outside post-loop. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

But I was sure there I had so many stocked up.
//Maybe nothing suspicious about this again, but he can't be expecting to run out of them, can he? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Inside the safe?
Just in case I'll try to investigate.
My safe is fundamentally a storehouse for porn books.
//See CCB2009 -GHS
This being a fireproof safe, so regardless of housework my Eros will be safeguarded.
//Unless the housework is made by a near-psychic tsundere live-in. -GHS
For purposes of investigation, I opened the safe.
............
Thirty minutes later, I shut the safe.
There were no notebooks here.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

This is bad, I lost a lot of time pointlessly dammit.
Seriously, though... when it comes to the contents of the safe... hoh hoh hoh!
//Doesn't フフフ just look like 777? -GHS
Damn that sinful, tiny peach-pink space.
//That means the... oh, you can figure out THIS much, right. -GHS
So then, where did those notebooks go then. I have no clue.
Memory loss?

[Taichi]
"More and more I seem to improve and polish my Heroic Protagonist characteristics... ah, right."
//True Protagonists Have Memory Loss after all, see Final Fantasy VII for one of the most important examples. In fact, given Cloud was faking being everything he claimed to be, and his memory loss was due to a traumatic event that pushed him into that fakery... -GHS

The notebooks Youko-chan brought me.
//It's impossible to tell how many Taichi has burned through. As far as we know, after Week 3, Taichi gets a new bundle every week or so. That may even be why he had a stack in the first place. -GHS
That's the Best of Timings.
//NOT SUSPICIOUS AT ALL. -GHS
...she's really divinely inspired, isn't she.
//Still trolling you. -GHS
Crinkle-crinkle I peel the shrinkwrap.
//http://item.rakuten.co.jp/keitai/256-periperi-/ it's even more useless than sheets of bubble wrap. -GHS
So then, to write?

[Taichi]
"..."

Don't got pen.
It's nowhere in sight.

[Taichi]
"Inside the safe?"

I open the safe once again, for the purpose of searching for a pen.
//Scene may be a joke, but his return to porn every single time something doesn't immediately go his way is certainly interesting. -GHS
............
Forty-five minutes later, I shut the safe.
A pen there was not.
Love there was.

[Taichi]
"...Wheee〜w."

Though I made effort to hurry, this series of battles is meaningless oh yes.♪
Curse that inveigling little dream box of allurement!
//夢箱 -GHS
The pen had fallen off the side of the desk.
I write the diary.
I ended up needing a dictionary.
//.............................. -GHS
But fact is, there is no dictionary.

[Taichi]
"..."

I open the safe.
............
One hour and twenty-seven minutes later,
//8-7 minutes later. He spends 152 minutes total 1+5+2=8. Eight is associated with too much time on porn. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...whew."

I got too much hustle on, I do.
The Ultimate Dakimakura (product name) felt for some reason excessively good and cut it out.
//Going with a net change at the end. -GHS
It was already past ten o'clock.
//That means he started at ~7:30. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoa?!"

The extra-large candle had already disappeared.
Dammit, I spent too much time in despondency.
//Hopeless person. -GHS
Therefore, these novelty items of a Dakimakura fan...
//I don't think we WANT to know. Novelty item may be in the JList sense of "it's a vibrator, but for legal reason we sell it as a massager". -GHS
But if I don't write the diary...
I light up a new candle, and square off with the notebook.
//I wonder if this is how Cross Channel was written. -GHS
