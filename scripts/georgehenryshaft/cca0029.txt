"...well then."
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
HACK boy have we not seen the last of this yet... -GHS

Mid-morning, when the temperature is still not so high,
I come to the rooftop, alone.
I look up at the steel tower that makes up the infrastructure of the antenna.
This is... certainly not a job that can be performed alone, isn't it.
A warped antenna, assembled by novices.
Its shape became like that of a monster of wavelength and directionality.
//Oh c'mon, it still makes sense so far. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then,"

I decided to set about work.
Or so I do, with my specific technical knowledge approximable to nonexistent.
But I'll be alright.
I have asked Misato-senpai using indirect investigative methods.
//Translation: "I sorta looked at what she was doing". -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm sure... like this and... this."
//HACK fade to black -GHS

...
......
.........

[Taichi]
"Dammit, I got no idea."

[Kurosu Taichi]
slightly weakened by the conveniences of civilization.

[Tomoki]
"...what'cha doing now."

[Taichi]
"'Wow, the work has progressed this much, Peke-kun sugoi!, Prezy super deeply moved, Prezy sooo wet, kissy-kissy!'... or words to that effect. That is my goal. Hail, Tomoki-Sensei."
//Should be obvious from context what he means? As if I cared! Random Japanese is funny in its own way. 'buchuu' sounds close to 'buchou', so tweaked to fit both, because... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Prezy-kiss ain't happening though."
//Ick. See CCA0015B for the first time this pun came 'round. He's wrong, see CCC4019 for the payoff to this. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"Club activities?"

[Taichi]
"Yeppy yep."
//See CCA0003. -GHS

Languidly Tomoki sits on the bare ground.

[Tomoki]
"Here."

[Taichi]
"Oh, thank ye."

Canned juice.
//See CCD1001. -GHS
Wasn't particularly cold, though.
//There's no fridge anywhere near, though those of Misato's were cold (fnarr, fnarr). -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...Taichi, why all this enthusiasm?"

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, it's Seriously Questioning Adolescent flavored!"
//The juice. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That don't seaweed into sense."
//S/b Segue. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hyyyper funny, that joke."

[Tomoki]
"Come on, come on, you hand over this stuff my way by your own, don't go dodging it!"

Tomoki took out a postcard.

[Taichi]
"Handed over, or should you say, posted by human hands don't you."
//Meaning he put them in their mailboxes manually. Whether the mailman delivers or not is actually irrelevant. See CCC3017. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...why activities now?"
//This ends with a Kansai ~nan. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I have one question, if I may."

With a straight face.

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"It's about... you and your nee-san, however. Can I?"

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"It's a serious question!"

[Tomoki]
"...OK. What?"

[Taichi]
"Well,"

With a little nervousness I push out the question.
//See CCA0030. Hmmm. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How come you're from Kanto but you drop in some fake-Kansai accent in your sentences?"
//No need to specify more, since nothing of that is understandable any way through the translation unless I were to attempt making his speech sound way more absurd than this one single sentence deserves. And gladden me with understanding that I could -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That's the single most unrelated question to Aneki!!!"
[Tomoki]
"I'm leaving..."

[Taichi]
"Waiiit, waiiit, gladden me with holding on! Romance wasn't built in a day!"
//...and see CCA0023, CCA0027, CCC0026. He's trying to repeat the Beach even here. Rome will return, with its SEVEN hills. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Thank you for making me waste some time, Taichi-kun."

[Taichi]
"Don't become so cynical!"
//This was in English. Since cynicism and sarcasm are sorta the same word in Japanese, given they infamously don't really 'get' sarcasm, I suppose Tanaka wanted to be exact with the words here. As this distinction happens a few times, I rendered all the kanji versions as 'sarcasm'. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I mean this thing here! Come on, isn't having an objective the way to gaining something to live for?"
//Antenna, club activities, AND Misato. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...something to live for, huh."
[Tomoki]
"But once you have food to live, that'd be good to have, though."
//Double but. Leaving it a tad ambiguous. After all, they don't exactly have much in the way of provisions. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And this is the sort of thing that I have been longing for."

[Tomoki]
"This, what?"

[Taichi]
"Vitelloni Graffitea."
//青春群像 is a word meaning just that, but oddly enough, it's also the Japanese title of a seminal 1950s Fellini movie http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Vitelloni I suspect this may be a reference to that and not just the word because of the second part; that's a not-uncommon transliteration for Graffiti, which, regardless of movies, with the first word suggests American Graffiti. Which was set just a few years later than Vitelloni, though it's newer by two decades, so the two fit the tone. Plus the odd tweak at the end to make a flavor of tea, in both languages, there it is. Well, that, or I dunno at all. Oh, and it means what goes on in CCA0030, especially. -GHS
[Taichi]
"What flavor do you think that has?"
//Bitter and Sweet? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Nah, that ain't a tea."
//As for what Tomoki gets, I dunno. -GHS

Tomoki gets up, and walks around the perimeter of the antenna.

[Tomoki]
"With this... just with this thing?"

[Taichi]
"Well, if you have something to do yourself that's fine too."

[Tomoki]
"...to do, hmmm. Not really. Looking for goods and materials, maybe."

[Taichi]
"At least in these club activities there is some hope."

[Tomoki]
"This could do nothing but confirm that it's hopeless, ya know?"

[Taichi]
"Then there is the hope that we can confirm that it's hopeless."
//Basically the only reason for anyone to write something this complicated, really. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...I just don't get the way you think, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Dooon't you nooow?"

[Tomoki]
"Why're you looking like you're having fun now."

[Taichi]
"Hehheh."

[Tomoki]
"Really, you're unbelievable."

Tomoki wiped his undereye with his arm.

[Tomoki]
"What I know is... just how to wire this antenna to the mobile equipment."

[Taichi]
"Then help you whelp!"
//not so much aggressive as sorta curt -GHS

[Tomoki]
"What's with that, at least look a little like you're emotionally moved or something!"

[Taichi]
"D-dummy, my heart of hearts is crying, baka! Wailing, baka! This is the utsuge route!"
//Tsundere Mode! Girly, for starters, which needs much broader strokes in English. Baka works well for strawman tsundere (is that a term well it is now). That last one is "weeping emotional route", which is, well. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"None of that I can seee〜."

[Taichi]
"But it's corny to get all tearful with males! Go trigger that event with your nee-chan, you bastard!"
//Curiously, this sentence ends with 'wai', which Secret Information (dictionary) reports as 'mainly male, signifying emotion'. I guess the point is the vaguely contradictory nature? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Nastyyy!"

[Taichi]
"Well, if that's your decision then get to work you whelp! Broadcast is scheduled for tomorrow ya know."
//Half-mirroring above -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, yeah."
[Tomoki]
"Well, I'll go bring up the equipment."
//There was an empty line here, just a line feed. Maybe Taichi should've said something? -GHS
[Tomoki]
"...Taichi?"

A leg inside the school building, Tomoki stops.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Tomoki]
"...I thought you would tell me to put things right with Aneki, for sure, that a younger brother should help his Aneki."

[Taichi]
"Naaah, sibling quarreling's a very respectable way of life it is. Don'tcha stop."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Basically this is about you helping the greatness that is I."

Puff that chest with pride!

[Tomoki]
"...what're you a VIP."

[Taichi]
"After all, I am the Overlord of all those of Conformity Coefficient 80 and Over."
//8 and 0, the Error and the loop. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...and I will still be this Overlord's normal friend from now on."
[Tomoki]
"Because... I don't hate that of you."
//See CCA0007. -GHS

He quickly vanishes inside the school building. As if running away.

[Taichi]
"'Iiii don't haaate that of youuu'... pffft!"
//Ridiculing. -GHS

After Tomoki had said that, his face had instantly reddened up to the physical blushing limits of mankind.
//awww they do love each o--wait waIT WAAAAAIT -GHS

[Taichi]
"If it makes you embarrassed then don'tcha say it! Seriously."
//HACK sky (not the antenna? 'K...) -GHS

I look up at the antenna.

[Taichi]
"But with this, we're a little on the way aren't we."

Fun pretend-a-club-activities.
They may become precious memories.
For the sake of one day having that fun dream---
//See CCA0030, but best seen in the ending. -GHS
Certainly.
Forever.
For the sake of thinking... thank you.
//HACK fade to black -GHS
I will be fighting.
