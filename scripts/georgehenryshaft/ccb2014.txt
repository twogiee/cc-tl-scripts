Casually, I turned my head towards the entrance.
CIN 4 -640 0 0 0
CR 1
Glaaare.
//7 letters total -GHS

[Taichi]
".....bfhwt?!?!"

I spat out water.
Hyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyh?!
//ぃx18, 8 is obvious and 8-1=7 -GHS
We're being looked, we're being looked aaaaaat!!!
Since when, since wheeeeen?!

[Taichi]
"AhWahWahWahWahWahWah!"

Right and left and here and there, flapping about in confusion.
Junior (drooping) was also flailing about in confusion.
Like in that masterpiece music video thriller from some years ago, I lose my mind as I perform a full-body reproduction of a certain talented dancer.
//No question http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson%27s_Thriller Also, second zombie reference in the same day. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

Motion of the lips.
I could only read it:
                  T R A I T O R
//no one's gonna save you from the beast about strike -GHS

[Taichi]
"HyYyYh!"

They move more.
            I   D O T H   B E L L O W
              F O R   R E V E N G E
//14 letters. http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1320283438 replaced wif some semi-random spear shakin'. -GHS
I-, I'll be done in?!
//Why would he be even remotely afraid of what Youko would do to him, at this point at least? -GHS
I cover my face.
But however long passes, the killer curse does not strike.
//Curiously, Megami Tensei tops the ranks for 呪殺攻撃. Unfortunately, MegaTen Wiki doesn't have much of a translation http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Skills so if it's a reference to that, there's no relevant official English term. I guess I'll just screw it and pretend it's a sort of Higurashi reference despite it obviously not being so (different kanji, not just because of the incompatible timeline). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ehhh?"

As I look, she is nowhere to be seen anymore.

[Taichi]
"...she let it go this time...?"

I had forgotten the dreadful watchdog that had hers as a name.
What an Hyper Adversary she makes, with sensing skills matching those of a mother who is searching for her son's porn books.
//See CCB2009. See say how come it's pronounced Touko instead of Fuyuko it's like confusing with Youko around... -GHS

[Taichi]
"At least I survived for now."

I put my mouth to the canteen anew.
My throat is as arid as a desert.
Casually, I turned my attention towards Touko.
//See above. -GHS
On her bare buttocks, magic marker scribbling.

[Taichi]
"Bfhwt!"

Re-spitting.
In that flash of an instant!
And without any sign of her presence at all!
//And who's sitting riiight next to Touko? Why, Taichi of course! -GHS
A Super Ninja?
//See CCA0030. -GHS
What did she even write...
I give a look.
『Worthless whore』 『Cum dumpster』
//One word per buttcheek? Split as it's better visible. Console: "Pervert Woman / Enemy of Taichi". Latter's interesting. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Spiteful!!!"

Hell hath no fury...
//Not even bothering with literal here, especially since we already shaken 'em spears (and it won't be the last time). -GHS
First things first, let's put poor Touko back in order,
cleaning her of bodily fluids, straightening her dress.
Underwear... I shall be keeping those.
Ah, the writing on her butt... oil-based.

[Taichi]
"Ooh-key."

Since she can't see them by herself, it'd be fine leaving them there, but,

[Touko]
"...nh...... Tai, chi..."

[Taichi]
"......"

I go to the Art room.
I grab the paint thinner from the teacher's ready room and return.
I diluted and soaked a rag in it.
Wipe.
Wipe.
Wipe.
With a slip and a slide I resurrect her eggy ass.
//At least it's not 50% rebuilt from the 800x600 data, 20% PS2 emulator screenshots and 30% Xbox 360 video capture, eh? See next script for payoff. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Apologies... Touko."

GlRlRlRlRlRlRlRlR!
//No, really, it's 8 る instead of 9. I WONDER WHY. -GHS
It's my belly bug.
//Juuust moments after "seeing" Youko. Two routes in a row! What a coincidence. -GHS
It's like a wild beast.
Should I just call it my belly beast then.

[Taichi]
"Hungry..."

And,
PoPoPoPoPoing.
That came from Touko's belly.

[Taichi]
"...heh."
//These are useless with the new flashback opening -GHS
