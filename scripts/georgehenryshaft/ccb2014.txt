Casually, I turned my head towards the entrance.
CIN 4 -640 0 0 0
CR 1
//HACK slide from left instead. Using CIN as the normal sliding keeps thinking the left corner of the image needs to go to the center of the screen, but all insert CGs are actually full 640x480 pre-centered pics with the rest in alpha transparency, so it doesn't work correctly and the insert ends up way to the right. So I compensate and sometimes it works as intended so the image ends up screwed up regardless, and therefore to hell with all that. -GHS
Glaaare.
//7 letters total -GHS

[Taichi]
".....bfhwt?!?!"

I spat out water.
Hyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyh?!
//ぃx18, 8 is obvious and 8-1=7 -GHS
We're being looked, we're being looked aaaaaat!!!
Since when, since wheeeeen?!

[Taichi]
"AhWahWahWahWahWahWah!"

Right and left and here and there, flapping about in confusion.
Junior (drooping) was also flailing about in confusion.
Like in that masterpiece music video thriller from some years ago, I lose my mind as I perform a full-body reproduction of a certain talented dancer.
//No question http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson%27s_Thriller Also, second zombie reference in the same day. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

Motion of the lips.
I could only read it:
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
                  T R A I T O R
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"HyYyYh!"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

They move more.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
            I   D O T H   B E L L O W
              F O R   R E V E N G E
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
I-, I'll be done in?!
//Why would he be even remotely afraid of what Youko would do to him, at this point at least? -GHS
I cover my face.
But however long passes, the killer curse does not strike.
//Curiously, Megami Tensei tops the ranks for 呪殺攻撃. Unfortunately, MegaTen Wiki doesn't have much of a translation http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Skills so if it's a reference to that, there's no relevant official English term. I guess I'll just screw it and pretend it's a sort of Higurashi reference despite it obviously not being so (different kanji, not just because of the incompatible timeline). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ehhh?"

As I look, she is nowhere to be seen anymore.

[Taichi]
"...she let it go this time...?"

I had forgotten the dreadful watchdog that had hers as a name.
What an Hyper Adversary she makes, with sensing skills matching those of a mother who is searching for her son's porn books.
//See CCB2009. See say how come it's pronounced Touko instead of Fuyuko it's like confusing with Youko around... -GHS

[Taichi]
"At least I survived for now."

I put my mouth to the canteen anew.
My throat is as arid as a desert.
Casually, I turned my attention towards Touko.
//See above. -GHS
On her bare buttocks, magic marker scribbling.

[Taichi]
"Bfhwt!"

Re-spitting.
In that flash of an instant!
And without any sign of her presence at all!
//And who's sitting riiight next to Touko? Why, Taichi of course! -GHS
A Super Ninja?
//See CCA0030. -GHS
What did she even write...
I give a look.
『Worthless whore』 『Cum dumpster』
//One word per buttcheek? Split as it's better visible. Console: "Pervert Woman / Enemy of Taichi". Latter's interesting. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Spiteful!!!"

Hell hath no fury...
//Not even bothering with literal here, especially since we already shaken 'em spears (and it won't be the last time). -GHS
First things first, let's put poor Touko back in order,
cleaning her of bodily fluids, straightening her dress.
Underwear... I shall be keeping those.
Ah, the writing on her butt... oil-based.

[Taichi]
"Ooh-key."

Since she can't see them by herself, it'd be fine leaving them there, but,

[Touko]
"...nh...... Tai, chi..."

[Taichi]
"......"
//HACK wipe to black... -GHS

I go to the Art room.
//HACK ...and back. -GHS
I grab the paint thinner from the teacher's ready room and return.
I diluted and soaked a rag in it.
Wipe.
Wipe.
Wipe.
//HACK now on the same page (this was likely always intended) -GHS
With a slip and a slide I resurrect her eggy ass.
//At least it's not 50% rebuilt from the 800x600 data, 20% PS2 emulator screenshots and 30% Xbox 360 video capture, eh? See next script for payoff. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Apologies... Touko."

GlRlRlRlRlRlRlRlR!
//No, really, it's 8 る instead of 9. I WONDER WHY. -GHS
It's my belly bug.
//Juuust moments after "seeing" Youko. Two routes in a row! What a coincidence. -GHS
It's like a wild beast.
Should I just call it my belly beast then.

[Taichi]
"Hungry..."

And,
PoPoPoPoPoing.
That came from Touko's belly.

[Taichi]
"...heh."
//These are useless with the new flashback opening -GHS
