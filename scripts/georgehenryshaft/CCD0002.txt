It was a bolt out of the blue.
//This is many months before the antenna, but I don't have any non-antenna flashback BG of the rooftop data to work from. Even the 360 version keeps it. Well, let's call it Taichi misremembering some facts as well. -GHS
HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
I was a high school freshman when I was reunited with Sakuraba.
//1,5-2 years after the theater thing. Interesting he comes after him on the rooftop. This place used to be really popular; in a sense, perhaps, the death of Yutaka was also the Downfall of this as a place of gathering. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"You remember about me?"
//The hollow brackets were removed in all versions. Since it's just a flashback, there's no need. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ah?"
//He doesn't even remember him... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"From the school festival play."

[Taichi]
"...it's you."

[Sakuraba]
"I'm Sakuraba Hiroshi."
[Sakuraba]
"I don't like being called by my last name. Please call me Hiro."
//ヒロって hirotte = pick up/find/gather... -GHS

There was certainly something familiar in that face,
but with bad memories attached to it.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK replacing these with fades like the flashback opening. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hands off."

[Sakuraba]
"...you mind this?"

[Taichi]
"I wouldn't not mind, wouldn't I?"

[Sakuraba]
"Apologies."

[Taichi]
"Forget apologizing. Don't get close."

[Sakuraba]
"Forgive me."

[Taichi]
"Forgive you? Never get close or talk to me again!"

[Sakuraba]
"By the way, on the 'net yesterday---』

[Taichi]
"......"

Undeterred. Unlearning. Undiscouraged.
That's the kind of guy Sakuraba seemed to be.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK different fade -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Yo."

[Taichi]
"I told you to stay away and don't talk to me!"
//Now he's just Touko. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Did you do the assignment?"
//Curiously, the only homework we ever hear from Gunjou is the diary exchange. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Can't you hear with those ears of yours or something?"

[Sakuraba]
"Ah, I can't hear. Just on one side."

[Taichi]
"...huh?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's from when I got a nice thing from you."

I hit him, for sure,
but it was just to defend my chastity.
//...not that he's chaste. Or was he? Perhaps that line from CCA0013 being missing here is intentional. If Youko doesn't exist, then his first was Touko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...and so what. It was legitimate self-defense."

[Sakuraba]
"Naturally. You're not to blame."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"I was so immature."
[Sakuraba]
"I think... that I was emotionally moved."
[Sakuraba]
"Because you were so beautiful on that stage."
//And he never, ever, ever mentions Youko. Or ever interacts with her... throughout the ENTIRE VN. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh so it was. Thanks. Doesn't make me happy though."

[Sakuraba]
"Be at ease. There is nothing impure anymore inside of me."

[Taichi]
"...nothing?"
//He doubts and mistrusts. This further strengthens the idea that he also doubts Yutaka's recovery and fears for Kiri. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Nothing. No more. There were all kinds of shocks."
[Sakuraba]
"Feels like all the incontrollable impure things have vanished from inside me."

[Taichi]
"Sooo yer some impotent son of a bitch, right."

[Sakuraba]
"Yah, so I am."

And he even had the guts to laugh.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK different fade, doll right away -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Yo, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...you again..."
[Taichi]
"And I went and felt all relieved that you had gone and disappeared for a while."

[Sakuraba]
"I went to excavate fossils."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

That was cryptic.
//I don't think it's a pun, but what it means strictly speaking is also unclear. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"I was thinking it was ammonite, but it was a beetle larva."
//The obvious gag (they look sort of similar) is there, but it being Sakuraba, him looking for non-living rocks and finding something similar-looking but alive is SYMBOLISM!!!-worthy. This flows right into the Peanut Persimmon: a peanut snack can't possibly grow into a tree... can it? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you dumb or something?"
//HACK to black -GHS

............
//HACK different fade -GHS
There was one day when I failed to get lunch,
meal tickets and bread both sold out.
//That's possibly when he started calling pizzas in...? Maybe he wasn't rich yet. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Yo, alone?"

[Taichi]
"..."

Paf-paf-paf!
//See CCC3019A -GHS

[Taichi]
"The hell you doing!"

Procured bread, and a mountain of it.
//See CCA0002. No, I'm not overdoing this yet. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Bought all kinds."
[Sakuraba]
"I'm looking for most delicious."

[Taichi]
"...don't just bring me stuff."

[Sakuraba]
"You eat too now."

[Taichi]
"Don'wanna."

[Sakuraba]
"There's too many to eat alone."
//See CCA0022. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"Hoy, this curry bread's so good that you wouldn't believe ya know?"

[Taichi]
"......"

I tried eating.

[Taichi]
"Bh-, bleeeeeah!"
//Oe? -GHS

Disgusting.
//See CCX0001. He'll eat nothing else. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You kidding me now!"

[Sakuraba]
"These pork cutlet sandwiches are worthless. Have 'em."

I tried eating.

[Taichi]
"...ain't this good?"

[Sakuraba]
"It is? Isn't your taste a bit strange?"
//Get it? Because Sakuraba doesn't belong to this world anymore! Also he's a zombie. -GHS

Yours is!
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK different fade -GHS
The actual school hours are long in the curriculum of Gunjou.
//Things would seem to end well after six PM in fact, meaning the club hours are included in the curriculum. -GHS
The lessons may be over, but the front gate won't open for thirty more minutes.
Those thirty minutes of wait in front of the gate were always a time of boredom.

[Sakuraba]
"Going home?"

[Taichi]
"...yup."

He lines up next to me.

[Sakuraba]
"Birds are nice. Next time I'm born again, I'll be a bird."
//That's where Tori from Family Project comes from. ...at this point I can't even think that as a joke. Of course "born again" is lateral, so "next time I'm born again" is to be taken literally: he did so once. -GHS

That's what he said, all of a sudden.

[Taichi]
"Your head looks like it's already flying in the sky though."

[Sakuraba]
"Hahahah!"

[Taichi]
"...do you even understand sarcasm?"
//HACK to black -GHS

............
//HACK different fade -GHS
I became a member of the Broadcast Club.
And the very first day I showed face in the club room,
//Hum, see CCD1001. This isn't quite right. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What, you're here too...?"

[Sakuraba]
"How about mate-ing."

[Taichi]
"Ain't no way we're 'mating'!"
//Explanation of this difference with lots of condescension and perhaps bad translingual punnery. -GHS

As for Tomoki, he came in a little bit later.
//Actually unclear if he means "a few days/weeks" later, or just moments later in the same scene. -GHS
Mimi-senpai seemed to have been the scout.

[Tomoki]
"Shima Tomoki's who I am so... nice to meet you."
//Hard to source, but likely his usual (fake) Kansai. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"I'm Sakuraba Hiroshi. I don't like being called by my last name. Please call me Hiro."

[Tomoki]
"...well... eventually..."

Splendidly pushed off-balance.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK re-fade in (with the different fade) -GHS
The three of us spent our prescribed hours in the club room.
By habit.
//HACK both doll simultaneously -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Told ya, it is not like that... why'd you keep making that error on purpose!"

[Sakuraba]
"'Cause it looks more interesting this way."

[Tomoki]
"Shogi is a contest you know!"
//TL note: a contest is something you win or lose. As for what is often known as Chinese Chess, no idea because I can't use google anymore. Not since I googled... *that*... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"The stuff I do gotta be interesting."
//More meta, of course. Possibly VN stuff, too, since that'd be his character. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"Hoy, Taichi, how about it? Come play."

[Taichi]
"...huh."

I went and shrugged my shoulders.

[Tomoki]
"...he gives me the creeps, that Kurosu."
//Or '黒須' are bad kanji, but that's obviously wrong; all kanji are bad. Which reminds me: death to feelings! -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"He does? I like him."

Even that whispered conversation was audible to me.
//...but he can't hear the cicadas anymore. His ears are as good as his memory. -GHS
Please stop,
that's what I wanted to shout.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK different fade, doll right away -GHS

[Tomoki]
"But that was your job!"

[Taichi]
"...I thought I didn't really have to do it though."
//He's trying as hard as he can to be unreliable and hateable. He's just trying to avoid all contact. Misato may have forced him to be part of things, but it wasn't her who made him quite the pervert we know. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You did have to, because you're a club member."

[Taichi]
"Get off me, Siscon-kun."

At those words loaded with scorn, Tomoki's face for an instant turned crimson red.

[Tomoki]
"...really youuu!"
//HACK CG, independent CG shake, SFX -GHS

It became a scuffle,
a grappling as if trying to decide who was rider and who was horse.
//See CCD0001, but CCD1001 as well. This is sorta literal, but still has that acceptation of "trying to get along". -GHS
Why this amateur!
I beat him down.
//HACK independent CG shake,sfx -GHS
I hold back.
//He always does this... or does he? His Supah Strength is so damn chuuni that it's very possible he's no better than most anyway. -GHS
I beat him with technique, enough that there's pain, but not enough that there's injuries.
//It's a perfect beatdown, i.e., a nasty, intentional, mean-spirited one. This isn't what this should be about. It's similar to what there is between Tomoki and Misato usually than what there is between Tomoki and Taichi usually. -GHS
And while beating him, I was bored.
//HACK independent CG shake,sfx -GHS
It was a worthless two-bit play, just tedious.
//This might be a complaint on the ways so many shonen fights are written, especially considering how Taichi should, by all means, be the villain. First time the bad guy attacks means the good guy gets curb stomped. You can fast forwards through every first battle and never miss anything. Often all but the final one. And then, all that happens there is the good guy doing the exact same stuff he's done all along, but now it works Because Shut Up. -GHS
Suddenly, I notice a stare.
//HACK out -GHS

[Taichi]
"Watcha looking at."

[Sakuraba]
"Just looking."

[Taichi]
"This funny to you?"

[Sakuraba]
"Feels so adolescent."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Sakuraba]
"What is it now, best you do it as long as you feel like it. Make the level of adolescence increase more!"
//He broke them up without raising a finger, in fact, by telling Taichi to beat Tomoki down even more. Stick a halo on 'im and call him Jesus, he's done. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

We get up.

[Taichi]
"...I quit. This is just ridiculous."

[Tomoki]
"Hoy, and your job!"

'nnoying...

[Taichi]
"Yeah, yeah... I'll do it."
//...and that got him to participate. Sakuraba's truly a master at work. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...right you will. Ya should've done it in the first place."

[Taichi]
"I don'get it yannow, all this stuff 'ere. I just don't know 's all."
//first year Taichi seems to be waaay overcompensating with the male speech... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Then you can just ask!"

So this guy said, as if it was just a matter of course.
//It's not a matter of course to HIM. -GHS
His lip was split.
His face was scrunched up with pain, yet Tomoki didn't have one word of complaint.
//This might not be the right thing, however... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hoy."

[Taichi]
"What now."

[Sakuraba]
"...did your adolescence end already?"

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"I'll get to work."
//HACK to black -GHS

............
I might as well help, it's all the same after all...
//HACK different fade, doll right away -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Oh' there."

[Taichi]
"Yoh there."
//See CCA0003. Oh yes. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...what a shock."

[Taichi]
"What, yet another scoop on you?"
//See CCA0002. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"A cat has died."
//See CCC3022. And around and around it spins -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Sakuraba]
"A cat got struck by a car and died. That's not good. Not good at all."
//See also CCC3003, same kanji. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ran over then... hoy... why are you crying?"

[Sakuraba]
"...I dunno. Maybe because of the cat."

[Taichi]
"Maybe you say..."
//HACK closed eyes Sack -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Can't stop."
[Sakuraba]
"...I can't stop."

Surprisingly, he seems to be sort of naive.
But it's still within Sakuraba's peculiar standards.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK different fade -GHS
After a time, again,

[Sakuraba]
"Hoy, what a shock."

[Taichi]
"What's it this time."

[Sakuraba]
"I seem to have been made the laughingstock of the people of this school."
//He was being 'scooped' upon before, see above and CCA0002 again, but NOW he realizes this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You realize that now?"

I give him a detailed explanation with flowing eloquence.

[Taichi]
"Understand that sooner, please."
//HACK closed eyes Sack -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...do I even look like that humorous a man?"
//HACK no need -GHS

This guy might just be completely unaffected by malice, I just don't know.
Well well, then.
Some occasion or another comes and he'll just get destroyed, won't he?
I thought so at that time.
But the truth was... the exact opposite.
//NO ONE CAN STOP X-TIANS -GHS
Sakuraba may cave in and become depressed, but he had toughness so that he would experience certain resuscitation out of whatever crushing emotional defeat he suffered.
//Of course we all know what 凹 means HURR DURR DURR 精神的 mental/emotional <- once more, god kanji <=> Christianity. It's funny that this thing rates "kanji puns" on VNDB when 95% of the kanji puns are completely invisible stuff like this. -GHS
He'd be hurt for a while, then he'd do something nonsensical to cure himself.
He'd set off on some journey, or he'd dance, or he'd do a musical performance.
Within about a week he'd be mostly revived.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK different fade -GHS
And then we, someway or another, began our mate-ing.
And our Oath of the Peach Garden happened not long after that---
