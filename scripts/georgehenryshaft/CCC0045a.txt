On the way home,

[Nanaka]
"Heeey!"

Nanaka was right next to me.
As if manifested all of a sudden...
//Like Youko does. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, Nanaka..."

[Nanaka]
"In spirits?"
//I actually don't think there's a law that demands ghosts to always ask this question, but let's say it's totally gonna happen in the near future. It's forwards-compatible thinking, mine. -GHS

[Taichi]
"More importantly, that hokora---"
//HACK CG earlier -GHS

I was embraced.

[Taichi]
"N'uguh?"
//Almost-Kanon again. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"You said fun, and if you can say that, 's all right."

[Taichi]
"No, I didn't say that."

There is no chain of logical connection going through this conversation, however,
//Oddly formal -GHS
what is even with this sudden Emotionally Moving Event...
//Technical term. It's got a CG and everything! -GHS
Anyway, be that as it may.
The ambiguous softness of a breast.
The scent of a girl.
Inexplicably, I feel nothing out of order.
The feeling at the moment of embrace was so different from Youko-chan's.
//Honorific was already fixed in this script, must be a newer edit pass. There'll be a few, mostly around new text. I suspect Tanaka wrote the whole thing, copy-pasted what he had, and then fixed things haphazardly. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Those words... they make me happy. Really."

[Taichi]
"But I didn't say anything..."

[Nanaka]
"Because never becoming strong is not a disqualification from living."

[Taichi]
"Listen to what you're being told!"

[Nanaka]
"Remaining weak is... still fine."

[Taichi]
"You listening or not!"

I didn't understand any of this.

[Taichi]
"I'm really glad to have experienced the tactile feeling of your chest."
//That sounds sooo sweet if you think about it. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...too honest."
//Yeah, Taichi, don't spoil it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's just that I didn't get this at all."
//HACK wait for a second. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Sorry, I mistook you, 's all."

[Taichi]
"For what?"

Nanaka scratched her head.

[Nanaka]
"A different one."
//So if Nanaka is a memory, and therefore the error is Taichi's... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Explain in ways I can understand."

[Nanaka]
"Say you, it looks like you're setting out on helping the construction on that antenna, but how's progress?"

[Taichi]
"Listen here."

[Nanaka]
"W'at?"
//Unlistenable moe affectations. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's talk so that I can understand. First... first up is..."

[Nanaka]
"First?"

[Taichi]
"Of course, there's a lots and a lots, but..."

[Nanaka]
"Theeen one single solitary question I'll give you an answer to. Ask me anything and I'll answer, OK?"
//一個 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Co-, color of your panties?"

[Nanaka]
"Today they're white. But they're reeeally cute tho. They totally match the bra!"
//Buruma are worn OVER panties, so she's not lying. And since her talks with Taichi were all one-sided (Taichi couldn't speak as a baby), the question she's asking and the answer she's giving are all a thing of hers. That's some sexual pranking. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Pure whiiite..."

I reflect nostalgically on the girl's underwear.
//HACK normal Nanaka instead of redisplaying current doll. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Well, the questioning round is with this brought to a close."

[Taichi]
"Woooooh, dammiiiit, what about the mystery of this wooorld!!!"

I fired off a question by refleeex!

[Taichi]
"I am so stupiiid!"
//HACK closed-eyes Nanaka instead of redisplaying now-current doll -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Also perverted."

[Taichi]
"...takebacks are a nope?"
//HACK slightly serious Nanaka -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Nooo-ooope."

Nanaka crosses her arm into a X, making the Batten mark of denial and failure.
//See CCD1001, was a nickname proposal. It's also possibly a reference to the prescient diatribe Nyoro~n Churuya-san, which warned about the perils of consuming smoked cheese. Unfortunately they went unlistened, and that caused the great Smoked Collapse Event of 2007, which caused the daily intake of psychotropics in the average Japanese to effectively doubled, curiously to no apparent effect. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Next chance, 'K."

[Taichi]
"Next? But I'll have forgotten this conversation by then, won't I."

[Nanaka]
"Hoh. You have noticed then."
//法 law? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Noticed I did. But even noticing that I'm still full of stuff I dun'no, like, say, why has this all ended up like this, or what happened to humanity."
//But if this is a replay of a previous conversation, what exactly does she want him to 'notice', exactly? Given her pointing to the hokora means religion, and the hokora is full of the history of the world, what she's asking him is to notice the power of the Bible as a predictor of human behavior and history. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"As to why this all ended up like this, I don't understand it myself either."
//Understand. Not necessarily not know... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...is-, icchat so now?"
//If he's gonna talk like a baby... -GHS

Tilting my neck, I ask the question in an adorable way.

[Nanaka]
"'Cchat is so!"
//...but who was actually doing the baby talk there? This is more evidence that this is a scene replay, though whether there's something more filtered in it is harder to say. -GHS

Tilting her neck, she answered the question in an adorable way.

[Nanaka]
"Well... besides that it did get like this I can't say."
//Well, it's not like anything more happened. Or that she physically *can* tell him anything. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"I think about the reason but still I don't understand aaaanything at aaall."

[Taichi]
"Awww."

[Nanaka]
"What could you expect from a schoolgirl whose beauty would make even flowers blush!"
//Remember all those vague Nanaka half-quotes from Miki? Now Nanaka's talking flowers. Hmmm. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, first of all, that's kinda weird innit!"

[Nanaka]
"Mnuh, what is?"

[Taichi]
"Normally, roles like yours would be assigned to a much more docile Denpa-emitter of a crazy girl, definitely."
//Nanaka's role as the Mysterious Phenomenon Explainer is indeed odd... until one notices the Mysterious Phenomenon is not scientific in nature, as it'd be in your normal anime or VN, but religious. Normally, the role would be Youko's, in fact, which means when SHE explains it it has to be troll. See CCZAS when Taichi (mis)"fixes" this discrepancy by making Youko the Club President. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...huuuh?"

[Taichi]
"You're the unyielding childhood friend type, therefore, obey the matters demanded from stories suitable to be molds and live next door to me and come wake me up every day!"
//"Be like an eroge character ripoff". Ironically, Youko (the real osananajimi) does come wake him, except... but even stranger, this same term 要請事項 returns in Youko's sendback route, see CCD5001 - this unfortunately demands a sort of odd translation so the term can be consistent. See CCZDXC for more molding. -GHS

I thrust a finger at her.

[Nanaka]
"...an idiot ya are."

[Taichi]
"You're totally miscast!"
[Taichi]
"If you think you're doing something special just by making changes from the normal arrangements, you're a short-cutting imbecile!"
//VN writing criticism, consistent with CCA0023: no making simplistic changes and hoping for great twists. Tanaka takes the suggestion to heart: all the simple twists (characters that would be broken in real life are actually really broken in story) are actually not the real ones, and everything is way more complex. Such as the post-apocalyptic setting being pre-apocalyptic in the extreme, or the sci-fi setting being fantasy with religious subtext. -GHS
[Taichi]
"For that may certainly be said to be a surface-level reasoning!"
[Taichi]
"If you wanna make a change, try doing it from the grounds up. Do something that no one has ever done up until now!"

[Nanaka]
"All those words riiight back at ya."
//As said, unless one actually looks deeper, nothing in Cross Channel seems like anything deeper than a simplistic subversion of stereotypes, so the above would be hypocritical. But after all, whenever Taichi tells the truth he does so without his knowledge... -GHS

[Taichi]
"I am a short-cutting imbecile who is exclusively enthralled by superficial antithesiiiis!!!"
//See CCZDXC. Also, Tanaka just called anyone who thought this was about plot twists a moron. Condolences. -GHS

I broke down crying.

[Nanaka]
"Cry not, cry not little one."
//Mommy consoling her crying baby... as he, uhm, fails to design an eroge??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...well, if it turns like this, I pray that the next time we meet I'll ask just the same question."

[Nanaka]
"This one's already unexpectedly different, yes."

[Taichi]
"Eh, it is?"

[Nanaka]
"The other guys, their emotions are already decided on that point on Sunday night, so they take similar actions every time."
//Now that's a complete load. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"But you, Taichi, you're pretty different every time."
//But since we're discussing metaVN, this means that the protagonist changes due to the reader's choices. This, I think, is done better in YMK: the protagonist's personality is not fixed, but is determined by the choices made by the reader, and so are the girls he fall for. This continues to the religious theme: people are made by choices, the personality is not fixed by some weird thing at the beginning, even if all begin flawed in some way. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"...you never take things seriously, more like."

[Taichi]
"Naaah."

Or maybe that's true.
When I think about myself, I'm fine with there being few other people.
Therefore I don't think the way things are right now are all that bad.
If I said there was no anxiety at all that'd be lying, but...

[Taichi]
"Dunnnow."
//As said, Buruma are worn over panties so she wasn't necessarily lying. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"So."

For the present, that is the conversation.
I stare at Nanaka trying out a wheelie on her bicycle.
This person here... does not have her memories reset.
//And if she's part of Taichi's memories, then there is no memory reset at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhm, say..."

[Nanaka]
"Questions forbidden."

[Taichi]
"Guh..."

[Nanaka]
"What I say I'll do."
[Nanaka]
"It's not that I'm hiding something or the likes tho... 'K."
[Nanaka]
"...just... I'm a bit scared."

[Taichi]
"Scared?"

[Nanaka]
"Telling you everything, that's scary."
//*ears whist---* sorry, I mean, *sneeze* -GHS
[Nanaka]
"There's this feeling like it will drive you into a corner, Taichi."

The expression on her face that was cheerful now takes the shape of apprehension.

[Taichi]
"...well."

Well, a deal's a deal.

[Nanaka]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

This had become wholly gloomy.
//See CCA0003 -GHS
I decided to soften this down.

[Taichi]
"Uhm... it's not a question, but, about that underwear thing from before..."

[Nanaka]
"Hm, what?"

[Taichi]
"I would sure like for the bra to be front hook."
//Formal -GHS

Nanaka twisted her eyebrows quizzically.

[Nanaka]
"Front hook bra you say... on Nanaka-san, this schoolgirl whose beauty would make even flowers blush?"
//Now she's explaining to the baby why she has to take so long to take off her bra every time he's crying for food. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

[Nanaka]
"...reason?"
//So it'll be easier to breastfeed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So I can remove said bra when I am found Bridalnighting with a girl, what else?"

* Bridalnighting = Taichian for first-time sex.

[Taichi]
"If a front hook is present, then fingers can be inserted in the cleavage's ravine and sound out a stylish fingersnap as they undo the hook, and on that very instant, the boioingy twin hills of a mother shall be released from bondage and boioioingly..."
//母なる hahahnaru a pretty formal Mother, Mother Nature for example. More interesting: 父なる chichinaru is Father as in God the Father. This is definitely intentional. Also see CCB0002. Given what たわわ both sounds like ("tawawa") and GISes to, it's not even worth thinking of adapting to anything else. More curious considering the Self-Destruct Button prank, see CCD0008C and more, may be a derivative of exactly this primal want for her mother to hurry with the milking already. -GHS
[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Boioingly will boioiong, and---"

[Nanaka]
"Don't say it over again."
[Nanaka]
"That's not as funny a joke as you think it is inside yourself."
//And she knows exactly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"In-... in other words, because it allows the artistic appreciation of the act of swaying, indeed!"

[Nanaka]
"Veto."
//See Misato -GHS

And while we were talking about these stupid little things,
we ended up at my house.

[Taichi]
"...coming in?"

[Nanaka]
"Nuh-huh, going home."

And abruptly I thought,
where would Nanaka even go home to?
//In Heaven, DUH. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, see ya."

[Nanaka]
"Taichi!"

I was called.
I turned the head alone, laying the rear in my field of vision.
//HACK CG later (that's rare!) -GHS
Nanaka was on top of the hill.
//坂の上(top of the hill) <-> 上見坂 (Kamisaka) IOW: SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
Horribly distant,
as if she had moved in an instant.

[Nanaka]
"Taaaichi!"

Her voice carried clear and crisp in spite of being so distant, as if it had fangs that bit into my ears.
//See CCC0000. Sarcastic remark on how this has to be coincidental when, obviously, it is not. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh, ah, what?"

I lose my presence of mind.
Nanaka is, and no mistake---
//"My mother", but not yet... -GHS
Standing at the side of her bicycle, raising one hand high and higher. Holding up the sky. Smiling.

[Nanaka]
"See you next week!"

She waves the hand.

[Taichi]
"Ah, ok..."

I also asserted back,
//Multiple meanings -GHS

[Taichi]
"See you... next week."
//Given he's a baby, and he'll therefore have a sleep-eat cycle that's much faster than normal, a day would be a week to him, or thereabouts. -GHS

Nanaka rides on the bike.
Setting out to ride, the figure of the girl begins to descend into the valley between hills, and vanishes from sight.
//HACK sky instead -GHS
I never could see the figure of her climbing up on the slope on the opposite side, however long I waited---
