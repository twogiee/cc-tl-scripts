There was no nocturnal assault, then.
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
//Taichi is kidding himself if he thinks Kiri will perform a Nightbedroom Assault on him. For now. -GHS
...'cause it's my home ground, right.
//Or, given where she trains, she simply doesn't know where he lives (and doesn't have Miki to ask). That or she's home shitting her pants, waiting for Taichi to attack, but she seems to be too out of her head for that. -GHS
Not unreasonable to think there'd be traps or the sort.
I head towards school.
And,
Tomoki had died.

[Taichi]
"......"
//No reaction to blood. -GHS

The suspects had decreased,
and the victims had increased.

[Taichi]
"Tomoki..."

It was an atrocious way to die.
A thick, long, construction wire had pierced his chest.
//Unsure why the antenna'd have something like that, but sounds like the most plausible translation. The term doesn't actually seem to mean anything specific. -GHS
Coincidence... but to say that, it would have to be a case of extraordinary rarity.
//Good ol' Blessed Luck strikes again. -GHS
This thing here is... unnatural.
//That leaves the SUPERnatural. -GHS
Therefore, the culprit's---
//Miki. There's only him, her, and psycho Kiri left, so this is when he reached the (still erroneous) conclusion. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...it's... all over innit."

The world... is over.
That is the premonition I had.
Kiri is now broken, Sakuraba will likely
never return.
I have no need to live as a person, either.
...in the end, everything was useless struggling.
Crazy people can never become normal people,
because they cannot understand other people.
I thought it'd be good even without
understand of any sort.
But now---
In front of Tomoki's untalking husk, I expose
my body to an atmosphere that felt like
desolated loneliness.
//...I don't think he strips. -GHS
I don't even need to monologue.
//This is even more absurd than Sakuraba being tired of curry bread! -GHS
I am rapidly losing sight of all the words I
could use to talk of myself.
Where is Kiri?
She's not on school premises then?
She shouldn't be at her house either.
Wandering. That's all this is.
Kiri...
No, anyone would be fine...
Right. Senpai.
That's something that has always existed on the rooftop.
//Subtly off. -GHS
Not here.
The fence was broken.
//This is easily meta-explained: it's a replay of Yutaka's death. Tomoki... dunno, maybe he remembers that he destroys the antenna, and at this point he's just tossing 'em out of the Settei. -GHS
Senpai had died.
When people fall they make a pink-colored flower.
//She would've died between Taichi coming to school and him reaching the rooftop, since the break in the fence seems to be towards the front of the school. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"
//No reaction to blood. Oh, he's snapped; his friends are dying one by one and there's a classic tsundere who's crossed the wrong 'dere' barrier on his back. Except THIS is how he goes crazy. -GHS

Ahhh.
Blood smells sweet.
I just never understand that very well.
Ohhh, really, seriously.
To what point have I even been struggling... up to now?
//He seems to be realizing he doesn't have a problem with blood, rather than being driven crazy by it again. -GHS
Restrain yourself now.
And then,
dodge.
A bolt passes by.
Kiri.
She was among us.
She was among uuus!♪
//Happy, because maybe she can kill him. Provided he doesn't just give in. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...murderer!

Kiri flips over a red cylinder.
It's a desire extinguisher, I think.
//That actually reads "digestive organs", correct is 消火器. This is unfixed in all versions. That's not an uncommon typo for fire extinguisher, here's a page with it: http://www.dousan.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=4030 Given how many typos have been fixed, I must suspect this is intentional; maybe Taichi's really going mad. -GHS
White smoke.

[Taichi]
"...ngh!"

Field of vision clouds over.
...I had gotten used to this, haven't I.
//It may just means he got used to the fog, but, hum, I guess that pun says it all. Still, interesting he'd be used to a cloudy worldview; perhaps his near-blindness is more evidenced than I thought. -GHS
Kiri's presence...
I leaped at it,
I grab her wrist:
it's clasping something bladed.
I use a strong grip.

[Kiri]
"Nggh!"

Kiri doesn't let it go.
A naked exhibition of beastlike hatred.
//This now mirrors the Miki/Taichi dance, see CCC4015. -GHS
Further strength.

[Kiri]
"Nh, nggggh!"

There ought be pain,
in these thin wrists.
They would snap so easily.
//And yet he doesn't snap them. -GHS
But she doesn't let it go.
Ahhh,
it's because she saw Tomoki's husk, is it.
Even if I wasn't the one who did him in.
Within this rubbing and jostling back and forth, I came to want her.
//揉 as used in his scuffles with Tomoki. NO NOT THE WANTING AGGGH YOU DAMN FUJOSHIS-GHS
Kiri.
My stupid, yet adorable Kiri.
I take her lips.
//He wants to kill her so bad that he kisses her. This kind of stuff is just part of the seduction game for him. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Nh, NNNNNNNNH?!"

[Taichi]
"...!"

My tongue's bitten.
//It was... the tongue of the fatman. -GHS
There is no damage.
Thinking becomes clear.

[Taichi]
"...Kiri... I am the culprit."
//Of killing Yutaka... no, not even that. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Nnngh, too late!!!"

There is no sign of trembling in the hand holding the knife.

[Taichi]
"Not of that."

[Kiri]
"...the hell, a-ha-ha."

Mockery.
+ tears.
Kiri's feelings are now completely wrecked.
//And that "+ tears" was toootally sane. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hands off Miki."

[Taichi]
"It's Miki."
[Taichi]
"The culprit is Miki."

Kiri stopped.
//The arrow comes a moment later. She already knows. -GHS
To stop her as she has become, there is likely this one key, no other.
The wind is sliced.
//This may be part of the reading key for why 'wind' is actually 'the bluff between people', as well as the noise between them. Alas. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Gwah...?"

A weird voice escapes from the bottom of her lungs,
that is how I knew it was a fatal wound.
At the same time, I could feel agonizing pain in the thigh.
It's a bolt.
It perforated Kiri's thin chest and passed through my femoral area.
//I don't get the positions here. *considers grabbing some dolls to test things out* *doesn't have dolls* *hahahah, kidding, of course he does* *tries for three seconds* *spends an hour putting them in sexual poses* "The results of my extensive research are yet inconclusive." -GHS
I lifted up my head,

[Taichi]
"...I knew it."
//That she knows he'd figure it out is probably the major reason she's here; if she doesn't bring him down now, he'll hunt her down and possibly kill her before she has time to explain, and even if she did, he might not really care. Although, there's always Tower of Friends, where Miki is also in love. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ahahah, this is the first time I've managed to bring you down, Senpai."

So innocently.

[Taichi]
"......"

[Kiri]
"...uh... what...? Miki?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

Her knife falls away.
She tries to sit up... failure.

[Taichi]
"OW!"

[Kiri]
"...I... was I shot?"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

[Kiri]
"By who?"

[Taichi]
"....."

[Kiri]
"Lies... khaf!"

Blood spills from the mouth as well.
//No reaction from Taichi. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, hurtsh... Miki... Mi..."

Miki gazes fixed at Kiri's final dying agony.
All sentiments, without exceptions, impossible to read.

[Taichi]
"To do something that stupid... friends, weren't you friends?"
//He's more concerned about her just staring rather than her having put down what currently amounts to a rabid animal. -GHS

[Miki]
"......"

Kiri coughs, violently. A large amount of blood.

[Taichi]
"Tell me who you are."

[Miki]
"I am Miki."

[Taichi]
"No you aren't. Miki isn't this tough."

[Miki]
"...I have been forged and disciplined! By all of you, Senpai."
//She could mean all Taichis, but since everyone but Kiri is her senpai, that's sort of irrelevant. Regardless, I'm not adding an 's' to Senpai because science's. -GHS

This gal...
//(Hum, Ssenpai? Senpsai? Senpasi? Ah, Sesnpai (pronounced Sexenpai).) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"Miki... where? Are you behind me? I can't turn around..."

Every time Kiri stirs, a sharp pain runs through my leg.
And that is how,
I was able to gain my rationality back.
//So the above is half-chuuni at best. If at all. Of course pain makes him rational... he's only masochist up to a point. -GHS

[Kiri]
"You're not Miki are you? You shot me... no, you didn't, right?"

[Miki]
"Yes I did. It was me!"

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"
[Kiri]
"...you lie."

[Taichi]
"Kiri."

She looks up at me.
With her chest pierced through, she could do nothing but that.

[Kiri]
"...inno... cent?"

[Taichi]
"Not exactly. But I didn't kill anyone. I didn't want to kill!"

[Kiri]
"......"
[Kiri]
"...apo... lo..."
//Kiri's quick on the uptake, but only when she has something to ground her deductions. Otherwise, she just spins in a circle, deducing idiocy after idiocy. That's how she's quick to accept Yutaka was a rapist and Miki's the bad guy: she already knew, in a sense. -GHS

Without letting her finish her words of apology,
//This is important considering how difficult it is for Kiri to apologize. He doesn't really want to even hear it; but whether he doesn't accept it, or is satisfied with unexpressed repentance, is at this point intentionally unclear. -GHS
I, gently, placed my fingers around her carotid artery.
//Miki and Taichi kill Kiri, she doesn't die of coincidence, otherwise, Miki managing to shoot down Youko would be the same... yes, there's still the possibility it wasn't a trap at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sleep. It's a dream. When you wake up, it'll be the normal everyday of always."

There is contradiction in those words, yet Kiri laughed.
//There isn't. They both know. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ahah..."

I lightly tighten. That is plenty.
//She survived a stone to the calf and shoulder without serious injuries, and Taichi couldn't disarm her. Her fragility is simply inconsistent. Works better if he's just making her pass out. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ah........."

Gently... killed.

[Miki]
"...!"

[Taichi]
"Ow..."

I yank the bolt out of her shell as well.
The thigh wound is shallow,
but I still don't have the strength to move anymore.

[Taichi]
"...you gonna kill me too?"

[Miki]
"You gave it to her? The finishing blow?"
//She's standing right in front of her. She can see this perfectly. He could've seen him strangle her. She knows he's not killing anyone. That's why she's gotta ask. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Miki]
"Nice guy, Senpai."
//See CCA0009A -GHS

[Taichi]
"You gonna kill me too?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"The reason?"

[Miki]
"...do you want to know it?"
[Miki]
"But you had gone rampant, Senpai, so I thought you had lost your rationality."
//Well, rampant is sort of a fancier word for rampage, so even if my deduction is wrong, it still works. More interesting how Miki seems to think Taichi's gone on a rampage. But he hasn't at all! Unless, of course, Taichi "going rampant" simply means that he start seeing dead bodies left and right, with the rest of the club more or less playing along. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh, you know about me then."

[Miki]
"And also about Hasekura-senpai."

[Taichi]
"...why did you kill everybody?"

[Miki]
"I didn't kill. I didn't."
//She just shot Kiri to de-facto death. It's kind of in-your-face. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then who killed them?"

[Miki]
"Coincidence."
//And what a Providential coincidence this is! -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Miki, don't joke around. We're talking serious here."

[Miki]
"But it's true. It was coincidence. I call it the Invisible Hand."
//Wikipedia: "In general, the term "invisible hand" can apply to any individual action that has unplanned, unintended consequences, particularly those that arise from actions not orchestrated by a central command, and that have an observable, patterned effect on the community." Very interesting she'd use an economic anti-centralist term, though the invisible hand here should recall more God's intervention than anything else. After all, the greatest coincidence here is how Miki is finally unmasked as being unreset... twice so, should no reset ever take place. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Invisible hand?"

[Miki]
"Occasionally, there's the possibility that this kind of thing happens."
//The point isn't "shit happens", either, though that's a better takeaway than the entire philosophical systems of most stories out there. -GHS
[Miki]
"The beginning was... Hasekura-senpai was it? This is the first time that person has died, however."
//This hesitation should indicate she's not quite sure about her death. -GHS
[Miki]
"I was the one that placed the traps, however this is the first time she has died."

[Taichi]
"...those traps were yours, then, Miki."

[Miki]
"Yes. You taught me, Senpai."
//Taichi teaches lots of stuff to Miki. Are these traps nothing more but further sophistry? -GHS

[Taichi]
"I taught you nothing!"

[Miki]
"It was long ago. Several dozens of weeks ago or more."
[Miki]
"I don't want anyone to get close to that place, so I must be vigilant. The real objective is for me to be able to detect anyone approaching and... with traps one has to move slowly and carefully. That gives me time to escape."
//In other words, she doesn't expect anyone but Taichi or Youko to go there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...'place'?"

[Miki]
"There, and only there, is exempt from the loop."
//The only overtly religious symbol in the entire story (that people will notice at least) is exempt from the loop. How the fairy tale of the two do people not notice I'll never ever know. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Loop..."

[Miki]
"The world has been doing this one week over and over many times, Senpai."

And then Miki spoke,
of this single week from Monday through to Sunday,
and of how the world that had progressed until then returns again to the state it was on Monday.
Loop.
That is what Miki called it.

[Taichi]
"This story's tough to believe."
//No shit. -GHS

[Miki]
"There's no point to lying, is there?"
//Hahahahah, and we've only just started. -GHS
[Miki]
"Recollections and personal status, as well, all goes to where it was at the origin."
[Miki]
"Therefore, even Kiri-chin over there, once it becomes next week, will be revived."
[Miki]
"Of course, once Monday comes back, I don't think she'll have recollection of being killed."
//"I don't think"? Even not reading that kanji literally, and going with something like "it doesn't seem", that's a very very strange qualifier to use for someone who's been through this an uncountable number of times. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If that's the truth, then how come you are aware of all this, Miki?"

[Miki]
"Because the hokora, and only it, is exempt from the passage of time."
//Note the wording. Not just exempt from the loop; exempt from the PASSAGE OF TIME. The only religious symbol in the story is both cut off from its rules as well as eternal. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...in other words... you are living in the hokora?"
//Note his response isn't "how the hell is that even possible???" The hokora is never questioned. -GHS

[Miki]
"But only for the moment where Sunday ends."

[Taichi]
"...so, if this loop thing's all real, why did you kill everybody?"

[Miki]
"Because the idea of my death is absolutely unacceptable."
//Contrast CCC4015. He just asked her the same question twice, and NOW she doesn't deny it. Bad liar, Miki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The two sentences don't flow together."

[Miki]
"...the first time I noticed about the hokora, there were already notebooks inside it."
//Meaning she was 1) roaming around the countryside, alone 2) she noticed the hokora 3) decided to open it for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Of course it's still the Invisible Hand of Coincidence... or maybe it's just she saw Taichi, Youko or something else. Remember, there's no loop and no Cross World, so it's just her cheating at his game. More interesting that given the Youko route and her Sendback, Miki without experience goes hikikomori really really fast. That she'd be out in the countryside exploring is very suspicious. -GHS
[Miki]
"In the notebooks, a daily life was diarized in detail up to Saturday, and the writer was you, Senpai."
//HE doesn't notice his own handwriting, remember CCC0007, only his style. How did she recognize it? By the same, perhaps... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Me...?"

[Miki]
"Even if this loop phenomenon resets your memories every time, Senpai, you and Hasekura-senpai have a fairly high probability of figuring out the truth of things."
[Miki]
"But because you forget, you save the records in the hokora in diary form... well, I think you do that to make it easier for yourselves to grasp the situation in the following week."
//BTW: diary = backlog -GHS
[Miki]
"But you never noticed how, if you stay inside the hokora, the eigentime is preserved."
[Miki]
"But it seems like that, for Hasekura-senpai, the protection of her eigenself doesn't have much meaning in the first place..."
//She just mentioned the two haven't noticed this - or has Taichi alone not noticed? Not that it matters since there's no loop, but it's interesting to see Miki claim Youko thinks his eigenself is as worthless as Taichi's - and will be so juuust right around when Taichi also begins to find worth in his eigenself. The point is, Youko isn't meant to be unreset yet. -GHS
[Miki]
"Well, it's because that person is also not really normal."
[Miki]
"Anyway... when it becomes next week, everybody's recollections get cleared."
//Rejoins here. BTW: it's all true in the meta-VN sense. It's other senses that will be blatant lies. -GHS
[Miki]
"But isn't that the same as dying and being reborn?"
[Miki]
"However many diaries you write, all those hours up until we are reset are not fully reintegrated, you know?"
[Miki]
"Isn't it just dying, ever single time?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"I find that unacceptable."
[Miki]
"I want to live with the same connection to the unique human that I am now, forever."
[Miki]
"The world might be advancing just this little but... I don't want to repeat myself without being aware."
//Remembering how Higurashi had people's cross-dimension memories as nothing but unspecified Settei, though Umineko redefines this in a certain metasense, I'm once more reminded that Ryukishi doesn't seem to have understood what this part actually means, religiously speaking. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I get your feelings but... what of that made you kill everyone?"

[Miki]
"I told you, it was just coincidence, it was."
//That is still not connected. Why did she answer the question with all of that? -GHS
[Miki]
"If there's continuous repeats, then there's the possibility that Hasekura-senpai randomly gets caught by a trap, isn't there?"
//Not technically. A hundred perfectly identical coin tosses will result in a hundred perfectly identical results. The only way this can't be so is if this world isn't repeating perfectly, or if there's something else interfering with this - which may well be the same thing, giving both lead back to the hokora. Without it, the loop is simply indiscoverable. The only religious building in the story allows even the concept of possibility to exist in what should be a perfectly fixed, completely scripted, pre-decided world. This hints strongly at a supernatural and religious interpretation of the story. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Around once in a hundred times, yes."
//Interesting Taichi he admits Youko is less than one hundred percent. We must always be seeing her 1%, then. Or maybe she has the Detective Authority, except when the author forgets she doesn't and up and decides some things are 100% even when it's been repeatedly stated without DA they are not. -GHS

[Miki]
"Then, randomly, Touko-senpai might die, Shima-senpai might die, Mimi-senpai might die... all those can happen!"
//Regardless of the impossibility of possibilities in a world that should be perfectly fixed, this is why trying to 'fix' everything by making a perfect world by attempting to wield what boils down to the ultimate power doesn't work. The power of the loop is the One Ring of Cross Channel. It can only be destroyed. (Yes, the loop is the ring. So blatant! So damn blatant!) -GHS
[Miki]
"That is what happened this time."
//The odds of all these coincidences happening perfectly in order for things to go exactly like this are beyond astronomical. Well, we have a hokora that speaks of religion, and we'll have MWI as a (bunked) explanation; no problem bringing in the Anthropic Principle. And that still points to God being, if not cause, certainly influence of all this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The culprit... aside from the traps that caught the first one... was coincidence?"
//No mention of Kiri. Oh, and just wait: remember that the Hasekura massacre involved traps. That apparently did nothing at all, see CCD0022A. -GHS

[Miki]
"Coincidence, occasionally, becomes an invisible murderer."
//So it better ties with the route title. So if coincidence is the invisible murderer, what causes the invisible tears and were are they? Those are simple: they are Taichi's (and Miki's) lamentations for their fallen. Specifically Taichi's: if most of the deaths in the VN are just him replaying the Hasekura and/or Yutaka's death over and over, and regretting it over and over, then the deaths we see are his tears for the people he killed or otherwise led to die. -GHS
[Miki]
"In the Loop World, this 'occasionally' is more of a determined event."
//That's a direct contradiction! If this is a loop, then there is no "occasionally" period, not unless there is some sort of external element of disturbance that makes the loop nothing of the sort. As there are, this becomes a direct statement that there can be no loop at all. -GHS

Miki has dropped a Monkey-and-Typewriter-and-Shakespeare affirmation in here.
//Hey, remember when Ryukishi had the Umineko version of the protagonist from Higurashi claim that Higurashi was de-facto solved like this? -GHS

[Taichi]
"But Touko's been stabbed, wasn't she?"

[Miki]
"I did that."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Miki]
"Touko-senpai has a high likelihood of starving to death every time."
[Miki]
"And, as she was already dead on this time, I stabbed her cadaver with a dagger."
//See CCA4010. Little problem: she bled. Plenty. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The reason?"

[Miki]
"...to flip Kiri-chin's switch."
//See CCC4014: Taichi's wasn't flipped. The question of whether he even can isn't quite as easily answered as it seems. -GHS
[Miki]
"To make Kiri-chin try to kill you, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"...Miki..."

[Miki]
"Ah, I don't dislike you, Senpai, you know?"
[Miki]
"Just... it's because you are dangerous."
[Miki]
"Don't you have also a high probability of going rampant?"
[Miki]
"When you see blood, don't you often become odd?"
//Like he did all the time this route! Oh, wait... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...yup."

[Miki]
"All until now was to somehow manage this, and to attempt to stabilize things."

[Taichi]
"...hahah, you've been babysitting me then!"

[Miki]
"Yes!♪"
[Miki]
"Because I really like you when you're nice, Senpai."
//See CCA0009A, CCZAS -GHS

Emotion took dwelling in her for one instant.

[Miki]
"...but, this time we had the irregular complication of Hasekura-senpai's death."

She returns expressionless.

[Miki]
"That person is practically superhuman, so she often discovers my camp."

[Taichi]
"You have a camp, you mean next to the hokora?"
//Minor oddity here: if the camp's next to the hokora, since its area of influence isn't small, then the camp should be preserved; if so, she should know she can stay unreset outside the hokora. And yet, she's been living within it...? Minor oddity, as said. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes. I borrowed it from the training camp's equipment... ah, don't move, please."

[Taichi]
"I wanna stop the bleeding..."

[Miki]
"Apologies... that's something I can't allow..."

[Taichi]
"Because you'll kill me?"

[Miki]
"...yes."

Despondently.

[Taichi]
"...sigh... why even, because if that thing you said's true then I'll just be reborn again."

[Miki]
"When Hasekura-senpai discovers me, I immediately surrender. I just provide information."
//This doesn't really segue. -GHS
[Miki]
"Because whatever I do, I could never beat her, you know."

[Taichi]
"That's a really strenuous self-preservation."

[Miki]
"How you'd react in case of Hasekura-senpai being no more was something unknown."
[Miki]
"...Kiri-chin can also end up being neurotically malicious, did you see how she just snapped in the blink of an eye?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, indeed."

[Miki]
"I cannot die."
[Miki]
"As those words say... I am very important to myself, very much."
//"Living by faith includes the call to something greater than cowardly self-preservation" -JRR Tolkien -GHS
[Miki]
"More than anyone."

[Taichi]
"......I see."
[Taichi]
"That is your Ultramarine."
//Absolutely false, of course, her Ultramarine is her imitative behavior and her almost-pathological lying, to start with. Her taking everything so damn seriously is closer to it. That's why even if her sacrifice at the end of the route is false (no reset, ever), it's still credibly a sacrifice: she gives up trying to control Taichi and his world, as well as all her pretense of having grown up at all. In short, she gives up her role as the Villain of the setting. -GHS

[Miki]
"...yes, turns out it is."
[Miki]
"I just don't get people's pain or anything of the sort at all, so,"
[Miki]
"I'm just something that lives on pretending to be a person."
[Miki]
"Those are the words that Kiri-chin sometimes uses when she wants to torment you, Senpai."
//And they are wrong applied to Taichi. Or rather, they apply to everyone. Because the more one pretends to be a person... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...but I don't remember them?"

[Miki]
"Ah, when things have unfolded that way, of course."
//See CCC3009. She was looking then... and likely as well when they had sex. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, it was to a me before the reset, you mean."

[Miki]
"Senpai, you're not camouflaging."
[Miki]
"You're just... trying to be a human."
[Miki]
"And, the one who was really a camouflaged parasite... was me."

[Taichi]
"...it a problem if you were to just always hide yourself in the hokora?"

[Miki]
"...I could do that, but..."
[Miki]
"I would just lose my mind from boredom, wouldn't I?"
//Same reason why Taichi doesn't stay at home. With the oddity that Youko, this week, comes to wake him up to make sure he leaves home. Sure, he's his URMOMS, but that's still quite odd. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... right..."

[Miki]
"Preserving everyone in a suitable state of mind, negotiating with Hasekura-senpai, paying attention... those are all the things that I endlessly repeat."
//One Loop to rule them all, One Loop to find them, One Loop to bring them all and in the darkness bind them/ in the land of Hasugatake where the Nuclear Plant lies (* one of these parts is highly suspect) -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's some trouble."

[Miki]
"But, while I'm doing all that, I must be the normal innocent myself... playing the fool with Senpai... doing club activities with everyone..."

[Taichi]
"...when you are in the hokora, your subjective time is preserved, but... won't you become an adult someday, Miki, and what then?"

[Miki]
"...I don't think about that."
[Miki]
"Someday will come when it'll be impossible, that I'll just have to take a reset, but..."
[Miki]
"That's already... because I, as I am now, am already a different person..."
//Ah, now we get to the real point of attrition of resetting vs. not resetting (though it's still not in the deepest reading). You stop being yourself whether you become someone else during sleep or not. Merely adding information is change. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Scared?"

[Miki]
"Scared."
[Miki]
"That my self would disappear... it's scary."
//See CCC3030. She was there, likely unreset, at the moment of reset. And now she's tossing his words back at him. This is suspect beyond belief. -GHS

Tears flow out.

[Miki]
"Vanishing from this world where there is no one makes me scared."
//Loss of eigenself is what she means with disappearance even in her Sendback. But growth is also a loss of the eigenself! So she changes whether she resets or not. There's no need for reset regardless. -GHS
[Miki]
"...but."
[Miki]
"For some reason, I feel a sort of solitude."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"As if somehow it was all hollow."

Miki lowers her weapon.

[Miki]
"And by talking to you now, Senpai, it's all become even more hollow."

[Taichi]
"Yeah. 'Cause that was one Headmaster Class of a long talk."

[Miki]
"...you're not afraid at all."

[Taichi]
"It was a really interesting chat."

[Miki]
"...ahahah... of course, you're a much more amazing person than me, Senpai."
//See CCA0017A. Completely different words, yet... -GHS

[Taichi]
"But Youko-chan, to say, she's way something else."

[Miki]
"That person's... she's something close to completeness, yet... she's just not a congruous human in the literal sense of the word, isn't she?"
//This is what Taichi thinks. She's still tossing his words back at him. She might not even quite understand them. -GHS
[Miki]
"You're different."
[Miki]
"You're the same as me, and even if you have it far worse than I, you make many times my effort."
[Miki]
"You never give up."

She draws near.

[Miki]
"Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"The very first person that I... fell in love with, was you."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, whatt'an honor."

I close my eyes,
to be easy to kill.
And then,

[Miki]
"...farewell, see you next week."
//These were Taichi's last words at the address in the Kiri route. Ever and ever more suspicious. -GHS

[Taichi]
"See you next week."

I shut down my consciousness.
//Electrical burst. Get it? Because he's a robot... or rather an android. Perhaps a Battleroid... -GHS
