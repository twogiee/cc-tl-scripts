[Misato]
"Ah..."

Time to bring Senpai's lower extremities to the light (this time without ulterior motives).
In... the part that is bleeding... I saw toothmarks.
//Still "The Wolf" Kurosu Taichi. Wait, wasn't the Wolf Touko? -GHS
All around the mouth of the wound where a tiny amount of blood was creating a thinly spreading red moisture.
//He tried to suck *off* the blood. Something to keep in mind. -GHS
It looks as if someone or something wanted to bite off the mouth of that wound.
//The 'a someone' of CCA0016 -GHS
No.
What else could it even look like...

[Taichi]
"...Senpai?"

[Misato]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"...did you... despise...?"

[Misato]
"Despise?"

[Taichi]
"It's,"

Language that doesn't become words.
How should I even explain acts and feelings that I cannot translate well, not even to myself?

[Taichi]
"I mean,"

Senpai puffs into a smile.

[Misato]
"You did nothing that is worthy of despise, you did not."

[Taichi]
"...I... did not?"

But...
I look at the cut.
Senpai quietly covers it with the skirt.

[Misato]
"You are a well-behaved kid, so I shall overlooking all that."
//Translation: "nice doggy, I'll pretend you didn't shit on the carpet". -GHS
[Misato]
"And you have been helping with club activities."

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Please allow me to care for that."

[Misato]
"...yes."

And then I gave medical care to Senpai.
This time, no seizure occurred.
//Same term used in CCA0004 -GHS
Because I was happy.
//UNHAPPINESS CAUSES HIS SEIZURES. Not blood. -GHS
Because... that high-ranking emotion was there.

[Misato]
"That tickleees!"

[Taichi]
"I, I am sorry... nervousness."

[Misato]
"You are crap at making bandages are you."
//Slangy. Notice the old bandages aren't described as crap, so it's far from impossible the actual nurse did them. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I am inexperienced..."

[Misato]
"It-, it tickleee〜s!!!"

[Taichi]
"Nggg〜h..."

That hours of this blessed happiness,
would even exist---

[Taichi]
"Ah!"
[Taichi]
"Yes?"

[Misato]
"My cellphone, where is it?"

[Taichi]
"Your cellphone...?"

Sudden everyday words.
It paralyzed thoughts.

[Misato]
"It seems I have dropped it."

She makes a horribly worried face.

[Taichi]
"I will go look. It has to be on the rooftop."

[Misato]
"Please do..."
//A liiittle desperate. -GHS

I left the infirmary and headed towards the rooftop.
I found the cellphone right away.
It had fallen down when the pile of materials fell.

[Taichi]
"Why the cellphone, even."

A trifling question.

[Taichi]
"Nah."

I immediately drown it out.
Anybody would have something they rely on.
Just like what I do, so Senpai might just be entrusting something great to this tiny little portable telephone.

[Taichi]
"Here it is!"

[Misato]
"Ahhh, it is!"

Senpai accepts it, smiling broadly.

[Misato]
"I very much appreciate it. With this, your debt is forgiven."

[Taichi]
"Eh...?"

My face distorted, without even fully smiling,
as if I had just heard a bad joke.

[Taichi]
"That is... really a quick forgiveness there."
//Another typo fixed. Although not as bad as the Miki route, there's at least three-four 'round this route alone. -GHS

[Misato]
"I am an Ultramarine of Gunjou myself."
//First read it should be ambiguous as to what it means, exactly, to have an 'ultramarine'. -GHS
[Misato]
"And so, will you be doing that again?"

[Taichi]
"...I do not know. There is the possibility."
[Taichi]
"Because it is something like a seizure."

[Misato]
"Then there is room for leniency given the extenuating circumstances."

[Taichi]
"...naive."

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Mimi-senpai, you're naive."
[Taichi]
"I ain't some harmless younger man."
//Suddenly rude. This actually works pretty well with his lapses into 'boku'. -GHS

[Misato]
"But when I told you to stop, you did stop."
//Whether the dialogue was there or not is unknown. -GHS

Did I now?
But I expect I wouldn't have been able to interpret language.
Coincidence?
//See Miki route. Yes, and my ass both. -GHS
That is what I decide it is.
But... was it?

[Taichi]
"Getting close to you like this, Senpai, may just be wrong... because, after all,"
//"...you know I'm the Incredible Hulk, so I gotta move to the next town *cue theme*". -GHS

Words interrupt.
A quiet, still summer.
Excessively quiet, that even the signs of club activities and classes disappear.
//COUGH COUGH COUGH COOOOOOUGH. -GHS
A white infirmary ruled by peace and quiet.
As the world was being filled by the dusk, the interior of the room with its white color as foundation would've subordinate it without a struggle, and offered to the twilight the two foreign elements held in it like would a womb, as scapegoats.
//Translation: "duuude we're getting colored orange due to the twilight!" This is still Taichi reflexively jumping into verbiagism as he can't handle the situation. Nice little scapegoating there, however. -GHS
The color of evening leaves an impression stronger than any other time of a day.
//Kana Little Sister: "I walk in the sunset at Kana's pace. A slow pace. The orange glow of our surroundings feels like a different world." -GHS
Everything changes into a parallel world, a thing of hair-raising eeriness.
//Yes, that's the term. Dusk = parallel world. -GHS
These are the hours of annihilation.
//Term often found to describe what happened to humanity. It's all but screamed. -GHS
Hours when the world can be seen in multiplex.
After it has sunk, who can possibly ascertain whether the sun that in the next day again comes full of nonchalance on its face is identical to the one of yesterday?
//This used to have "sun" written with the wrong kanji. -GHS
What if every day, one piece at a time, the world perishes and passes away.
//Cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooough, he gasped. -GHS
What if it is reborn along with the next day, and humans alone remain unaware.
There are no means to make sure.
Nowhere there is proof that the world of reality and the world that humans are aware of are one and the same.
//Still true because Heaven(tm). -GHS
And yet, right now, the small expanse of this ordinary infirmary alone appeared to be exempt from the invasion of brilliant scarlet.
//That's in direct contradiction with the above. -GHS
Because, unusually, I had seen the world so clearly.
//Should have something to do with his night eyes. Or the fact that it's currently like 9AM, so the orange isn't the growing twilight, it's the morning. -GHS

[Misato]
"...a perfect human does not exist anywhere, am I right?"
//See CCB1001B -GHS
[Misato]
"Everybody is strange in some ways, am I right?"
[Misato]
"Attacking every single fault and mistake one by one is not the way to live."
[Misato]
"Well? Do you agree?"

[Taichi]
"..."

If I shed but a single tear, I'll look as cool as a tool.
//He'd be unhip all the way to the hip. So uncool it heats up the room. -GHS
Inexplicably, the extreme emotions have fallen silent.
//Because of the purple above, see CCC3025. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...when I was alone, and then you invited me to club, I... respect you so much for that."

Speaking in halting fragments,
Senpai watching over me,
//見守 ｖｓ　見里... but the name had been changed, so I don't think the pun's intended. -GHS
while hours abate in the quiet.

[Taichi]
"I don't want to be disliked, so I don't want to hurt anyone either."
//And he's learned his lesson, soon to forget it. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...I think that what I did right then is unforgivable."
[Taichi]
"But I have no self-confidence in my self-control."

[Misato]
"So what can we do?"
//See CCB1001B. Ouch. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Misato]
"First of all, what is there to be careful about? As for myself, I mean."

[Taichi]
"...well."

If I think with composure,

[Taichi]
"If I make sure not to see your blood, Senpai..."

[Misato]
"So I should be careful not to get hurt?"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

[Misato]
"But I am putting the antenna together, and using tools, so I really face the risk of injuries."

[Taichi]
"Yes, therefore, me not being near you..."

[Misato]
"But, Peke-kun..."
//awww she really wuves him. -GHS

Interjected, this she said:

[Misato]
"Would you help me with the heavy lifting?"

[Taichi]
"........."

That worked.
//Misato uses SWEET TALK! It is super effective. -GHS
Gradually, the depth enclosed by the ribs of my cage were made to quiver.
//...aqua splash? -GHS
             『You are always alone, are you.』
        『Will you not have club together with me?』
Those words had been added, as one quote, in the anthology deep inside my heart.
//He has an internal Book of Proverbs (though that's not the term). -GHS
Overwhelmingly warm, overwhelmingly soft, overwhelmingly strong.
//Repetition would work well here, too bad it only exists in Japanese as emphasis. -GHS
When I have worry that I cannot resolve alone, a single solitary word from another erases it.
I believed that people desire reciprocal communication is for the sake of that.
With words, with the body, with cellphones.
...with intercommunication.
In every single way, with all possible means.
A desire for reciprocal touch accomplished through great effort:
that is a Person.

[Misato]
"I knew it, I ended up needing to ask for help for the assembly."

[Taichi]
"...yes ma'am."

I feel ashamed.
Senpai smiles bright, looking like she's enjoying herself.
Youko-chan said that I make for a very strong human being.
//Odd -san honorific changed to usual -chan in the console version, so it was another error. -GHS
But I don't like the way she recognizes that value.
//Youko wouldn't see being human/a person as a positive. -GHS
It's wrong.
Humans outside of me are so often amazing.
Any time anywhere Mimi-senpai can make me feel pleasant and lead me by the nose and captivate me.
That is something... that cannot be done on one's own.
I want to be beside her,
until the day that time allows,
until the day that is the end,
and even then, there will be time.
//Life After Death. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It will be my pleasure."

[Misato]
"Hmmm."

With a bow of her head,
Senpai makes her hands fall together with a pof,
awkwardly,
eventually smiling,
and with that, she is as she was.
I was so happy I felt tears coming.
Senpai's hands open the curtains.
In one instant the infirmary was devoured by the orange.
