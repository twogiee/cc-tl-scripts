I came to the cafeteria.
Sakuraba was eating curry bread.
This guy's simple. Easy-peasy.
I should just secure the suspect until that point in time on Sunday.
//身柄を押さえる is the police term for "put into custody". See CCD5001. And later on... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sakurabaaa."

[Sakuraba]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"On Sunday morning, rendez-vous at my house."

[Sakuraba]
"Got that. Leave it to me."

I can't give him my trust. Of course.
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
I am awake.
Sunlight was piercing through the window.
Seems I have been hard asleep. I did not have any dreams.
The time is... 7AM.
Going to school is necessity.

[Sakuraba]
"Yo."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I handed him a surgical mask.

[Sakuraba]
"O.K."

He put it on, not one doubt or question.

[Sakuraba]
"Hungry."

[Taichi]
"Haven't eaten then?"

[Sakuraba]
"Readying for first period class."

[Taichi]
"...is the subject curry bread perhaps?"

[Sakuraba]
"Until that day when curry bread itself has finally passed."

Cooly resolved.
Just as in the records.
//Hmmm, this is the same as the sentence two below, but this was slightly different in CCD0012. I suspect, as usual, older revision - but it may be haste in copypasta. Following original script. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't you like to eat some retort pouch curry too?"

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."

Just as recorded.
The records are, more and more, steadily being fulfilled.

[Sakuraba]
"Heh-cks!"
//HACK independent doll shake (though the PS2 version has BG at this point for whatever reason, it differs from CCD0012 too) -GHS

[Taichi]
"...whew, there it goes, the Tragedy of the Hexagon."

So it had been recorded.
Rate of occurrence, up to present, has been just confirmed to be 15% or more.
//Still likely older scripts. This has a comma missing that doesn't change much. -GHS
My calculations say that once in seven times I will be struck with a Nasal Discharge Bridge.
However, a celebrated personage of the past (I) has worked out the technique of avoidance of such via installation of a mask, indeed.
//Ibid. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...is it OK if I take off the mask?"

[Taichi]
"That cannot be allowed."

[Sakuraba]
"So harsh... this human life."

[Taichi]
"Indeed that is true."
[Taichi]
"Well, I'll be going home now."

[Sakuraba]
"...right."

[Taichi]
"Rendez-vous at my house on Sunday morning, got that!"

[Sakuraba]
"Roger. We're OK."

Yeah, because I can trust you.
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS
Wednesday.
To school.
A gate to prevent desertion.
It seems to exist less to protect students, and more to protect the outside world from us.
That is the impression it left.

[Taichi]
"Here again?"

[Sakuraba]
"...got tired of it."

[Taichi]
"'course you did."
[Taichi]
"Let me tell ya one thing, you apathetic lassitude-filled bastard."
[Taichi]
"Don't you up and decide to go on a trip or something!"

[Sakuraba]
"Got that."

[Taichi]
"Get my permission first."

[Sakuraba]
"Got that."
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"That agreement's so quick that it makes me uneasy! Are you even listening?!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"It's alright. If I get your permission it's OK, right?"

[Taichi]
"Didn't you get it?"
//HACK no need -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Are adventures included in 'travel'?"
//See CCB0005 -GHS

[Taichi]
"All of that is!"

[Sakuraba]
"All of that then... explorations too then."

[Taichi]
"All acts and conducts in general that get you out of this town."

[Sakuraba]
"'K, I understand."

Does he, seriously?

[Sakuraba]
"Say, one doubt I got."

[Taichi]
"'at?"

[Sakuraba]
"That kanji with two men surrounding one woman that somehow only means "to tease" (3P-style),"

[Taichi]
"Yup?"

[Sakuraba]
"Ain't it arousing."
//It looks random, but I think he's attempting to ellumicimdicidateferate(tm)(C) on how the kanji is a pun between Taichi's sexual issues and his teasing. Or something. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...but yer impotent, you son of a bitch."
//Thursday September 10, 1998 -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Taichiii〜!"
[Sakuraba]
"Heeeey, Taichiii〜!"

[Taichi]
"What is it now, what is it!"

[Sakuraba]
"Turns out I'm going on a trip!"

[Taichi]
"..."

Necknape Knifehand Strike.
//Curiously, the correct term is 手刀打ち, 手刀 alone seems to be that gesture of politeness that looks like praying with one hand (you know the one). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knifehand_strike is the formal term for Karate Chop. Oh, and best not to strike him on the ears... -GHS
HACK independent doll shake -GHS
And down falls Sakuraba.

[Sakuraba]
"...ngh, on a trip..."

[Taichi]
"You still saying that?"
[Taichi]
"Trips are forbidden."

[Sakuraba]
"That's harsh..."

[Taichi]
"Forbidden until next week."

[Sakuraba]
"So from next week I can?"

[Taichi]
"Yah. From next week it's okieh. Endure for a few days more."

[Sakuraba]
"Right... hum, understood."

[Taichi]
"That was a sudden one. Just from yesterday to today."

[Sakuraba]
"Listen here."

[Taichi]
"What now?"

[Sakuraba]
"I got sick of curry bread."

[Taichi]
"...listen here now."

[Sakuraba]
"The stimulus is no longer enough. I wanna go searching for something interesting."

[Taichi]
"Feels like you got fairy blood in your veins."
//Preliminary investigation from the anime highly inconclusive, but that one about the anthropomorphic space probes has to be the single most ass-backwards reference to Star Trek: The Motion Picture ever made. I guess that was necessary after David Bowie, Michael Jackson and 2001 ASO (still to come). "Back on topic", upside-down 人, or Y, is totally the love child of Taichi and Sakuraba. Squee, fangirls. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Besides it could even be that I'll meet people there."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."

That just means he hasn't thought through this at all, doesn't it.

[Sakuraba]
"Right, right, and I thought I'd give you back the money you lent me."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I did have to lend you some..."

[Sakuraba]
"How much was it even?"

Even if money's meaningless now, really.
So weird, this guy.

[Taichi]
"Dunno, I have nooo memory of how much."

[Sakuraba]
"For now I'm handing over my coin purse."

He takes out his wallet.

[Taichi]
"...uh-huh."

[Sakuraba]
"And, I'll be supplementing the amount that's missing with this."

He takes out a wooden box from the bag.

[Taichi]
"Ah, we're good with that... take it back home."

[Sakuraba]
"You sure? I think this is worth money."

[Taichi]
"Yes, but that's not happening. And it's out of the question not to donate that to some museum."
//Indiana Taichi? It's more interesting that he tells him to get it back. But he's going back home, and nothing should've changed back there He inadvertently broke the facade. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...?"
[Sakuraba]
"Say, about that trip next week."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, what."

[Sakuraba]
"Won't you come together with me?"

[Taichi]
"...me, traveling with you?"

[Sakuraba]
"How 'bout?"

[Taichi]
"...seems interesting, yeah."

Next week...

[Taichi]
"Fine, I'll go with ya."

[Sakuraba]
"Great, we'll become Twin Falcons."
//Suspecting it's this: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B5%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8A%E9%B7%B9 ...unless it means Eagles, and then... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, we're more like Tree Sparrow (those chatty ones) and Black Kite."
//Assuming it's a pun on the names of the guys above. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Well, about time I get to go on my trip."

[Taichi]
"You wait now!"
[Taichi]
"I told to be here until Sunday didn't I!"
//Can be read "live until Sunday". Since leaving the town by a route that goes by, but not through, the hokora is de-facto death... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Ah, my bad, forgot."

This is way too dangerous.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba, you are under arrest."
//See start of route. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...what?"

[Taichi]
"Arrested on the spot, no warrant."
//See CCA0002, and CCD5001 again. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"That hastily?!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed. And so, you will be living here until Sunday."

[Sakuraba]
"Mnuh..."

[Taichi]
"Also, I'll give you the second name of Pitiable Sakuraba."
//Saraba, Pitiable Sakuraba. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"You serious? Ain't that way too cool. It's decided."

Way Too Pitiable.
//Way Too Lame Gag, too. -GHS
I fenced in Sakuraba.
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS
Nothin'. -GHS
Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
Nothin'. -GHS
Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS
And then morning---
I am awake.

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Sakuraba, let's gooo."

[Sakuraba]
"Ah... and breakfast?"

[Taichi]
"You eat after you get over there."

[Sakuraba]
"Got that..."

[Taichi]
"Let's go."
//HACK nope -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...where we heading to?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, it's a picnic."
//HACK fade now -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"It's a very squalid picnic, innit."

[Taichi]
"Yup! Indeed the concept's like that."

[Sakuraba]
"Next week, I'm going on a trip."

[Taichi]
"Please go, do please go."

Great.
I brought Sakuraba to that place.

[Taichi]
"Grab this."

[Sakuraba]
"What's this? A radio?"

[Taichi]
"This'll make a good indicator."
[Taichi]
"...and, walk straight on from here."

[Sakuraba]
"Sure."

[Taichi]
"Slowly!"

[Sakuraba]
"Here?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's fine. Straight forwards... and stopp' there."

Snipe-OK.
Well then, it won't be for a few more minutes I guess.
We made it at just at the last moment, didn't we.

[Sakuraba]
"...say, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Sakuraba]
"How come you're doing this?"
//He knows exactly. And still he trusts him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Why, well it doesn't have much of a meaning."

[Sakuraba]
"...I think it got meaning."
[Sakuraba]
"Because you have those eyes, that's why."
//Sooo wonderfully ambiguous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you?"

[Sakuraba]
"Aren't the two of us buddies?"
//The entire Sakuraba/Yutaka subplot in one sentence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Budd...?!"

The hell's this guy saying!
I was at loss for words.
It's the 21st Century, right?
//Well, in about 27 months (15 for those who don't understand the calendar system, i.e. most of mankind). -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"We're now all done with our mate-ing, right?"

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba... you..."

[Sakuraba]
"That's something so lonely."
//The words he often uses, back at him. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"If you got to hate me, then nothing I can do, ya know."

[Taichi]
"...no, Sakuraba. That's not what it means."

[Sakuraba]
"Been just lots of weird things happening on these last few days."
[Sakuraba]
"Like people being no more..."

The sky darkened.

[Sakuraba]
"...or twilight coming suddenly."
//HE KNOWS ABOUT THE "LOOP". -GHS

There is no time.
I must send him back.
However,
to never see this idiot's face ever again---
Even if it's just that and nothing else.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba..."

[Sakuraba]
"But the most shocking thing was, even though you were cornered, you couldn't do anything about it."

[Taichi]
"You dumb bastard."
[Taichi]
"You stick to thinking about your own self. Yer a century too young to to be worrying about people! Your social class is that of someone who can't say serious stuff, Sakuraba!"
//It's more manga/shonen referencing. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...yourself from long ago felt just like that."
//See CCD0002: he totally fell in love with Taichi's aloofness, didn't he.  -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wha---"

[Sakuraba]
"'Cause recently you kept trying to overdo stuff."
[Sakuraba]
"It's so nostalgic."
//This is the implication that Taichi's problem is the exact same as Youko's and Touko's, in a sense. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...!"

Myself from long ago.
He made me remember it, right at this occasion.

[Taichi]
"...ya get out of here, you dumb son of a bitch."

Shutter click---
I Observed.
I closed my eyes, and on opening them---

[Sakuraba]
"...Taichi?"
[Sakuraba]
"...hm... sent back?"
//Literally knows. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"Taichi? The radio..."
[Sakuraba]
"............"
[Sakuraba]
"...right."
[Sakuraba]
"Riiight."
//HACK disconnected. This was missing from all the routes but Misato's. -GHS
HACK night hokora instead of the mountain path (WTF were they doing here???) -GHS

The 'shift' called Sakuraba was returned back to normalcy.

[Taichi]
"Seriously."

Buddies, then.
That there would exists a guy that would blurt out that right on this occasion.
That there would exist...

[Taichi]
"Hahahah."

Ridiculous.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, hahah."

I couldn't stop laughing,
but,
however much I laugh,
my vision would not blur---
//No tears -GHS
And that's why, Sakuraba,
I'm glad of this, that's what.
Now I'll never see that guy again.
The memories that I have stored are everything that Sakuraba is to me.

[Taichi]
"...iii-diot."
//Indeed. -GHS

I became oddly afraid, so I hold down my shaking knees.
I bowed down my head and closed my eyes.
My eyelids conveyed the invasion of the red.
//HACK earlier end music, NVL mode -GHS
     And once again the world went around---
//This and Miki's are the only one that are different of the Sendback routes. After all, they're the two most different characters of them all. The meaning is simple: the day's over. -GHS
