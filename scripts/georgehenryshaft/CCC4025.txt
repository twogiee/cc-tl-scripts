So then.
I went to the rooftop, and set right Tomoki's corpse.
//No mention of Kiri's. Ever. Is she just lying over there ignored by all? Did Miki do... what, exactly? Of course if she's not dead and just "out of the game" this doesn't matter. And Tomoki's corpse is never acknowledged by Miki, so it may well not exist. Same for Misato's. -GHS
I'll get the antenna completely off him... or try, as he had gone into rigor so that wasn't happening.

[Taichi]
"Damn you're stiff and uptight."

Just as the words say.
//Be glad I avoided "stick up your ass" puns. -GHS
I attempted to make him sit in the chair, but of course he's in rigor so that wasn't happening.
//Mirrors above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...oookay."

Nothing I can do but grab the ankle and pull while trampling on the shoulder, forcing a leveling.
//Difficult to tell without us being told how, exactly, Tomoki's already placed. He says he can't remove him from the antenna (or at least, not get the antenna out of him). Assuming he's in a ^ shape with the wire stuck in his chest from below, as he fell face-down from the stepladder. -GHS
Crack, went the sound.
//Cursed lawless non-joyo...! -GHS
Sorry, Tomoki's corpse.
But you're already Non-Soul Tomoki by now, right?
//ノンソウル seems to only return ノンソウル友貴. Letting Google suggest gives me http://health.goo.ne.jp/medicine/search/1846_1/no/0/indexdetail.html ...but it seems a stretch. -GHS
Once Tomoki became level, I propped him up against the fence.

[Taichi]
"Good one, Tomoki. With this, you're also in my Nakama of club participants. We're two but we'll get through this!"
//Going with him going back into lingo. -GHS

[Dethomoki]
"......"
//See below. The tags were never changed in either console version (and they just say "Tomoki"), but in ToF 360 they were changed in this format, so using it anyway. -GHS

There is no reply. He's just like a dead body.
//Inverted corpse with dead body as 'dead body' sounds awkward above. -GHS
No, it's because he's a dead body...
The antenna was broken,
so now I understand:
it seems that Tomoki went to destroy the antenna.
Too much resentment for Mimi-senpai... her Aneki.
This was just in the way.
And then, the wrecked antenna... ah, Tomoki...
//Avoiding verbs good. -GHS
Senpai came to the rooftop, and saw the corpse of her brother.
And then... fell.
Tomoki had been killed by coincidence.
//...technically carelessness isn't coincidence. Now that you mention it, Youko was carelessness, Touko was functionally suicide, Sakuraba was de-facto suicide, Tomoki was carelessness, Misato was suicide and Kiri was flat-out murder. I get where Tanaka's going, but none of them died e.g. by walking out and being struck by a falling brick, I'm sayin'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dammit, it's all your fault the antenna got shorter, that's a big problem!"

[Dethomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"You playing the silent type? Damn you're a taciturn asshole."

So then.
While we're having this fun chat with Tomoki's corpse, how about club.
Adjust the height of the mike,
power on,
frequency... best if I don't mess with how it's now, I guess.
Well, it should be adequate, yeah.
//We can hear him just fine anyway. -GHS
I'm sure... this, and that one... we should be good.
Begin broadcast.

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm..."
[Taichi]
"Hmmm, what do I do now..."

Ruminating.
My position's apolitical without any particular contentions.
//Of course, Taichi's is... the story's? Hoo boy. -GHS
Hmmm.
Got it!

[Taichi]
"Ehhh, this... is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Channel... channel name's... ehhh... Akai Sasori, or Red Scorpio. I think we're gonna stab you so fast our stingers will look like machine guuuns!"
//Unfortunately Phantasy Star Online dominates search results for Red Scorpio in Japanese, and an Indian car in English. Given all the warnings in CCC4024, and how this reference returns, it means Nanaka. Ban-ban, see CCA0015 etc. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Today's guest comes straight from the Roads of Hades, let us welcome Dethomoki-san."

[Dethomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"He's a cool sha'h boy, yup."
//dagnabbit -GHS
[Taichi]
"Ehhh..."
//It's interesting how "ehh" isn't really a typical Japanese filler moans. You'd find "anoo" or "ettoo"; "ehh" is usually reserved for surprise or disappointment. Since it's never been used before in this sense (though once in CCA0027 comes close), I suspect this is intentional. And the intention would be to make him sound suspiciously foreign, precisely because of this. -GHS
[Taichi]
"First of all, is anybody still living out there?"
[Taichi]
"...if there's anyone, whatever's happening, please keep living."
[Taichi]
"Stay alive until the day you die, please."
//And if you don't find a welcome there... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because all possible values are built with living at its root, aren't they Dethomoki-san?"
//Well, no, not at all. That's why he's talking to the possibly imaginary dead body of a friend, after all. And this would exclude anything even remotely related to self-sacrifice and materialistic self-preservation, as well. But this stuff's over most people's heads anyway, so Taichi having no clue is still in character, regardless of whether Tanaka understands it himself or not. -GHS

[Dethomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"What a stylish, taciturn guy."
//He the Silent Protagonist nau. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Oh well, dying's OK too I guess, but..."
//More than suggesting suicide as a valid alternative, he seems to be sort-of realizing the contradiction above and dissembling, good Nietzscheian he is. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I think, human relations, aren't they more important than what we ourselves think?"
[Taichi]
"The influence we get from other people creates our selves."
//He still assumes there's nothing at the base, however. This is not quite correct. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I recognize that as fact, but how about you?"
//Everyone's got that he's been talking to the player all along in these segments, right? Good. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It's fine if you're living on your own, but... only if you have the strength for that."
//"Uhm, yeah, you gotta live, but no prob if you die, and and and, and others are important but if you can live alone, well, whatever". Points for trying, but he's still dissembling. This message makes no sense, and it's likely intentional. Like CCC3030 started with a lie, this proceeds into one. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Just, it's because I think most people are weak. Me too, mind you."
[Taichi]
"If one were to seriously become alone, I think, he'd totally break."
//...he himself never becomes alone, after all... -GHS
[Taichi]
"I know, this world's full of malice."
[Taichi]
"It's pretty much all malice, I know."
[Taichi]
"...and despite that, someone's there, yes."
[Taichi]
"There's someone there, outside of yourself."
//...even just the author of a story, existing in the words and actions of his characters, him and his fundamental will of being with others, entertaining others... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because---"

[Miki]
"Humans should be fine as long as they have themselves, right Senpai?"
//In other words, solitude, but not of the kind that Taichi has at the end - the one he still thinks should be the Perfection of Mankind. IOW: incoming troll! -GHS

Stop,
look.
Miki.

[Taichi]
"Miki...?"

[Miki]
"The notebook has been enshrined."

[Taichi]
"Wait, what...?
[Taichi]
"You OK with the time?"

[Miki]
"It'll probably be soon."
//Should be 11, leaving around 2 hours (let's make it round) for Miki to go back and forth, meaning they left at 9-9:30. Waking at 7, kissing until 8, bath till ~9, miscellanea. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's bad then. If you don't hurry back..."

She was dripping with sweat,
she might have run all the way back, perhaps,
but for what purpose?

[Miki]
"...ahhh, I won't make it in time even if I go back now, you know?"
//Ergo <1h left, likelihood of it being 11 very much certain. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What are you doing? Hurry and get going!"

[Miki]
"I'll go when I have finished with my errand here. Because I'm someone with the Reeeally Thinks Herself Important Attribute."
//Typically, Taichi's the one to do the VN-meta character analysis... as for what she means with the "errand here", that means she's had her Revelation and she's ready to let go for now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Errand?"
//Going with Mark 6:10-11. He wasn't talking about just the Twelve. -GHS

Her facial expression tightens.
//Kiri-tto. -GHS

[Miki]
"Senpai, this world... is not the world where we lived in."
//Totally false, and totally true. Sometimes it is just awesome. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Miki]
"Please read this. Because it is the easiest to understand."
//Notice: not "the truth". -GHS

Miki produced a thick diary book.
//See CCA0012. Never changed in any version. It's a term that's used to describe only two things, and that's this diary here, and the first diary Taichi uses back in Weeks 1 and 2 - which isn't a college notebook, but a proper diary book. This route may be less edited than most, but Tanaka'd better go hide in shame if this is a screwup. I'm assuming this is intentional, and the Sakakibara diary is actually the same diary as in CCA0012. There's more evidence, see CCA0013: his diary habit may be borne from Sakakibara's exchange diary assignment. And since that was a flashback, and it mentioned writing "terrible things" in his diary, intended to be the fictional dialogue about Touko in the 'real' world the evening before... what if fiction was what he wrote in the diary? -GHS

[Miki]
"From page 52."
//5+2=7 -GHS

I try reading.
//There's little reason to censor the date unless the lack of it was a point. If we go by Japanese standards, month is O (circle, loop, correct) while day is X (cross, Taichi, incorrect), which is symbolism that returns (loop, Taichi). Leaving them rather literal. -GHS
Month O, day X
It has been one month since the confirmed
beginning of a wide-scale rapture.
//Why even joke around at this point? -GHS
People have been disappearing in the blink
of an eye.
When do they vanish?
How do they vanish?
There is no one who has seen the instant of
disappearance.
//Up to thousands of people in the town alone, over the course of at least one or more months, and NO ONE HAS SEEN THIS. It's not unlikely, it's outright ridiculous! Isn't this happening worldwide, too? It's never mentioned, though since "worldwide" here means "in the Valley" there's that to remember. Tanaka in interview talks of it being just the story's stage, but... not even a sidelong mention? This transcends economy of writing as well as suspension of disbelief. -GHS
Mankind did not even have the spare time to
try to explain the cause.
The population of Kamisaka, as well, is
now half or less.
//BTW: this isn't how your archetypal professor would write, even if he's someone who likes to make bishoujo figurines... in itself something highly suspicious. -GHS
The number of students has also decreased.
There's this student named Kurosu who
is like always.
//And all the autistic ones who can't see anyone outside 30cm have changed? Kiri hasn't, for example. Is everyone else also dead? Odd he'd single out Taichi. -GHS
In this crisis situation he is living
all merry, unchanged.
//Less people = more mask. That's his way of snapping. -GHS
He is one of the most serious cases, but he
looks so extremely healthy. How ironic.
When will I myself vanish?
//The oddness of Taichi being one of the most serious cases continues... -GHS
Month O, day X
Classes became free participation.
//See CCA0007, CCA0022. There's nothing in what's been seen that suggest this isn't normal. -GHS
Of ten students there is one left now, and
there doesn't seem to be anything we can do
about it.
I, at my house, am only messing about
with figurines.
But there's no one to look at them,
no one to like them.
//See CCA0021. How very Taichi of him for a non-Taichi. -GHS
This isn't anything more than self-satisfaction.
It's good that I don't have family.
//They hire a figurine expert with no social skills as professor at Danger High. Of course, that might just be where bad careers go to die, but... -GHS
I doubt I'd have endured their disappearance
if I did.
The power plant ended up being shut down.
Of course.
//That 'of course' is very typical of Taichi. Of course, it's not exactly an uncommon thing to say in Japanese. -GHS
Month O, day X
I tossed away the figurines.
As people are no more, hobbies by themselves
become meaningless.
I can't set my mind to do anything.
The world needs to be stable:
that directly ties to the enjoyability of a hobby.
Even a misanthrope like me still has a
connection to the world.
//THIS is closer to the central message of Cross Channel: even those shut-ins who play VNs have a connection to the world. Their escape is not full, nor is such escape even possible. -GHS
The circulation of goods is barely surviving.
And food, we're making do one way or another
due the decreased headcount.
//See CCA0022. Still connects. -GHS
Bartering has grown more common.
//See CCC3007, CCC0031B. Interesting. -GHS
I really really really want to eat some steak.
Month O, day X
Even if I go into town I rarely see
anyone anymore.
//Of course, you moron, everyone's out of town working! -GHS
Is there still anyone alive?
I ended up prowling around.
//Just like Taichi. -GHS
TV had lost its functionality.
//If you thought "can't use" is suspect, have a load of this! Of course it can mean "stopped working", but it's a very weird way of saying that if so. "I can't see the point of TV anymore" is just as plausible. -GHS
The radio is only static too, and I can't
hear anything on it.
//Suspiciously specific wording yet again. He's not hearing anything; it doesn't mean no one's transmitting. -GHS
It's quiet. It feels like I'm going crazy.
//The cicadas are likely gone too. -GHS
Month O, day X
Today I didn't meet anyone either.
Month O, day X
A delivery truck came,
but the driver wasn't there anymore.
I searched here and there, but he wasn't anywhere.
//He was maybe somewhere around, but he couldn't see him. Maybe they couldn't see each other. -GHS
Only the truck with the engine on was left.
Frightened. I am frightened.
//See CCC3030. And once more. -GHS
Month O, day X
I borrowed things from the truck.
//"Borrowed", yes. Odd he'd do it on another day; but maybe he's already in a time compression himself. (Even if it's not just Taichi chuunin'.) -GHS
It was all bread.
Still, I don't want the curry bread.
//He dislikes it, just like Taichi. And apparently everyone; public education would explain why they keep bringing it in, but this still makes only real sense if Curry is Christianity. Which will never stop sounding weird. -GHS
I divided my own share into so many parts
and carried it to my house.
//"My own share". Maybe he means "all but the curry bread", but that's still a very odd way to put it all things considered. -GHS
I carried the curry bread cases to the
school cafeteria, and left them there.
//Except, you'll remember, it's not just curry bread; there's also croquette bread. Maybe he mixed one-two in by mistake; maybe I'm an unicorn. (That has happened to me in the past, dammit.) This is also intended to be the reason why in CCC0020 the amount of cases isn't enough, but as it's said there, Sakuraba actually tosses the rest. This is an inconsistency that only makes sense if the chuuni is increasing. -GHS
If anyone has survived, they'll probably eat it.
Month O, day X
Today I'm also not meeting anyone.
//PCP above. suuuuuuubtly different... -GHS
Month O, day X
Is there no one out there...?
Month O, day X
I met Yamanobe Miki.
//What a coincidence she'd still be alive... -GHS
I was ecstatic.
But Yamanobe was scared. She didn't pay
attention to me.
//Compare CCZAS, where Taichi also does the same. -GHS
She said something about Kurosu.
//CCZAS still. Taichi understands when she talks about Kiri. -GHS
Is Kurosu dangerous?
I don't get what she means.
//He's now becoming incapable of understanding people, perhaps in the same way that Taichi is. Is he having the same breakdown? It'd be less suspicious if this diary were written by Taichi himself. -GHS
Yamanobe ran away.
//She renounces an ally? What did Sakakibara do? -GHS
I searched for her throughout the night,
but I couldn't discover her.
//Suspicious terminology continues and continues. -GHS
Month O, day X
Yamanobe had died. Good Lord.
//No details. Curiouser and curiouser. -GHS
She was killed. By someone.
//See ToF again. Remember the beginning, where, in the first of Taichi's delusion, Miki was already dead. And then she came back for reasons inexplicable and was utterly unintelligible. And then he killed her. And then she got up and vanished. -GHS
Kurosu? Was this what she meant with
Kurosu being dangerous?
//But he didn't actually hear anything now, did he... -GHS
Certainly Kurosu is a seriously
Nonconforming one, but...
There is something that has caused all this.
I want to meet people.
//"See" might be too obvious... maybe. -GHS
Tomorrow, I think I will go search for Kurosu.
But anyone'd be fine, too.
//See CCX0001 -GHS
This is where it interrupts.
//See CCZAS for what is intended to go there... except it's contradictory. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...is this... Sakakibara's diary?"

[Miki]
"A long time ago, when I was investigating all around... I discovered it."
//Notice the answer is not "yes"; just that she discovered it. Or rather, that she has "...discovered" it. See CCC0007: similar terms to what Youko's doing. -GHS
[Miki]
"This here is a different world."
//From Heaven, yes. From where they were, technically yes, since it's Taichi's chuuni. Literally? No. Most importantly, absolutely nothing in what's in the diary above proves this in the absolute slightest. In fact, this is a complete non-sequitur! -GHS
[Miki]
"It's sort of identical, but it's a different world."
[Miki]
"...it's an empty world, a world where the original inhabitants aren't anymore."
[Miki]
"We were all thrown into it. Maybe, on the return from that training camp..."
//Absolutely nothing in the diary supports these assertions, but this least of all. -GHS

My physical heart took a leap.
//It's pure troll... -GHS
On the return from the training camp.
Then, then---
These eyes---
//His eyes, his wrong perception of things. Hint, hint, hint. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...where was this?"
//He's reiterating the question. And it's rather silly to ask, in a sense. If it's Sakakibara's diary, shouldn't it be in his house? -GHS

[Miki]
"There is one in almost every house. That one is just the easiest to understand."
//And the answer is again evasive, instead of a clear "in Sakakibara's house, doofus" or something. And she's deflecting again, because he asks whose diary is it and where she found it, and she keeps telling him it's the easiest way to understand. But nothing in the diary supports her conclusion regardless! -GHS
[Miki]
"Another you, a me, and an everyone else lived in this world, Senpai."
//...except this line can literally be read as "it's not like there was any of that". -GHS
[Miki]
"And, maybe, Sakakibara-sensei was also killed, I think."
[Miki]
"Because a corridor in the Institute was stained with blood."
//The way she jumps to conclusions is between the crazy and the suspiciously deliberate. It's Miki's, see CCZAS... except it should predate the loop. But ToF isn't so clear, though Biblically the Tower of Babel is post-flood, so it should also be post-disappearance of everyone. If taken laterally, still with ToF being the Babel event, then this isn't a different world: it's a different part of it. And the disappearance of her body remains unexplained, so it's still no sell. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...was it... me?"
//More jumping to conclusions. -GHS

[Miki]
"The Senpai of this world."

[Taichi]
"I've..."

[Miki]
"Of this world!"
//Now THIS makes sense. "Be in this world, not of it". The Taichi of this world could literally be a Biblical reference. ...and the diarybook that's in nearly everybody's house? Perhaps a Bible... -GHS

[Taichi]
"But that's... me."

I dropped the diary.
//Without checking anything else. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dammit, you good-for-nothing---"

[Miki]
"It's alright."

She holds me in her arms.

[Miki]
"So calm down."

I return the embrace.
Tiny little Miki that grants me such a huge peace of mind.

[Taichi]
"...worlds... are crossing."
//Of course, it's true and false in many ways. The easiest falsification is this: if Nanaka is a manifestation of his memories, how does SHE remember how the world ended, when it's something he couldn't possibly have even the most remote knowledge of? Unless of course she hasn't, the wave that expands is his Denpa, and he's afraid of telling him because, well, you don't wake a sleepwalker and you don't go telling about Christianity to those who reject listening with every fiber of their being, I guess. -GHS

And that point of intersection is this world of one week.
//He remains sooo easily convinced, as with all the above. -GHS
Preposterous... so SF-like.
//Sukishi Fushigi again. -GHS
But.

[Taichi]
"...and you intentionally came back with the purpose of telling me this?"

[Miki]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"Isn't that meaningless?"

[Miki]
"Indeed. I only noticed now."
//It's not meaningless for the reader. But yes, this can't end with this, not at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...yer lying."

[Miki]
"Yes."
//FINALLY the truth. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You stupid?"

[Miki]
"But..."
[Miki]
"I fell in love."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"I fell in love with you, Senpai... we had sex..."
[Miki]
"Turns out I like this Senpai here!"

I'm hugged even more. Hard.

[Miki]
"This Senpai here, and now."
//"She fell in love with Taichi" - does this mean she fell in love with ALL of them, or just this one? CCZAS implies the former, she's attempting to imply the latter. This is why the sex scene implied her love might have a different meaning from the usual. -GHS
[Miki]
"Coming to love someone... I didn't understand it..."
[Miki]
"I didn't think it would hurt like this!"
//See CCD5001, more Youko-likes -GHS
[Miki]
"My heart... feels pungent."
//AFAICGS, it's about tear-inducing smell. -GHS
[Miki]
"Tears leak out."
[Miki]
"My nose leaks out."
[Miki]
"My face becomes indecent, my heart runs out of control."
[Miki]
"There's no logic."
[Miki]
"...just warmth."

[Taichi]
"I'm grateful, but... didn't you like Kiri-chin too?"

[Miki]
"Like... yes, I do think so."
[Miki]
"But I broke her..."
[Miki]
"I have killed Kiri-chin so many times now."
[Miki]
"All for me to live... all Kiri could do was draw your attention as you grew scary, Senpai."
//Except that looking at this route, Kiri's the one who snapped due to Miki's manipulation, and SHE came closest to make Taichi snap. The blood is the cause, she says? He's had no serious reaction all the way from the very start of the route! Taichi going rampant, at best, could be said to be about Youko. And that ties back to her being his split personality. -GHS

For the sake of striking at my vulnerability.

[Miki]
"Hasekura-senpai, with Taichi-senpai... because of this monster of a duo I couldn't but live on the brink of death."
//"These two monsters", maybe... but "the one monster these two make" could also be it. This is forced enough that I'm leaving it as an odd suspicion. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'pologies."

[Miki]
"...I am so tired."
[Miki]
"I... don't want to kill anymore."
//Now she's finally - FINALLY! - Taichi. -GHS
[Miki]
"It's so hard... to do that..."
[Miki]
"Every time I kill Kiri-chin, a big chunk of my heart gets chipped off."
[Miki]
"...I repeat those memories so many times over... and having to live... with that inside... it's... it's..."

She spits it out.

[Miki]
"It is Hell."
//See CCD0022B. Christian explanation continues! What happened at the hokora was that she had a revelation, of sorts at least. ...but no one leaves the world excepts through Taichi, who's yet to ascend to his role. -GHS
[Miki]
"That's why... I have... chosen."
[Miki]
"...all, I will forget it all."
//It's not throwing it in the fire that spawned it, but it's a refusal to wield the One Loop. It's Yutaka's choice, but as Taichi showed, forgetting the past doesn't mean erasing it. -GHS

It resounded with dignity.
Her determination made those words sacred.

[Taichi]
"...Miki... nice girl!"

[Miki]
"I'm broken... and I didn't think of people as being people either..."

[Taichi]
"A much nicer one than I."
//...for now. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I could say, Miki, that you have quite a ways to go before you become a good-for-nothing monster like I am."
//Whiner. Truth is, she took how many loops to realize this wouldn't work? He'll take one. -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

With words,
I try striking Miki's heart,
in the way one would use one's hands to knock,
//See CCC0039 -GHS
gently.

[Taichi]
"You don't have the talent, Miki."

[Miki]
"Ahahah... hahahah..."
[Miki]
"Dooo I now, eh... hahahah... hah... unh..."

Laughter with a crying voice.

[Taichi]
"...that triple date was so fun."
//No 嬲? -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"It's gotta have been lonely, though, living all on your own."

[Miki]
"...that never happened. Because I believe myself to be the most important of all!"

[Taichi]
"And that's another lie."
//Indeed, or she wouldn't stay around people or try to interfere. Interesting to compare with Rika doing everything alone vs. Rika just telling her damn friends about it already. -GHS
[Taichi]
"When at last... we had found understanding."

It will all become nothing.
When it comes to my most sacred of selves, I'd pay any price, I'd make anyone victim.
//See CCC3023. He doesn't make anyone a victim for that, in fact, he went and disillusioned Kiri off of the pedestal she put Yutaka in. That's not murder, that's making her realize people can't necessarily be All Right or All Wrong. -GHS
And Miki, herself, never went further than doing that.
Suddenly, I begin to want for Miki's existence to continue.
//Suddenly he fails to understand the point of this all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...let's go to the hokora. If we use a car---"
//On the thin mountain trail that takes an hour to traverse? -GHS

[Miki]
"It is too late already."
//Oh, it's past 11:30 already. -GHS

And that moment, abruptly,
the sky darkened.

[Taichi]
"?!"

[Miki]
"It's started..."

The Miki that preserved herself until now,
this Miki that has built herself up so much,
will be reset.
It's true.
It's true, the world is going to be rewound.
That is... curtains for Miki's eigentime. In other words,
//カット カット カットカットカットカットカット!!! Melty Blood reference or not, going with a theatrical side-ference. -GHS
it means partial vanishment.
Miki was shaking,
within my arms.
Terror.
//See CCC3030. -GHS
Indeed.
Miki's terror should be more serious compared to mine.
Fear is natural.
I push her head further into my chest.
//This is an inversion of CCC3030, and closer to CCC3010. -GHS

[Miki]
"Sooo scary, please keep hugging me close, OK?"

[Taichi]
"Be at ease. I'm also fairly scared."

[Miki]
"Even the memories we have of this conversation, all will be no more..."

I pat her in the back with one the hands engaged in the hug.

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha think too hard 'bout that stuff now."

[Miki]
"Egwh..."

[Taichi]
"Wonder how we'll vanish, exactly."

[Miki]
"On my part I am inexperienced."

[Taichi]
"Sooo you are, right."

[Miki]
"What do you think happened to Sakuraba-senpai?"

[Taichi]
"I've set him as dead in my Settings. Inside of me."
//Settei. This is what he did to Sakuraba, so how about he does that to everyone? -GHS

[Miki]
"Again with that lovelessness..."

[Taichi]
"Don't you go saying that!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah!"

It was just like a normal everyday conversation.

[Taichi]
"Dammit, you just bring this all to an end without any hesitation, you stupid world."

[Miki]
"Say, Taichi-senpai?"

[Taichi]
"What is it, Mai Girl?"

[Miki]
"Love ya."

Those ended up being the last words I ever heard.
