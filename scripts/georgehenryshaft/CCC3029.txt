My home.
In this space, always so lonely, today there blooms a flower.

[Taichi]
"Well, come in."

[Kiri]
"S-, sorry for intruding..."
[Kiri]
"Whoa..."

My room was a lover of chaos and disorder.
//And now, contrast to Youko's room(s). -GHS
Guests were usually astonished.

[Taichi]
"Gladden me with sitting."
//He actually says tamaHe instead of tamae, so I'm going with the usual tweaks made with this kind of tongue slips and therefore "gladden me with sHi-GHS

[Kiri]
"...where would I even sit."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I pass the Tonbo mud rake.
//This was a thirty-minutes hectic googlin'. It's a sort-of-dragonfly-shaped rake: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%88%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9C_%28%E9%81%93%E5%85%B7%29 -GHS

[Kiri]
"...here, you say."

[Taichi]
"Make space in whatever place you want to sit."

[Kiri]
"............"

At her own risk and responsibility,
Kiri sits in an awkward seiza in the gap made by the tonbo.

[Kiri]
"...men..."

[Taichi]
"Wait up here a biiit."

I fly down to the floor below and bring tomatoes back.
//Tomoki again? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Here, vitamins."

[Kiri]
"...thanks."

Timidly and hesitatingly, she gnaws into the tomato.

[Taichi]
"Feel free to relax! You will always live here."
//...going with ambiguous. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ngh."

All motions come to a halt on the spot.

[Kiri]
"Always... you say?"

[Taichi]
"No like?"

[Kiri]
"...I do not understand."
[Kiri]
"And now that Senpai has been... my first man..."

Whoa.

[Kiri]
"And, I think of this as a compensation."
//See CCD1001. It can't work, either direction. -GHS
[Kiri]
"My share and Yutaka's."

Yutaka, then.
No matter when no matter where, Kiri would still continue to be that kind of person.
//As in, dependent on someone else. It's not Yutaka that pisses him off here, at least, not directly. -GHS
Yutaka. Yutaka. Yutaka.
Yutaka.

[Taichi]
"...do you want me to feed that tomato to you?"
//He's now trying to steal her from him even more. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh?"

I grab Kiri's tomato, and bite into it,
and after chewing it for so many times, I kiss her.

[Kiri]
"Ngh-?!"

I poured it inside her mouth, together with saliva.

[Kiri]
"...nh, hfhah... nkh, nh, nnnnh!"

She only had opposition at the outset.

[Taichi]
"Delicious?"

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"Then eat some more!"

I repeat this several times.
//7? -GHS
By the time we finished, Kiri's cheeks were flushed.

[Taichi]
"Kiri is my Kiri alone now."

[Kiri]
"...so I am."

[Taichi]
"But... you seem so sad."

On saying that, Kiri forcefully makes a smile.
...I did not see it as being anything more than a drawing of the lips.
I embrace her, and slowly pushed her down.
//See Yusa -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah..."

The half-eaten fruit fell to the floor.
//See CCA0012. SYMBOLISM!!! of more Touko. -GHS
The hokora is spooky in the dead of night.
I offer it the diary.
//There were lots of white lines around the single line for six notebooks (check the original script), suggesting that a similar thing to what should happen in CCC0007 should've been here. -GHS
It is the sixth notebook.

[Taichi]
"Right."

Unexpectedly, a thought.
The notebooks used as diaries will be enshrined here.
The world is rewound sometime starting tomorrow.
Therefore, the notebooks will disappear.
It's no wonder that, Monday, I just couldn't find the diary I wanted to write on.
//This is a minor plot inconsistency again without something like what's in CCA0007. He fails to find a diary if this is the second or further attempt through the route, though then there's the chastity belt disappearing that's a bigger plot hole. This part here would explain that the time loop doesn't duplicate stuff. ...or rather, that he puts this stuff in the hokora so he obviously can't find it. This may have been intended to only be read on second/third reads of the route, but frankly, that'd have been really annoying so it was probably left unimplemented. -GHS
The inside of the hokora seems, truly, carved from different rules than those that govern the rewinding.
//And also the area around it, which is Holy Ground ~sanctuary~. That seems less a plot hole and just Taichi's chuuni increasing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I get it now..."

I placed the diary.
This is the act of saving.
//The hokora is the save file. -GHS
From the last moment I wrote the diary onwards, the... personal individual life for myself only begins.
There'll be no redoing.
It's a life of a single solitary day, that may not even be life.
//Spoiled iiit. -GHS
I thought I would live as I please, and then disappear.
//Instead... -GHS
