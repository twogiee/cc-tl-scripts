Shinkawa Yutaka was in high spirits. Almost always.
Replies came quick.
//This sounds like a problem in Gunjou. -GHS
The way he talked was sharp and clever.
Quite good on the back-and-forth of jokes, too.
Shinkawa once said this:

[Shinkawa]
『Got a niece, ya know, 'course she goes to Gunjou, ya know, so she's telling me lots and lots of stuff.』

We discussed it harshly.
//揉 used only literally. Wait, no, only laterally. Wait, no, uhmmm -GHS
How she was fairly cute, for starters.
And we furthermore discussed. It was envy with jealousy.
//See CCA0018B, it's just more remembering of how he didn't exactly look at girls with pure eyes... possibly ever. Not that Taichi isn't being a hypocrite here, but his fears that Yutaka would do bad stuff to Kiri are the source of his jealousy. -GHS
If both of those are present, hatred would normally ensue, and regardless of who's their target. It's human.
I did not have hatred.
//See CCC3026, CCC3030 -GHS
But the next remark by Yutaka provoked even further jolts in me:
//It's just "I received a shock" written high... -GHS

[Shinkawa]
『Seriously, she's kinda like a little sister, 's all. 's just cohabitation.』

He is living together with a Cute Non-Blood Related Imouto-like being.
//Fetishist term -GHS
And also, some time later I heard that their parents seemed to almost never be home.
//The typical VN trope of absent parentage (see Misato and Taichi, for starters). It's all but a recipe for your typical nukige, and Yutaka's backstory is that of Rapist Protagonist already. It's very possible that Taichi, at this point, genuinely fears for whoever the cousin is, even if he doesn't recognize Yutaka consciously at this point. -GHS
The abovementioned 'chewation is ungenerally referred to as 'sharing the house'.
//The opposite of 一般的 (and still pronounced 'ippanteki'), see below -GHS
The two of them ended up both going to Gunjou.

[Shinkawa]
『Oh, I'll be introducing you to the niece then!』
[Shinkawa]
『...it ain't much of a big deal so... don't expect much, will ya?』

Not much of a big deal.
Later on, I ended up meeting her for real.
//Taichi met Kiri before the scene in CCA0018B, but was only properly introduced here. -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"Introductions then, this here's Sakura Kiri. She's sorta like family."

The abovementioned is generally referred to as a 'thunderbolt out of the blue'.
//Opposite of that 'ungenerally'. And now, pattern recognition time! What comes next after 霹 thunder and 靂 lightning? Obvious: 霧 fog. -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"What's it, you guys just shut up? Don'tcha tell me, you guys're all shy? C'mon, c'mon, I understand Kiri, but Taichi, no need to be all shy in front of this bumpkin, right!"

[Kiri]
"Yutaka, shut up..."
//What respect Kiri has for Yutaka. Of course, she's tsundere, but... see CCA0018B -GHS
[Kiri]
"...I am Sakura Kiri."

[Taichi]
"I-, I am Kurosu Taichi."

I bow my head in awkward embarrassment.
//He's more terrified of her than she is of him. Oh, it's an act, of course... see CCC3027. -GHS

[Taichi]
"He-, heard quite a lot about you."

[Kiri]
"...huh."

It was her... that terrifying heel user.
//Contrast CCC3002. -GHS
We certainly parted with vows of revenge.
I could not catch a glint of favoritism in Kiri's eyes.
//That's the word generally used for Youko's feelings for Taichi. -GHS
Or should I say, she's staring at me scornfully.

[Kiri]
"I have also heard a lot about you, heard indeed."

[Taichi]
"Ha-, have you?"

I put the teacup to my mouth despite the mental strain.
//He's a multiple murderer who'd take three seconds to crush her if he ever got serious, and the only competition in there's a cripple. Why would he have a mental strain? At least part of this must be pretension. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wooow, this black tea's sweet ain't iiit! It's just like sugar, yes. And somehow just a little coarse and granular. It's a novel food texture ain't it."
//He just gulped down a teacup with nothing but sugar in it, didn't he. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

Harsh.
The performance of a Straight-Man Retort is, in a certain sense, a representation of reciprocal kindness.

[Shinkawa]
"Right, naturally, ain't it sugar that."
//Seems he spotted him drinking a cup of sugar. Pun is "it's natural sugar" + "of course, moron, that's just sugar". -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I am greatly obliged."
//For the tsukkomi. Even if it's sub-Tomoki level. -GHS

It's something that went all the way down to the heart.
//See CCC3027 - black sugar sediments in the heart... -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I am told that you perform sexual harassment on anyone and everyone you can lay your hands on."

[Shinkawa]
"Doooes 'e now, this guy, that's some weeeird stuff he does. Pretty freaky!"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, no, that would be well, calling it something like sexual harassment... it is... a sexual related expression of endearment that has no guilty intent whatsoever!"
//I think he meant "mean intent" there, but... cross conversation! -GHS

[Kiri]
"And that is called, 'sexual harassment'."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, that is what it seemed like! HA. HA. HA..."
//Mechanical laugh + continuing cross conversations. While the metasuggestions are that this his awkwarndness is real, from Kiri's side, Taichi is being a dangerous sociopath. That's why Kiri hates his guts. -GHS

A knife I could not see pierced me with slashes and thrusts.
//Origins of the Knife (tune in tonight for part one, only on The History Channel). -GHS

[Kiri]
"...but you do it to the reluctant ones as well, do you?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, I'm properly prudent with reluctant partners you know? That is, I can tell when a partner is disagreeing from the bottom of the heart, yesss!"
//Ambiguity continues -GHS

[Kiri]
"Did Miyuki wish to be sexually harassed then?"
//Did you see the goalpost move? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, was she reluctant, maybe I wonder? But that's just on the surface it is, ojou-san. Yes, because even if her mouth doesn't say it, her body has evidence."
//See CCA0012. Recurring ain't it. Right now, the reader should be thinking that he wasn't being funny when he wrote that, which is why it was repeated right at the start of this route. Kiri certainly doesn't. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...disgusting."

In a low voice, as if spitting my way.
//See parts of Week 1... right around before meeting Kiri, actually. -GHS
I heard it, but,
Yutaka did not hear, lost as he is his enthusiastic tearing apart a Baumkuchen by thin stripes.
//great now I'm hungry again. This way of eating it seems to be the subject of at least one moe slice of life scene. I wouldn't know since I'm a teh litfags or something so I don't watch Animuhs unless they have like 300000 Hard Kanji's per scene or stuff. More on the topic: does Yutaka have ears that know how to hear? This is important, see Sakuraba below. -GHS
Can't this ghoul of a brat just not read the mood?
//Another absolutely normal term that is also the name of a traditional Japanese monster, see CCA0018B. -GHS
Crackle, crackle an electric eye-sign is sent.
//See CCC0026 -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"!"
//This used the wrong nametag, fixed in the console version. -GHS

Yutaka notices.
Yes, help me please!
I speak with eloquence via eyes.
//See CCA0027, CCB0022 -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"!!!"
//Idem. -GHS

With a face that's Club President Class as far as pride, Yutaka signaled a "leave it all to me!" with a tiny nod.
//I think this means his disattention is Misato class, i.e. he's wilfully disregarding what's going on. All he's reading is that Taichi likes Kiri; unfortunately, he isn't wrong in the slightest. Like Sakuraba, he tends to react to what Taichi means, not to what he says. -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"Ah... no way, my period's begun. I gotta put on a pad, so in the while you two get chatting will you?"
//As far as bad lies, this is Taichi level. Of course, they have the same backstory, likely the same teacher(s). However, what you're now wondering if whether Shinkawa, due to his backstory, has regular blood leaks from his being repeate-GHS

[Kiri]
"Stay."

[Taichi]
"Please stay, I beg you."

[Shinkawa]
"?"

He didn't understand anything at all.
This bomb of unpleasantness might just explode if it's just the two of us alone.
//The explosive birth of the Humanity Annihilation Bomb? Also, futari-KIRI. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Miyuki wanted her skirt flipped you say... that did not appear to be the case to me."

[Taichi]
"Mmmh, re-, really?"

Yutaka begins once more his disassembly of the Baumkuchen.
Hopeless... this guy is just...

[Kiri]
"Therefore, what you have done, Kurosu-senpai, is something I have a problem with."

So she says sharply.
//HakKIRI. Damn puns... -GHS
Looked at calmly, she is not the disliking type.
Rather, the likeable one... a girl that leaves me the sense of a desire to approach.
//Also be a measure of what she is (dere with a cover of tsun due to circumstances, like Touko), not just that she's his type... if only because his type is "attractive human females". ...well, "attractive aloof females", but... -GHS
I felt a bit relaxed.
I wanted to talk frankly to her.

[Taichi]
"...Sakura-san, you're a woman among women, a Woman of Justice."
//漢. -GHS

She seemed to grow testy.
//Of course, she probably knows this Ally of Justice stuff is just shonen manga crap. -GHS

[Kiri]
"What would that even be?"

[Taichi]
"Welll, it's a good thing. I think that's the kind of human that's necessary anywhere and everywhere."

[Kiri]
"...I do not understand the meaning of your words."

[Taichi]
"I'm not ridiculing you here!"
[Taichi]
"Just, up until now, there's never been your kind of type around me."
//This only also refers to tsunderes. Only 'also'. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so you say."

Looking over, Yutaka had fallen asleep while still sitting.
//Juuust as the conversation turns somewhat serious, Yutaka falls asleep. Were Taichi to have this convenient 'off' switch as well it'd serve as a quick explanation for most of the weirdness here, especially if he can also keep his body moving sort of automatically while he has his flashbacks. Now see CCC3009, CCD1001. -GHS
Just what I expected, my friend. A VIP you are.
And because of that, it seems we can now talk a little more in depth.
//Now he wants him gone... but then again, Yutaka can read him correctly, so he could've just done the right thing both times. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How's Gunjou?"

[Kiri]
"...'how' in what sense?"

[Taichi]
"There's all sorts of types that get put into classes. The type who can't understand your language, the type who doesn't see what's around them, the type that fires into rage suddenly, and the damnably normal-ish types."
//Misato and Miki are the first, Taichi is the second, Touko and Kiri are the third, Sakuraba and Tomoki are the fourth. Where Youko fits? Well, it should be obvious: the second. In other words, she's like Taichi. So very much that. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But all, to the last, have been repelled by society for being unable to conform to it."
[Taichi]
"Everybody there's one of Japan's foremost damaged humans. Of course, me and you too."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"How many humans there that can manage a conversation? How many that can be party to building something that can be called friendship?"
//This "human" was censored in the PS2 version, furthering the idea that it should be left literal as often as possible. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Even if we were to say that a conversation was established, you couldn't even begin to guess what spur would make them explode. Anxiety is always on your heels."
[Taichi]
"For example... someone who, when he hears the sound of glass being shattered, starts being abnormally aggressive. He's right in my class, you know."
//See CCC0011B, CCC0014. Glasswork gets cracked and he grows aggressive, hum, yes he's in Taichi's class indeed. Don't ask him whether Karade is a ripoff of Karate, either. -GHS

[Kiri]
"How is this related to what we were discussing earlier?"

[Taichi]
"You preached justice to me."
[Taichi]
"...you see me as someone who can tell right from wrong, who is reasonable."
//Overliteralized due to how if you still don't get it I don't know what to do really. -GHS

The tiny gap between her eyebrows grew tighter.

[Kiri]
"But I did not mean..."

[Taichi]
"You meant exactly that."
[Taichi]
"You have a problem with my conduct. You point it out and denounce it. It is absolutely unthinkable for you not to come and fix me."
[Taichi]
"That ain't a way of thinking you can bandy around at Gunjou ya know."
//IOW this is her Ultramarine. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Whether you're just dumb, or conversely, you very sharply saw through my character I can't tell."
//Choice of training spot, hypocrisy, being exploited by Miki, and being in love with Taichi and expressing it like this. Touko's nowhere near as dumb as her. In fact, the only one dumber than her are possibly Taichi and, by extension, Youko. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But... it felt like a long time since I've been treated like a human by someone I just met."
//...and yet, by implicitly believing he can improve, despite her Stereotypical Doomsaying Priest attitude, she still understands a little bit of him better than he does. To be able to understand this is the point of the the CS Lewis quote I open the book with. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

She opens her mouth, agape.
When she loses focus a bit, she has the cuteness suitable for a girl her age.
Yutaka's eyes are knotholes indeed.

[Kiri]
"...that isn't what we are talking about!"

[Taichi]
"Miyuki, she..."

Her indignation freezes.

[Taichi]
"She was quite serious... in that regard."
[Taichi]
"I don't know the details, but, it seems that when she starts feeling excessively lonely her symptoms come out."
[Taichi]
"She has External World Agnosia. The outline of the world becomes fuzzy and unclear. Kind of a drug trip. She's the type that'd fall from the rooftop easily."
//http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9353/agnosia See CCA0016. This is exactly what Taichi has. The part about the rooftop is particularly ironic given Yutaka. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Did you know?"

[Kiri]
"...no."

[Taichi]
"I think that she'll end up transferred, maybe."
//Interesting uncertainty. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Eh... what do you mean, transferred...?"

[Taichi]
"That she'll be sent to a proper hospitalization facility."
//This is the only indication that Class X isn't just another classroom. Then again, there's no certainty that Taichi knows, at this point, where she'll be transferred exactly, or even what Class X entails. It could even be "the" Research Building of CCA0013. This may be a plot hole, intentional deception, plot relevant or simply the character hazarding a guess with pretty much equal probability. -GHS

[Kiri]
"But that's..."

Kiri appeared speechless.

[Taichi]
"Come now, it's a school, aren't there hours where we're alone as a matter of course? If all around us there were healthy people they'd worry about it but... everyone's just doing what they can about themselves."
[Taichi]
"Those hours of solitude, what Miyuki hated most, they're everywhere."

For example, after school. A classroom with no one inside.
//Also see CCA0015C. -GHS
For example, the courtyard. The sports track left depopulated.
//See CCA0007. For example, the interior of the broadcast room. In which she was sealed despite Tomoki being right nearby for no apparent reason. Very likely, her condition is similar to present Taichi's: she just daydreams a lot. Later on, however... -GHS
For example, the classroom. There are people, but no one to have a connection or a fellowship with; it is a space of disintegration.
//Do you feel it, beating over your head yet? How about now? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wherever you go there are vacuums, you know."
[Taichi]
"She had joined the Broadcast Club because this in-group was an assembly of people maintaining a sense of self."
[Taichi]
"The Broadcast Club had been established with that intention as foundation."
//Now this is odd. Was this official? -GHS
[Taichi]
"'Cause there's not much activity in the club besides that, you know."

I shrugged my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Making friends is a hassle. But going without making some is unacceptable. Do you know why?"

[Kiri]
"...no."

[Taichi]
"Because they're necessary. Necessary for the rearing of a heart."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Yutaka became a friend. That's a good thing."
//See CCC3030. Actually, see CCZAS and CCD0021. Yeah, he became a friend. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I thought I would also have Miyuki become one. But the way I used wasn't quite the right one, maybe."
//Meaning she is NOT a friend. That's why she doesn't appear in the Cross World: they're not close enough. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But me, outside of that I don't really know what to do!"
//See CCD3003 for this coming full circle. -GHS

A wry smile.

[Taichi]
"I'm really so clevah aren't I."
//They'll call him Mister Clever and blah blah blah Doctor Who reference. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so... that sexual harassment... it is on purpose?"

[Taichi]
"There's an ulterior motive too."

I answer honestly.

[Kiri]
"Ngh..."

[Taichi]
"Me, my rationality's unusually fragile."
//The word typically used for Kiri. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But there's a part of it that is deliberate."
[Taichi]
"I wanted to make that plain girl into one of my memories, that's it."

I took the pot from the tea cozy.
Still hot. They were using a good cozy.
I pour black tea into the cup and drink it straight.
//Further confirming the joke at the start. He has to be used to doing this, given his Tea Companion background, see CCC0000. -GHS

[Taichi]
"We all desire connection."
//See CCD1001. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It's not just the likes of us. Everybody does."
[Taichi]
"Telephone, the 'net, letters, friendship."
//See CCA0017A, CCX0001 -GHS
[Taichi]
"All connections, aren't they?"
[Taichi]
"we dispatch language and information and radio waves because of that expectation that someone'll be there, isn't it?"
//We read to know we are not alone. See CCB0018: much more sensical now. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Me, I don't want to think that the partner I'm touching is just a human-shaped hollow."
[Taichi]
"Therefore I perform sexual harassment. And I will continue to."
[Taichi]
"...you can stop me however much you like but I'll neeever stop forever!"

I drink the cup empty.

[Taichi]
"Try to stop me if you want me to stop. With kicks or face grabs or sixty-nine."
//I think it's the same "arm push" as in CCA0030, so tweaked to fit again -GHS

[Kiri]
"...sixty-nine?"

[Taichi]
"Because if you and me manage to be connected by doing that again, I think it'd be a good thing. It might be annoying to you, however."
//Precise nature of 'that' intentionally suspect. But he's being honest here, even if not to himself. -GHS

[Kiri]
"............"

Downcast,
the girl lost herself in meditation.
Into the labyrinth of thoughts that I pushed her down into.
Thinking over and over the words I lied out,
//Whoops, I toootally meant "laid". Yes, the term is compatible with 'lie'. -GHS
it's just like there's something there that says, "he's hardworking, unwholesomeness notwithstanding".
There was intent to swallow that deceit, hiding it in the very bottom of the heart.
//Ambiguous on exactly what is the lie, see next scene. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I... cannot agree to that."

So said Kiri not long afterwards, resolute.

[Kiri]
"Right now, I have nothing more than that..."

[Taichi]
"Well."

Then that's good.
Being easily deceived is unacceptable.
//Still ambiguous as to what she wasn't deceived about. -GHS
The world is far too dirty for that.

[Kiri]
"Be that as it may, once again, I am Sakura Kiri."
//And from her reaction, it seems she's already getting to like him 'that way'. Ergo, she's seen through his bluff... at some level. -GHS

She bows her head with thorough politeness.

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Kiri]
"I am Sakura... Kiri."

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes. I am Kurosu Taichi."

In the end, it was an awkward embarrassed face-to-face meeting.

[Taichi]
"So then, it's about time I get on the way home, but... Yutaka's still sleeping..."

I rise.

[Kiri]
"Apologies. He is a... frequent sleeper."
//Narcolepsy. Taichi is very likely similar. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right, right, so if want a little enrichment to your heart, do come to the Broadcast Club."

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"But if you come, there'll be fiddling. Come only after having figured out countermeasures."

[Kiri]
"......"

Kiri sneered sarcastically.
And that the first smile of hers that I had seen.
Miyuki was no longer among us not even a year later.
//Leaving this suspiciously specific. -GHS
Having subsequently been acquainted with Miki, it became that her and Kiri came to the Broadcast Club together.
//They haven't joined yet, see CCZRooftop for when they do officially join. That sequence takes place after this scene. -GHS
And further my awareness flies, remembering those days in detail.
//See CCX0001, this scene is very very very important. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, you caaame!"

[Miki]
"Oi there!"

[Kiri]
"...hi."
//Now aren't these two the height of interesting. -GHS

The two were like a pair of flowers as grown in a flowerbed.

[Taichi]
"FLOWER'S!"
//Sic. -GHS

[Misato]
"What is that?"

[Taichi]
"The stage name of these two of course. In the Broadcast Club, a stage name is necessary. Everyone has one."
//More on the Shakespearian All Life is a Stage, see CCC4009, CCD1001. The payoff is simple, but quite important. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ohhh〜."

[Tomoki]
"Again those liNGH!"

Halfway through saying lies he was struck down somehow.
//Lack of quotes seems significant. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tomoki is Immoral, Sakuraba is Mistah Vigilante, and I am The Aristocrat of Love."
//Ai Kizoku. Not The Aristocrat of Pure Love, see CCC0026. 愛帰属 (same pronunciation), Belonging to Love. Clever. Sakuraba's nick is never really explained, or mentioned again for that, but that that's what's Charles Bronson gets called at least in Death Wish 3. Haven't seen the actual movie in Japanese so I can't say more. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Wish_3 No other leads. -GHS

[Miki]
"Is that true?"

[Taichi]
"Extremely so!"

[Miki]
"Show me a conversation with those, please."

[Taichi]
"HEI, Immoral, how's that Siscon condition of yours been doing? Losing heart in having lost your heart to her, aren't you?"
//Ai kawarazu pun. 相変わらず as always, unchangingly / 愛変わらず love-unchanging -GHS

[Misato]
"Shis-kon?"

[Tomoki]
"SHUT YER MOOOOUTH!"

My neck was being wrung.
As the person being referred to was there, Tomoki also seems panicked on the brink of death.

[Taichi]
"...Ah geDDit... unGle... unGle... dyiMg..."

[Sakuraba]
"You are the Aristocrat of Love, so are you dying in love?"
//May be the pun pointed out above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Seems more that I am more about to meet my mother in Heaven due to my neck being wrung with a gLove..."
//会い ai meet 愛 ai love, ay ay ay ay... I think he's still being strangled. Curiously ママン has only ever been used to refer to Yusa's mom, but I can't get 天国のママン to refer to any specific religious personage (though admittedly search results got dominated by Maria†Holic - hmmm - which is 2006 and therefore can't be the reference). -GHS

[Misato]
"Come on! Violence means suspension!"

Mimi-senpai implemented a chop on Tomoki's head.
//See CCC3030. Hmmm, this is the only mention of Taichi and Misato having nicknames, but they didn't have anything in the (later) CCA0027, may be an error. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Ah, ok..."

[Taichi]
"...I thought I was gonna die."

[Tomoki]
"You reap what you sow."
//The Biblical quote works best given the Seeds of Persimmon below -GHS

[Kiri]
"...sigh."

All of a sudden Kiri was fatigued.

[Taichi]
"Whassit whassit with that weaknessism!"
[Taichi]
"Don't you know the Broadcast Club is nominally a sports club?"
//For his calisthenics, see CCA0005A, CCA0030 -GHS

[Misato]
"...that thing again..."

[Taichi]
"The genteel third years will be happily moving on, therefore Sakuraba-sensei has worrisomely high expectations in regards to you both participating in the club for the purpose of filling that hole."
//See CCB0001. Still guessing he means that Misato is going towards third year, so she'll be moving on towards graduation... except club is flight for her, so she'll stick around until the Training Camp one year from this flashback. Taichi of this time can't know this, of course, so I guess he's assuming she'll relinquish the club within months. Or maybe he's just trolling. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah."

Sakuraba stood like something cool, dangling an empty bottle stuck in his finger in ways seemingly unextractable, and begins to speak.
//Ohhh here it comes. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Today, I would like to hold a lesson with everyone regarding the Kaki, or Japanese persimmon."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaki_no_tane - the term can very nearly translate to 'parable' here, but let's not be TOO explicit... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awesome, sensei!"

[Misato]
"You are cutting off circulation to your finger."
//I admit to not getting the point of doing this with a finger stuck in a bottle. I could imagine it's a metaphor for how he's choking down his own penis, but that seems weird even by the standards of this thing. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"There is a type of seed of persimmon, or Kaki no Tane, that is actually a peanut-based snack usually served with beer. Did you know?"

Sakuraba speaks, ignoring us. Or should I say, unable to hear us.
//THIS! IS! IMPORTANT!!! -GHS
Bob bob steady nod goes Miki.
How upfront.
//See CCA0004 -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"And people that won't accept these peanuts being referred to as Kaki no Tane are unexpectedly many."

[Miki]
"True that."

[Sakuraba]
"But I, myself, do not normally accept that as anything but a deceit. Why do you think that is?"
//欺瞞, same word Taichi used in the scene above. Remember that Sakuraba understands everything, whether he understands that or not. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, because certain peanuts are called Seeds of Persimmon, that would mean there are necessarily some peanuts that are of the genus of persimmon, and therefore persimmon trees that grow from these peanuts?"
//The logic is inescapable. The peanut snack are the humans, while the Seeds of Persimmon is the Blood of Christ. Can something that's not even remotely similar even become of Christ on the word of someone (hint, that's God)? That's the point of this parable. The most frustrating thing is that Taichi understands all this but just. won't. get. it. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Indeed. If you don't like that, then go eat actual persimmon seeds. Complaining that in peanut-based Kaki no Tane there should not be peanuts is to undermine the dignity of the persimmon-genus peanut."
//This might make a bit more sense after the cut scene of their drinking alcohol... but considering this has nothing to do with actual persimmon or peanuts, maybe not. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"That's a deceit."
//Starting to feel like this should be translated as "troll". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hear, hear!"

[Sakuraba]
"Therefore, I dare venture to only eat Kaki no Tane made of peanuts that grow from persimmon trees that have grown from persimmon-genus peanuts."
//And this all, somehow, ends up into curry. I used to end that with "because Cross Channel", but I since tried Kaki no Tane, and they're damn spicy - ergo the connection! -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you stupid or something?"

I sober up.

[Sakuraba]
"Do you understand now?"
//... -GHS

[Taichi]
"You listening or not!"

[Sakuraba]
"Sometimes I can't hear well from the right ear."

That is true.
There's no impediment in normal life, though.

[Taichi]
"Your Pulling Power caused me to return to unembellishment, irremissible!"
//Hmmm, see CCA0006, CCA0015B, CCX0001. This may be referring to his admission above that he understands his argument perfectly, even metaphorically, perhaps even better than Sakuraba himself does... -GHS
[Taichi]
"I shall take your first name of Hiroshi, feminize it adequately, and make it in a name fit to be an appellation of Her Majesty the Queen!"

[Sakuraba]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"From this day you will be known as Hirochelle. Hirochelle Sakuraba. Fare thee well, Hi-rochelle."
//This one has point 2 a bit forced, but fits point 1 much more strongly (feminization) as well as satisfying 3. 4 is a bit of a wash, but given that most won't connect Saraba with that anyway, as it's a reference that demands a precise understanding of what Sakuraba represents in terms of interpretation, I guess I can just fudge. -GHS

Language is so much fun.
//TL Note: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX you. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Got that."

[Tomoki]
"No, don't just agree to it..."

[Sakuraba]
"My talk is with this concluded."

Flopping down again, he begins to twist his finger to disentangle it from the bottle.
//There was a bottleneck in here? -GHS

[Misato]
"...seriously, you people."

Collectively.
//Meaning she included them all. Same joke as the one Tomoki'll use, see CCA0007 -GHS

[Miki]
"I learned a lot."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Misato]
"Does it seem like you could get along here?"

[Miki]
"For some reason, I feel alright here. Don't you, Saku-chin?"
//Still on sorta-last name basis. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I was told by the teachers to work with this."
//"Make this work" seems better, but given her personality that'd be an intentionality that doesn't seem to be in the original. See CCC4009: there's difficulties in joining the club, even for them; seems more sensical that the teacher(s) would tell her to 'work with this' in general, not just to get in the club. -GHS

[Misato]
"Well, compulsion is not right, so... if you dislike it here, it is fine for you to leave."
//Paraphrasis: "please get the hell out of here so I can have my escape already" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awww, no waaay... the workplace needs floweeers!"

[Misato]
"...so it seems to."

Should we bribe them? Looking at them, they seem to be still brats, so we should be fine fishing with a lure.
//You insipid machiavellist. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Should we bribe them? Looking at them, they seem to be still brats, so we should be fine fishing with a lure. The Congratulatory Gift for Club Joinance Strategy."
//PCP above, one suuubtle addition. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You passed thoughts through the mouth again, Taichi."
//See CCA0023. Wait, how does HE know?! Then again, right around here things get weird. It's very possible that he's not seeing things straight right now, and his memories are beginning to jumble. See CCX0001: a scene like this is right how it begins. -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Hum, these would be right."

From the Taichi Bag I extract but two [ITEM]s.
//Equippable RPG objects, not random items. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Private 『Mountain Witch * Yamanba』 Miki!"
//山姥. This is, naturally, wholly unimportant for the alien magician of words that's a Harry Potter and Charmed reference with supernatural powers derived from reset avoidance who is also the pupil turned villain and an angel or maybe Lucifer and gets crucified for destroying the Tower of Bab-- friends. This is never going to sound credible, is it. -GHS

[Miki]
"Oss, this is Yaman-O-be. Yes!"

One of the [ITEM]s is an elegant colored card.

[Taichi]
"For you, from that superstar turned plastic surgery expert, that Mild Robot who just a bit loves 'em mischievous little boys, Mic**el Jack**n's---
//The origin of the MateBook game? http://www.theoldrobots.com/smallbot43e.html it's really just called Mild Robot. Yes, he just called MJ a pedo. Lolicon is a Disease, Michael! Well, it's dated material anyway. -GHS

[Miki]
"A-, autograph card?!"

[Taichi]
"...most fervent admirer and heartfelt inspiree, the autograph of the 『Aristocrat of Love * Kurosu Taichi』."
//Full sentence is "From that Michael Jackson's inspiree, the autograph of Kurosu Taichi". Yeah, grammar's forced. -GHS

I impose it on her.

[Miki]
"(Ayaya)"

[Taichi]
"(Oyoyo)"
//I can't find much credible on this pair. They seem to just be cutesy sounds. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Next, Private Sakura Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"To you, from the Big Man who is right now baseball himself, Ba*e Luth's---
//See CCA0025B. Intentional mislomanization. AFAIK 'bikkuman' is just an alternate transliterating for big man (instead of bigguman), except... http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%80%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A4%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%89%E6%98%A0%E5%83%8F Look who's down there. -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"You are presented with a Taichi Doll."
//See CCC0000, CCC3025. Once more Taichi thinks he's the Popular Heroine. Want even more meta creepy? Compare a certain girl in Kana: Little Sister... -GHS

[Misato]
"Those two sentences are not connected are they."
[Misato]
"Really, they are not, not at all."

Senpai, exactly as understandable from her vision magnified by glasses(?), is a person of rules.
//Glasses also literally means discernment, not exactly a small detail with her character given how clearly she sees through Taichi's act (and, by reflection, how Yusa does). I'd almost say "of course", but while I'm aware of the fetishism, I'm still reeling in shock that there isn't a directly sexual meaning in this Japanese word. How many does that make now? Five? -GHS
She appears to feel unease with all that is disordered.
//Which explains her annoyance in CCA0027, which Miki imitates in CCA0015. This apparently random detail is important in the context of the Kiri route, as this is Kiri's behavior as well. Just like everyone's much more tsun in Touko's route. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That was because there wasn't any reaction, so he cut it short."

[Taichi]
"...well then, Sakura-kun. Carry this doll with you always, day in and day out, that you may clasp it to your bosom for it to be your tiny pal on those tear-filled nights."
//It should be most revealing that she does hang on to it. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

So as it will not slip from the hand, I had hung its neck with a cord.
//...not even subtext... -GHS

[Miki]
"Did you make this all by your own?"

[Taichi]
"Exactly right."
//I'd still bet on Youko. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Produceful guy him."
//まめ mamu = assiduous, legume -GHS

[Miki]
"If the peanuts expert says it, it must be cereally so〜!"
//Bounce on the above. -GHS

[Trio]
"!!!"

Me and Sakuraba and Tomoki's gazing faces met.
That was a very pleasing gag.

[Taichi]
"Pass."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah."

[Sakuraba]
"Fine."

We stuck our thumbs up at Miki.

[Miki]
"Eh... what, yes?"

[Kiri]
"......and, toss."
[Kiri]
"What, it won't come off?"
//She's still wearing the wrist strap, isn't she. -GHS

Kiri was trying to discard the doll.
//See below, RPG term. Now he's definitely conflating stuff with videogames. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Waaaity!"

[Kiri]
"Mngh!"

"Dammit", says her face.

[Taichi]
"Were you trying to throw it away? Did you believe you could throw it away?"

Gloating.

[Taichi]
"It is most unfortunate, for 『DISCARDING THE TAICHI DOLL IS UNTHINKABLE!』"
//I should probably force the slowest autoread and have an SFX for every letter for proper effect. This system message is about to become Fixed. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I do not understand what you mean."

[Taichi]
"It's a reeeally important [KEY ITEM] that's what!"
//That's how typically these items are categorized in old RPGs, like kawaii kingdom harts, beath of flam, faunal fantasy and dragon forceps -GHS
[Taichi]
"Therefore, even if you want to discard it, it's impossible to do so."

[Kiri]
"...is it cursed?"

[Miki]
"Bwaaah, then this autograph too!"
//...and she's just playing along... -GHS

Miki tries to toss the autograph out the window.
A voice resounds suddenly from nowhere.
//Hallucination. -GHS
    『LOVE ARISTO ATGRPH』 CANNOT BE DISCARDED!
//it's precisely 2x9 characters, so it fits in the ROM hack. -GHS

[Miki]
"Whmeow?!"

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahah!"

[Tomoki]
"You a Magician or something?"
//See Yamanba. No, this is just him hallucinating. He's probably fast asleep by now. Going with Nasuverse reference, it fits with his Reality Manipulation skills and all. -GHS

[Misato]
"Congratulatory Gift for Club Joinance... it is more like the Congratulatory Curse for Club Joinance is it not!"
//祝 vs 呪. That's kinda weak, nee-chan. But I suppose good ol' Monk had it right: it's a gift... and a curse. -GHS

Front and rear doors open simultaneously.
//So it has two doors like a classroom I guess? This is never clarified. I don't think Yutaka came in from the broadcast room, and Touko doesn't seem to be angry that she was locked into someplace as she justly deserves the damn tsundere amirite amirite. Also this is now a double entendre for double penetration because Japan. -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"'ullo, Kiri came din't she?"

[Touko]
"Seriously, Taichi! Did I not tell you to wait did I not! Whyyy did you go on alone now!"
//She seems in the middle of her too-sticky period, likely not long before the format. -GHS

Simultaneous visitors.

[Misato]
"Ahhh, welcome!"
[Misato]
"Two more guests. Let us serve some cold tea."
//Besides her, that's Kiri, Miki, Taichi, Sakuraba, Tomoki, Touko, Yutaka - seven total. That seems to be as many as she can manage. -GHS

In a flurry to the refrigerator.

[Sakuraba]
"Today the fridge is emptiness, President-senpai."

[Misato]
"Haw!"
[Misato]
"I will go buy a bit, please detain them!"
//Doesn't seem to actually have a positive meaning... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Roger that."
//"Rogering" is a bit too much. -GHS

[Touko]
"Ah, I am fine... there is no need..."

[Misato]
"There is absolute need!"
//Flight -GHS

Her swaying arms flapping around, she vanishes in the corridor.

[Kiri]
"...Yutaka, what did you come here for?"
//What respect Kiri has for Yutaka/bis. -GHS

[Shinkawa]
"Just giving my greetings as far as it goes. Well... gotta be nice to the people who take care of your relatives."

[Kiri]
"Unnecessary. Leave."
//What respect Kiri has for Yutaka/ter. -GHS

She tries to push him out.

[Tomoki]
"You joining the club too, Shinkawa?"

[Shinkawa]
"Eh, I'm in the Baseball Club me."

[Miki]
"We actually have have a Baseball Club?"

[Sakuraba]
"They're playing Baseball Pinball with all they have, even if their entire club strength is three people."
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%87%8E%E7%90%83%E7%9B%A4 -GHS

[Miki]
"...haeeeh, fuanny that."
//Looks odd in hiragana, but that's still read "funny". ...though it probably means more the "weird" kind of "funny". -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's because this school itself is fuanny."
[Taichi]
"Ahhh, Taichi! What the devil do you think you are doing, making arrangements and then standing people up..."
//Same as above. Curiously, she gets very possessive *before* she joins. Or maybe, since this part seems to be Taichi's hallucination, maybe she's tsundere here for the same reason Sakuraba was blonde in his dream: he just confuses future with past. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It is possible to bestow [ITEM]s to people."
//...and that's possibly the reason this is where things get odd. Now he has Touko playing along! -GHS

[Miki]
"Uhm, Kirihara-senpai, I am giving you this!"

[Touko]
"Eh?"

Received.

[Touko]
"What the yuck is this? I can't even release it from my hand?! Eh, is it glue?"

Angry angry shaking, but there's no dropping it.

[Touko]
"Hold on, whaaat's the meaning of this?!"

    『LOVE ARISTO ATGRPH』 CANNOT BE DISCARDED!
    『LOVE ARISTO ATGRPH』 CANNOT BE DISCARDED!
    『LOVE ARISTO ATGRPH』 CANNOT BE DISCARDED!

[Taichi]
"Don't just keep wailing on that Discard command over and over. System messages are annoying."

[Touko]
"I don't understand at all I can't hear any messages!"
//Sorta-unconnected. Very interesting that she can't toss it but she can't hear the chuuni stuff either... -GHS

[Taichi]
"You gotta give it to someone, that's it."

[Touko]
"Than youuu go and take it as your responsibility!"

          CANNOT BE GIVEN TO "Taichi"!
//Ah, that one for some reason goes to read the speaker labels, so it works properly. Never a l33t r0m h@ck3r when you need one, grumble grumble -GHS

[Touko]
"Why even!"

[Taichi]
"If they're not part of your Nakama, then handing it over is impossible."
//TVTropes switched this to True Companions, I won't forgive this!! except at times because that's an adequate adaptation. Hum, this would mean that Miki and Touko are Nakama... or that Taichi makes rules up as he goes, yeah. -GHS
[Taichi]
"You and I are no better than strangers, so you can't hand it over to me."
//It's also the term he uses to identify someone he doesn't recognize as Alter Ego, as when he teases Youko in CCC3012B. -GHS

Pak-pak, she makes her mouth open and close. Just like a goldfish.
//Told you it had to do with arcade games. -GHS

[Touko]
"Wha-, wha-, WHAAAT did you SAAAY!!!"

[Taichi]
"Give it up and become a club member already."

[Touko]
"MokYYYYYYYYYY!!!"
//Also used by Taichi in CCA0030. See CCZAS: she acts very close to the way she does in what is explicitly Taichi's moege hallucination. Perhaps Touko's True Tsundere Period predated their actual relationship, perhaps it's another hint that this part doesn't (quite) happen. -GHS

[Kiri]
"We're fine so hurry and leave! This is embarrassing!"

[Shinkawa]
"But I gotta be worried that this ain't going well ain't I? ...yer so unreliable..."
//Ouch. -GHS

[Kiri]
"This is going well. So go away, we're fine."
//See CCD0021/22A. Nothing good's associated with this. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hu, bustling day today."

Sakuraba muttered with a sigh.
//See CCC0041. Hum, maybe this is meant literally... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Oh, you got the bottle off."

[Sakuraba]
"With the power of soap water."
//He....... washed his hands of it? Of course I assume metaphorical meaning in his having a bottle stuck in his finger, why do you ask. -GHS

Senpai came back in a wobbling waddle, carrying a tray with cups on top.
//Unstable, as her usual. -GHS

[Misato]
"There was no tea, so I poured water in cups and here I aaam!"
//It's all about the form of respecting, not about the contents. She's not so much hypocritical as unable to follow the meaning of the rules no matter how hard she tries. It's still the Christian perspective of the fallen nature of man. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Meaningleeess!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah."

With laughter, with anger,
and quite a bit of a festival's revelry.
It's good like this.
This is what memories were supposed to be like.

[Taichi]
"Look over here everybody! We have trouble!"

The sights gather.

[Taichi]
"A streaker has appeeeared!!!"

I rapidly strip off my clothes.
//See CCA0002. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That'd be you!"

Kicked away.
I hug Touko's butt.
//See CCA0030. Miki imitative behavior. -GHS

[Touko]
"KyhAAaAAAaAAA!?!"
//Ax8 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorta bony innit. I can touch the pelvis. Get more voluptuous you!"
//That's different from Miki's reaction in that script, though. -GHS

[Touko]
"KyheeEEEEEE!!!"
//8xE -GHS

That was a fierce scream.

[Taichi]
"G'buuuh!"

I clung to Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Touched by a maAAAAAAAN!!!"
//ーx7 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Gh'ya'fuuuh!"

[Miki]
"Weeee!!!"

[Taichi]
"G'oooh?!"

[Touko]
"Please have a go, Miyasumi-senpai."

[Misato]
"Eh, bu-, but?"

[Touko]
"If he touches the ground you lose."

What am I a ball now?

[Misato]
"Ahhh what a problem."
[Misato]
"Li-, like this?"

[Taichi]
"Seh'ryaaah!!!"

[Tomoki]
"Last one was especially fierce innit."

[Sakuraba]
"I saw that as special service for Taichi."

[Miki]
"Yamman!"
//Might be a reference, but she might just be copying Kiri here. -GHS

It was fun.
It was fun in every way.
A superior quality memory.
Never want to forget.
//Given that it's a wish, and the time loop/memory stuff, it seems to be ambiguous like this. -GHS
That is what I wished.
