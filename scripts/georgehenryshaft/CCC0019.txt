[Miki]
"I should be going by now."
//See CCA0009C for the whole thing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

[Miki]
"Ah, yes."

Departing Miki turns around.

[Miki]
"Mimi-senpai is resuming club activities, did you know?"
//See CCA0009C. Except instead of implying it, like h does, she is lying outright. Plus she's using a nickname she should not be using either. This Miki's been at this for a while, but not that long. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh..."

The matter of that antenna, was it.
I should just feign ignorance now.

[Taichi]
"Is that separate from... not the Peace-keeping Operation... uhm, the Life Maintenance Club that Tomoki's doing?"
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%BD%E9%9A%9B%E9%80%A3%E5%90%88%E5%B9%B3%E5%92%8C%E7%B6%AD%E6%8C%81%E6%B4%BB%E5%8B%95 veeery interesting he'd refer to Tomoki as the UN Peacekeeping Organization, in the Nations of the World reading. Not the full 生命維持活動部 nor the known shortening of 生存部. Miki *seems* to be in this "club" with Kiri, though it's never really clear if/what they do outside of scouting for their secession attempt, and they don't seem to work alongside Tomoki at all. -GHS

[Miki]
"Well, it's the Broadcast Club's... come on, the Radio station thing."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... from the Community FM station, is it that one?"
//That was the original purpose of the antenna, see CCC0022. -GHS

[Miki]
"It is!"
//Oh, her Yusa is showing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"All that stuff happened so it should've been suspended, right?"
//Yutaka... but the vague implication that runs throughout several scenes is that Misato *never* stopped trying to put that thing together. And then, like Penelope in the Odyssey... -GHS

[Miki]
"She was still putting that antenna together you know?"

[Taichi]
"Whoa, that's daaangerous."

Though it needs be said it was assembled partway.

[Miki]
"She was toddling around, using that stepladder."

[Taichi]
"Toddling, you say..."

[Miki]
"She looked about that dangerously unsteady."

[Taichi]
"...ahhh, you were trying to shock me into acting then."
//Loyal pet dinosaur T. Hesaurus reports that 危なっかしい and よちよち are possible synonyms, so I guess that Taichi didn't understand what she meant in this context. -GHS

[Miki]
"Wasn't I."

We looked at each other's faces and smiled without strength.

[Miki]
"Let's reciprocally do our best to live."

[Taichi]
"Yup, let's."

[Miki]
"Because you gotta think of yourself as precious!"
//This does sound like she's saying "I'm so cute", but why this is so will become clearer in her route. -GHS
[Miki]
"So then."

And with a single raised hand as if snapping to attention, Miki left.
//Best I can tell, すちゃ is this kaomoji: http://kmoji.com/kaomoji/10221 See CCA0004: that may be her promo pose. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But still, club activities, huh..."
