[Taichi]
"Hey! Melancholic ojou-sama!

[Touko]
"..."

Her complexion looked terrible.

[Taichi]
"...are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"What's with you all of today!"

She's immediately offended.
I'm seriously worried.

[Taichi]
"You look off color."
[Taichi]
"Even if there is no hunger, it is most appropriate to confer nourishment to the body."
[Taichi]
"The roots of the body are easier to extirpate than the mind's."
//Doesn't seem like it's a proverb. -GHS

[Touko]
"Keep your big words of help!"
//"None of your business", but given the tone above, this works better more literally. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're good at cooking, if I remember."

Long ago she said so.
//No, she demonstrated that, see CCD2002. Except that was a lie, but I'm not quite sure whether Taichi knows. -GHS

[Touko]
"...leave me alone."

She doesn't want to turn this way.
//もしない...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Just no helping you, is there."
[Taichi]
"Come on, out with that hand."

[Touko]
"...hand?"

[Taichi]
"Hold out your hand."

A suspicion reminiscent of a detective's filled Touko's face.
But a real detective, even if suspicious, wouldn't show that on his face.

[Touko]
"...you just want me to grab something weird again."

[Taichi]
"Eeeh, you phrased that remark as if there was another event in the past similar to what you describe."
//Thorough, roundabout, redundant -GHS

Pah!, I Imaginarily expectorated (politeness).
//Kanji instead of katakana, plus the thing in parenthesis. -GHStillOCD

[Touko]
"Wasn't there now!"

[Taichi]
"...eh?"

I become befuddled and slack-jawed.
//Cursed non-Joyo SFX. http://okwave.jp/qa/q6058780.html seems to fit his behavior in this part, especially his next sentence. -GHS

[Touko]
"Wasn't there now, wasn't there now, all squeeze-squeeezing what you put in my hand, wasn't there!"

[Taichi]
"There were such things as those?"
//Intentional. -GHS

I used an expression as that of a dumb child.
//OH SNAP -GHS

[Touko]
"You playing dumb?!"

[Taichi]
"But I don't remembeeer?"
[Taichi]
"Lies! That face is the face of someone who absolutely remembers!"
//SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
[Taichi]
"What face's even that!"

[Touko]
"The feeling of that thing still remains on my haaa〜nd!"

She shaked and trembled with fear.

[Touko]
"By the way, you! There's also how you put that thing over people's heads wasn't there!"
//http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cKLkUYCigpw -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's just a chonmage!"
//That video was unrelated. -GHS

『Forbidden Technique * Chonmage』
//See CCA0008 -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's common in the mannerisms of aristocrats!"
//Indeed. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chonmage If you don't see it, then you should really consider waiting until you hit puberty. -GHS

[Touko]
"That's the mannerism of a sex offender!!! Whyyy would an aristocrat do that!!!"

[Taichi]
"Because she's more than a bit perverted, that's why."

[Touko]
"WH---!"
//See CCD2002. Who's the pervert between the two? -GHS

Her already pale face went even whiter.

[Taichi]
"Now, using my fingers---"

[Touko]
"Didn't you make me DO THAT YOU BAAAAAAAAASTARD!!!"

RAT-AT-AT-SMACK!
//Following the SFX -GHS

[Taichi]
"CONGRATURATION YOU ARE WINNER."
//He's still an arcade game. -GHS

I fluttered and twisted in the air.
I fell while delineating a parabola.

[Taichi]
"This may be an obligation written in Our soul, but... owww... that hurt..."

Getting up, I sluggishly rearrange the chairs and desks that were scattered.

[Touko]
"..."

Touko had already returned in her original posture.
Her entire persona is like a shape memory alloy.
Is it the aristocratic blood?

[Taichi]
"Ahem, Kirihara-sHan."

[Touko]
"..."

A sigh.

[Taichi]
"Fine, fine, if you gotta ignore you'll just ignore."
[Taichi]
"C'mon, hand."

I grab her hand forcibly.

[Touko]
"Really..."

Pik pik pik.

[Taichi]
"It's like your mommy used to make."

In her palm rolled candies three.

[Touko]
"Ah."

[Taichi]
"You can be at ease. My two hundred million little wonderful lives aren't inside."
//See CCA0026 -GHS
[Taichi]
"They're on furlough! (ULOL)"
//See CCB008B -GHS

[Touko]
"...so typical."

Squeezing,
Touko clasped the candies.

[Taichi]
"If your sugar level levels level should your life expectancy too."

And that triple-use joke should also be forgiven.
//とうぶん doubun -GHS

[Taichi]
"Even if hunger is missing, it is important to make a habit of putting things in the mouth."
//.................................... -GHS

Touko gazed, fixedly, at her fist.

[Touko]
"...you're always like this."
[Touko]
"Pretending to be nice, acting the fool, becoming cold and distant, getting scary."
//See CCD2002. Lady's a hypocrite. -GHS
[Touko]
"I don't get it!"

She covers her face.

[Touko]
"...leave me alone. I'm begging you."

[Taichi]
"Yee-es."

She was angered.
