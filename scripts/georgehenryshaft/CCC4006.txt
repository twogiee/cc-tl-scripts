So, I came to the roof alone and that's fine, but,
what should I do?
Ah, there's Senpai.

[Misato]
"Budda-budda-budda-budda-budda-budda!"
//The Buddha is an actual SFX. -GHS

Training for a Survival Game.
Senpai is lovely when ready to shoot her SMG from the hip.
//SMG was spelled out in Katakana in the PS2 version, another of those changes for censorship(?) that are just beyond mysterious. -GHS
That gun, by the way, is something used in our yearly training camp.
//Which didn't exist until this year, see CCC0002, may be just more sarcasm. Perhaps the idea that the training camp is yearly becoming fixed, like the insufficient bread seems to be. Or maybe these people are so stuck in their behaviors that the training camp does, in fact, happen every year and this mess repeats with it. -GHS
For radios, when it comes to training camp, it's gotta be survival games.
//Because it lets them use a radio...? This doesn't make much sense. Unfortunately this script just seems to have gotten the shaft in editing, as it's got multiple parts that are just off. -GHS
We also have proper BB gun type electric guns.
//You'll shoot your eyes out. No, seriously. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun_laws#Japan More interesting that I can't figure out why he would even bother to point this out unless it was literally a Chekhov's Gun, as a very weird and lateral way to point out the true nature of Kiri's clearly implausible crossbow. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hullooo."

[Misato]
"EH?"

She turned my way.
The SMG bursts water.
//She shoots on sight. Told you Misato's a libertarian... -GHS

[Taichi]
"WaH'ph!"

Direct hit the space between eye and eye.
//Damn, that was a snap reaction! She's a crack shot! -GHS
It's an electric water pistol so the blast power's strong.

[Misato]
"Ah, apologies..."

[Taichi]
"No need, our Summer survival games are limited to water guns."
//Seems to be in response to the question that could be asked above about BBs ("do they use them?"). The further focus continues to hint that the BB guns either had to play a part, or actually do. -GHS

[Misato]
"Which reminds me, a new line of products was released right before the Fall."

[Taichi]
"Way too cold..."
[Taichi]
"Uhm, which reminds me, it has been on my mind, but,"

[Misato]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"Leaving the antenna, without even laying hand on it, is it right?"
//So awesome to read this line with the complete antenna BG clumsily left right behind it. -GHS

[Misato]
"......w-, well, is it indeed."

[Taichi]
"We have been lovingly suckered into Miki's pace, have we."

[Misato]
"She suddenly attacked therefore I unconsciously accepted her challenge..."
//Hmmm, 襲 also means "to succeed in the post", and the Drama CD claims that Misato wants Miki to be her successor. (And then the After Story has Touko there...) Might have that kind of subtext, as Miki de-facto is trying to wrest the club from her. -GHS

And---

[Miki]
"G.I. DIE!"
//Miki, OTOH, is an impoverished country. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._%28military%29 hmmm, last I heard the meaning of GI was very much lost in time. That'd make it funnier with him not knowing what Vietcong means. Regardless, the point here is more Nations of the World allegory, with Taichi as America and Miki as some poor country. Do notice that while 'Fatman' Taichi isn't exactly the hero, and Misato's Commonwealth of Panchiaralandia (...) is morally neutral, Miki's Flatnam (and the Militarized Tsundere Empire of Kiri she secretly sponsors) isn't exactly the good guy. -GHS

She made a battle cry.

[Taichi]
"G.I. we ain't!"

I respond to her fire. Then so does Senpai.
//Odd that it's never hinted he grabs a gun... -GHS
The water guns breathed fire.
* "The water guns breathed fire" = don'tcha worry 'bout it.
//See CCC0006B. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Damn you Vietnam Complex!"
//See below. PS2: "you damn war-guzzling losers!" The word he uses for 'losers' also means "unmarried woman over 30 with child". Ouch. -GHS

[Miki]
"G.I. DIIIE!!!"

[Taichi]
"DON'T YOU CALL ME G.I.!"

[Kiri]
"DIEEE!"

[Taichi]
"Bwah?!"

Crap, am I half-serious or what.
//Meaning not giving his full...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Damn you Vietnam Conscious apes... you will be ones who die!"
//Smells of quote... PS2: "damn you gunpowder-addled apes". That's so damn weak... -GHS

I didn't actually know what 'Vietcong' meant!
//And that's why he's guessing on the 'cong' even if it makes no sense. ...that's my story and I'm sticking to it. More importantly, how does he study, well, anything without learning what Vietcong means? This is more of Taichi's really half-baked knowledge. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ngh, impudent..."

[Taichi]
"And you ain't!"

The lines of fire of the water guns crossed.
* "The lines of fire of the water guns crossed" =
  don'tcha worry 'bout it.

[Misato]
"Suspension, suspension!"
//See CCA0002. You fail at battle cries, Misato. -GHS

[Miki]
"uRy'aaah!"

Again club activities, but...
Despite what I may be thinking, I am unable to ignore the enemy in front of my eyes.
//See CCB0018, very interesting in the optic of this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh, out of bullets (water)?!"

I reload my ammunition from the tank equipped on my waist.
Precisely ten seconds required.

[Kiri]
"...hoh!"

Kiri smiles wickedly,
and complemented that with accurate marksmanship.
//Because she's a sniper. Somehow. -GHS
I do a crouch run.
//Roadie run is not the military term, didn't know that. -GHS
She won't hit me that easily,
but ten seconds are long.
Kiri comes closer, to hit me more reliably,
//Still trouble with long-range attacks. Wonder if it's her eyesight... -GHS
precisely as I finish reloading.
Fire.

[Kiri]
"...ah?!"

Kiri was fell. Nice one!
One more shot.
That also successful, Kiri's posture collapses even more.
Falling forwards, stumbling on one foot, she grasps at the fence.
The fence tilted.
Her whole weight put on it, the fence bends down towards the other side, bringing her with it as it falls down.

[Taichi]
"KIRI!"

I run over.
Will I be in time?
Impossible, not at this distance.
I understood that very well.

[Kiri]
"Ah... eh...?"

The metal fixtures of her uniform go clink-clink.
It's the sound they make as they slide over the mesh of the fence.
It's the sound of something that is sliding off.
In front of my eyes, Kiri is,
Miki is,

[Taichi]
"?!"

extremely quick, I could say.
//This is important in her character development: her lack of empathy is at the very least possible to overcome with time, if not entirely in her mind from the beginning. -GHS
Miki extends her hands. She grabbed Kiri's wrist.
By the breadth of a single hair Kiri has escaped her fall.

[Miki]
"...Kiri."

The arm that had grabbed the fence was torn up by the wiring and was bleeding.
//Notice the lack of reaction from Taichi. -GHS
Kiri herself was still shell-shocked.
//To stay with the military metaphor at this point -GHS
............
Kiri is dragged up.
//Unclear, but likely irrelevant, whether Miki has helped. -GHS
For a while, she stayed dazed and stupefied.
//This seems to refer to Kiri, not Miki. -GHS

[Miki]
"OwChChChCh〜!"

Her bleeding is horrible.
//This switch to Miki is quite uneven. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You gotta go to the infirmary for this... Senpai, if you could be so kind, please."
//I can't quite make sense of this sequence, there may be some editing issues or some undercurrent I just can't see. Taking that he's sending Miki with Misato here. -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes."

[Miki]
"Ah, I'll go to the infirmary with Senpai!"
//Without Misato onscreen, it's a bit clearer that she wants to go with Taichi, as "senpai" could refer to either him or her, but no that much why. Maybe because then he'd remain together with Kiri otherwise? -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh... no good, that is what I... Peke-kun, if you would, please!"
//Misato tries rejecting, then actually concedes? Does she figure out Taichi should not be with Kiri? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ye-es."

[Miki]
"Ah, should I just go to by myself then."
//Miki wants to go alone because she can do this alone, though she just wanted Taichi with her???? -GHS

[Taichi]
"You can't handle this medical stuff you know."
//See CCC4023, Miki has no problems, but other characters aren't supposed to know. -GHS

[Miki]
"Awww."

Blood's also weak point of mine.
//Which is why he wouldn't want to go. -GHS

[Taichi]
"W-, well, we'll do this, someway or another."
//I still don't know how Kiri got out of this without a scratch. -GHS

[Miki]
"......"

Beautiful blood.
A friend was rescued.
The heart did not throb.
//I'm guessing that's the excuse he's going with. The real reason is that Youko is "dead". -GHS
This will be alright, perhaps.
The moment we entered the school building I saw Kiri flopping down, sitting hard on the floor.
//Misato was left behind as well. -GHS
Terror is late to come. Always, ever.
