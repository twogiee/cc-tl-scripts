"Ohhh, smell that!"

The number of guards is pretty low.
There are always around ten standing around, but today it's only two.
//Which are going to be zero in case of off-hour. -GHS
It's gotten hot so, maybe because everybody's mentally cracking up, there's many not attending.
//Should be more evident, on second reading, what exactly this means. Except, on further readings, this is even more suspect: this is a very good explanation for why there's no one around. More importantly, the guards themselves seem to be cracking up in the heat! -GHS
Therefore, even the cafeteria was in many ways deserted.
//Though it isn't totally empty. -GHS
Thanks to that, even menus with a high rate of competition can be comfortably obtained.
Well... using a certain 'connection', they are always easily obtained.
//So, would Yusa's mom have much issue being overbearing to Taichi even if her daughter isn't exactly on good terms with him anymore? From the way Yusa's grown up to be completely incapable of expecting kindness, little things like Taichi trying to push her down shouldn't be much of an obstacle. -GHS
But 'that' is something not to be used.
It is forbidden esoterica.
//This is how he'll describe the Parachute Death Sentence. -GHS
A double-edged sword.
Ahhh, but Yusa-chan's adorable ain't she.
I buy a B-meal ticket and bring it to the counter.
//The voice of Yusa's mom was recast for the 360 version, as there's new lines for her in the After Story. I think they're a bit better, but not enough to bring 'em over. At least they gave her a direction other than "here's a paycheck, the script and a phone number, call us whenever and leave the script recorded on the answering machinet, no hurry" like they did for console Sakuraba, all the way to the new retakes in the 360 edition.

(That now) (skinship?) (if that had been a direct hit...) (death?!)

All fluky-fluky I made use of a Tsutsui Yasut*ka's Nanase Series-like Process of Intrapsychical Expression.
//Can't source an official translation of what I assume to be Nanase's mind-reading power.

"It is the World's Strongest Submission, The Trout Hold (son-in-law clampdown)."
