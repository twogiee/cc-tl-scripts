And then I was awake.
I ascertain the depths of the thicket.
Finally, this will be the last time I use this.
What remains now... is one person.
Hasekura Youko---
It is imperative I be much more prudent than I've been up to now.
I absolutely cannot fail.
...I must not make her suspect of that spirit of rebellion I harbor against her.
//It being an internal struggle, however... -GHS
And then, there is one and only point of difference with what has been up to now:

[Taichi]
"Memories... I don't want."
//But he'll still have them, once he realizes that however it goes, she's still a part of him in the lateral if not literal sense. -GHS

No lunch has been laid.
//That means she knows. -GHS
The pattern is wrong.

[Taichi]
"..."

This makes me anxious.
Behavioral pattern changes... simultaneous with the disappearance of all.
//Which is odd: she didn't change at all when everyone *else* disappeared. Just when the other six are gone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...what's with that."

I click my tongue.
When I had intended not to make her suspect!
Because she is blind to love, and so it could trick her---
Was this so obvious that it could be predicted?
No... there is no element with which she could settle that.
//Yeah, he's sending people back, she's cooperating (see CCD3003, CCD4003 for the most blatant), and she's always said Taichi should live alone with her, see CCD0021. He truly is a moron. Good thing he doesn't have to understand, but merely remember not to forget. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Calm down."

Regardless, let's try going outside.
//HACK This doll is only ever seen in this route, and now this is the earliest instance: right away. -GHS
And there, Youko-chan was waiting,

[Taichi]
"...?!"

smiling.

[Taichi]
"Wha-..."

[Youko]
"Just the two of us."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Youko]
"...hoh hoh hoh."
//Noblewoman's laugh, of course. -GHS
[Youko]
"It's just the two of us, Taichi."

I want to run away.
Instinct proclaims I ought.
//Lit. "alerts me", but keeping the kanji consistent. -GHS
Impulse quickens to hurry, the calmer thoughts grow distant.
Pressure, that's what this is.

[Taichi]
"...and it... makes you that happy?"

If you can't preserve awareness, your voice will break.

[Youko]
"Yes. For I have waited."

[Taichi]
"So you have..."

[Youko]
"Say, Taichi... how about a kiss?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, aaah."

Approaching without a sound, her arms are spun around my neck.
I am caught.
I will be devoured. Greedily so.

[Youko]
"Nmh..."

For a while, I am orally infringed by a trespassing tongue.
//See Kiri rooftop scene. -GHS
A light bite on the upper lip while she part our lips.

[Youko]
"Then, we will continue later."

She goes to leave.
//This sounds like an odd pattern, until one looks back on the Sendback routes. She intends doing something similar, until she Sakurabas him because he's gone down the same path. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah, see you... later..."

I was put off guard.
If this continues, I will stay off guard.
What method can I even use,
against her---

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

And I realize that I had been made to hold a paper bag of sandwiches by the pit of my stomach.

[Taichi]
"I came to school, but..."

I scratch my head.
There is absolutely no one here.
But... I'll just look around a bit.
For some reason, if I don't go to school before noon I can't calm down.
//It has nothing to do with guards coming to pick him up. -GHS
The classroom had fallen silent.
//Round 1) Touko -GHS
No presence of any sort.
Loneliness that made the air seem thinner.
I don't have the confidence to stay here for long.
I left the classroom.
A space bigger than the classroom's, a desolation greater than the classroom's.
//Round 2) Tomoki. -GHS
I sit on the chair I always use.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

I take a breather, despite there being nothing for me to do.
Without electrical services, it is impossible to come into contact with anyone else.
//That's a pretty bad assumption, still. Taichi's far from having solved his problems. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The pace of my life has got to to become much more slow now."
//He's using English. He's not taking this seriously. -GHS

But to be a person is to feel the pressure of hurry.
...what a problem.

[Taichi]
"Nah, before I do that,"

I remember that feeling of tension.

[Taichi]
"...there's her, now."

The antenna.
//Round 3) Misato -GHS
Our conversations about progress while assembly continued.
With Senpai I will also never meet anymore.
Her, and all the possibilities where she would be taking care of this, had vanished back to their place of belonging.
//SYMBIOTism? -GHS
There is a dangerous spot on the fence.
Worlds overlapped with it still unfixed.

[Taichi]
"...a problem of water drainage, was it."
//An apparent long-running mystery solved, as there's no way after Yutaka's death that this part of the fence would not be fixed. Also works if the fence keeps getting repaired between routes and keeps breaking. Except, of course, for a couple of problems: first in CCX0001, Taichi'll destroy it with pliers - if it's already broken, why? Second, how the hell did Yutaka know about it and just jump off the building in front of Taichi's eyes? Well, maybe the latter was just coincidence... of the Miki Route kind. -GHS

However many times it's mended, this one section gets wet, and weakens.
//And another one: what, exactly, gets it wet? Rain? Is there a leak from the water tower? One last: how does Taichi remember all this, when he seemingly didn't know throughout? This is just another detail getting Fixed. Perhaps the fence never even gets repaired; the school simply tells people to keep off the rooftop, and that's all they do. -GHS
The roof doesn't seem to be in the school at all.
//This part does seem to exist nearly in the external world, that's why the antenna can reach it. -GHS
Here, in this boundary with the sky, it's like a different world.
//空の境界? -GHS
Like a wide town street, flooded in green.
//HACK to sky -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

A smoke signal was rising out in the mountains.

[Taichi]
"Ninjas?"
//Well, it ain't indians, genius. -GHS
[Taichi]
"'Cause there's any!"

I strike the side of my head.
//Been a long, long, looong while. -GHS
Seems I still have a bit of leftover optimism mixed in.

[Taichi]
"A mountain forest fire?"

Nah, as far as the possibilities are concerned that'd be...

[Taichi]
"Ah, it's Youko-chan, then."
//Taichi must've gone reeeally slow in the head to recognize smoke signals as a Shinobi thing and not associate it with, oh, the Super Ninja. I suppose it's still part of his Not Taking This Seriously that only sort-of works, along with Taichi Is Youko which would make him slower. But as it's starting to be visible, the execution of this route is poor to say the least. -GHS

Why a smoke signal?"

[Taichi]
"...hah, nh..."

Just moments after I was thinking about my leisurely life, I was off and in a dash.
Truly a difficult road, this.
//Matthew 7:14. Hum, a narrow road and a gate that leads to life. -GHS
I enter the thicket.
But ain't this right next to the hokora?
What could she be possibly doing right next to the hokora?
A crackling sound out from the other side of the thicket.
I wade through, pushing my way forwards.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

They were burning.
They were all burning.
All of them, the records, frolicking in the fire.
//They were burning enough that they sent out a smoke nearly an hour before this, since that's how long this path takes. Even halving that, they've still been burning for over half an hour. That seems a little long for a pile of a couple of thousand notebooks at best, but I'm unsure about burning times, and I'm too distracted by how THE NOTEBOOKS ARE PURPLE! PURPLEEEEEEE WTFFFF to go look it up -GHS
Rationality enters a freeze, but the body shivered on its own.

[Taichi]
"What... are you doing?"

I call out to her, and the reply that comes is so docile that it could be said to be frank.

[Youko]
"...burning them."
//See CCB2009. Taichi's porn takes like an hour to go from existent to not having one leftover ash. And the PTA deciding that Taichi's game was too messy and he should quit it is so creepily appropriate... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Burning them you say..."

But are those things we should be burning?
//Duh, it's combustible garbage! This is again Taichi going uncharacteristically slow in the head. It works far better if he's been at the hokora all along, and he's slowly reasserting himself over his split personality, realizing what he's doing. This is what going all the way Youko does to him. -GHS
Those are... the records that elucidate how we are circling around the same time, are-they-not?

[Taichi]
"Burning those... isn't right."
//see below -GHS

So I said with a quiet monotone that did not remind of the tension of urgency.
Or should I say, I was riding the moralrail half automatically, while as a matter of fact, I was fairly stunned.
//moral-rail. Interesting he has one. Well, of course he's riding one: Youko is Teh Devils zomg. -GHS
A reply did not come. Maybe because the sentence was not in interrogative form.

[Taichi]
"Stop. Stop that."

Killer silence.
All she did was stare, fixed, at the notebooks piled into a mountain and clad in flame.

[Taichi]
"Say now..."

Gradually, impatience returns to the heart.
I swallow down saliva, and shout:

[Taichi]
"PUT IT OUT!"

Thereupon she slowly twists her body around, and stands facing me.

[Youko]
"But they're unnecessary now."
[Youko]
"Taichi's understanding is now something unnecessary."
//Third person's still creepier. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The hell you're talking about..."

Understanding is unnecessary?
//See CCD0021. She's been unreset at least that far, not that it means much if Taichi's been. -GHS
Me, knowing about this cyclical world, unnecessary?
//The world doesn't just revolve, it's cyclical. But that's actually inaccurate, more like, the world is predictable. And what's in the hokora is what allows the prediction. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Idiot! I do need to! Put it out!"

I move, grab a piece of wood, try to smack at that mountain of fire.
My wrist was grabbed.

[Taichi]
"Ngh... why..."

[Youko]
"Don't."
[Youko]
"They are burning to the core now. It's dangerous..."
//"Also, you're trying to put out a fire with wood. You gone totally funny in the head, dear." -GHS

A good amount of time has passed since I first saw the smoke signal.
The majority of the documents had already turned to ash.
A number of torn scraps of papers fluttered up and away, like black stains in the air.

[Taichi]
"You stupid or something, if you do this..."

[Youko]
"Understanding will disappear."

[Taichi]
"Right... and if we were to die, all will be returned back!"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

I've been doing pretty well with myself recently, definitely,
but I have no certainty I won't die.
//Death does not mean death here. -GHS
Illness, accidents... unexpectedly going rampant.
//Rampant towards who, exactly? See CCX0001: he means suicide. And so, the previous rampancy... -GHS
As long as the documents exist, I can understand my position even if I were to die.
//As long as he goes to the hokora. Which is rare and unlikely. -GHS
The insurance against that thousand-to-one event has now become ash.
//HACK back to normal -GHS
I drop the wooden stick. Because my wrist was being twisted.
//And totally not because it caught fire and it's about to burn his hand off. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ngh."

[Youko]
"Because only I should know what is necessary to know."
//See CCD0021. Someone who understands... at the expense of everyone else. She's trying to be Miki. She's never gotten over it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan..."

And that moment I understood,
what her scheme was.

[Taichi]
"...my... thoughts... you've..."

[Youko]
"Understood, yes... because you are so simple, Taichi."
//She probably thinks, in a sense, of doing to him what he was going to do to her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

And furthermore, I understood what she was thinking next.

[Taichi]
"...you are thinking of letting me be reconstructed."

[Youko]
"Yes."

The myself of now,
that is, my volition to survive in this eigenlife is unneeded for her objective, that's what.
This myself that wishes to live alone, memories engraved on his heart.
She herself was going to be among the people who'd get repatriated... of course she'd know that.
But she had acquiesced!
...obviously.
Because, to her, everyone else was merely in the way.
//Oddly enough, despite this, she never really tries to push him into doing this. In CCD0021, in fact, she does the exact opposite. Maybe Youko is growing; maybe it's just a sort-of plot hole. Makes more sense if they're the same person, and she's exploiting what Taichi is doing. The last temptation. -GHS
The only one who should exist is myself.
//Not "me and her"... -GHS
However, that is not the myself of right now.
It's the myself that knows... nothing---

[Taichi]
"Then, you will be living in the hokora."

[Youko]
"Yes, I think I will."

[Taichi]
"If you alone preserve your eigenmemories, manipulating me won't be difficult..."
//HACK -GHS

[Youko]
"Yes, indeed."

It's as she were just checking the answers on a homework assignment.
Her smile was a mannequin's.
//Or a doll's. Same. -GHS
Chilling.
//HACK no need -GHS

[Youko]
"I've also withstood so much bullying from Taichi. I've endured."
[Youko]
"Therefore, this time it's Taichi's turn... isn't it."
[Youko]
"But, I will not inflict painful memories."
//Same as him, otherwise she couldn't delude herself she could stay with him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You sure you can just up and reveal that at me?"

[Youko]
"Yes, this is not something I want to keep secret from Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Because, say, even if the me right now is reset, someday I might just find out the secret on my own, won't I?"

[Youko]
"I burned, so that that would never be."
//Poor Youko doesn't know about Nanaka, i.e. that Taichi remembers even if he doesn't remember. She doesn't even realize how doomed her plan was from the start. -GHS
[Youko]
"In the case of lack of information, the probability that Taichi will become aware of the hokora system on his own is low."
//It was low even with it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

That's for sure.
The very first memo laid there was hers.
//Which nearly literally begs the question. How did she figure it out? Maybe there was a 'bad' diary inside before, which she removed. And how did that end up there? -GHS
I've never been anything more than strung along.
//Still forgetting Nanaka. -GHS
I am hugged, and stared straight in the eye,
all the way down to the depths of my heart.

[Youko]
"Taichi. The world is information, you know."
//Wonder if it's the good ol' silly Subatomic World Is Data pseudo-scientific myth that the Japanese like to trot out at least as frequently as the damn cat in the box. If so, given everything, this'd be another troll. -GHS
[Youko]
"It can be dominated with information, yes."
//支. And that's only theoretically, since it's been mathematically proven that no one can have all the information needed all the time. Is this economic criticism? -GHS
[Youko]
"That's true even in investment, right?"
//...perhaps. See CCB0005, CCB0006, CCB2002, CCB2005, CCC3007, CCD1001. And the bet is that this disaster was under the advice of Youko. Regardless, she no more can read the markets than she can read Taichi. Or understand about MWI. -GHS
[Youko]
"He who is king of information is king of the world."
//Of the physical world. And it'd be only an illusion. -GHS
[Youko]
"I have been living for the sake of becoming that."
//She even wants to take over the world! How damn cliched is that... -GHS
[Youko]
"...and I will live until I have become that."

[Taichi]
"......you should become that, but after this."
[Taichi]
"Wouldn't it be better if you return to the world of origin, and then go become that?"

Regardless, her being her,
just from how the members have been vanishing one after another, I should have expected she would have produced a conclusion on what it was that I was doing.
//Moments before: no elements to judge. Did Taichi grab the idiot ball or something...? -GHS

[Youko]
"Because I've had no other suitable objective, I merely chose to be that... that's not something I particularly enjoy."
//The way she speaks is incompatible with the word "chose", very likely intentionally. See near the end for more on this "choice" she'd have made. -GHS
[Youko]
"I would prefer Taichi over becoming that."
//The lord of him...? -GHS

My cheeks are caressed.

[Taichi]
"...you... have gone mad."

[Youko]
"Your features became like they were long ago. So nostalgic. I am happy."
//Is that the face he looked at her with back then...? -GHS
[Youko]
"Because Taichi of late has been boring."
//Back to third person -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you got talkative, haven't you Youko-chan."

I make a cold announcement.

[Taichi]
"You yourself, long ago, in your era of complete aloofness, you were so adorable."

[Youko]
"...we are equal in that regard."

She laughed out loud.

[Taichi]
"And you yourself got that thousand-to-one. If you got no information it won't be good for you, won't it."

[Youko]
"If on Sunday evening I don't leave the vicinity of the shrine, I will know of the occurrence of the loop."
//That is possibly how she figured it out. But what was she doing there? Of course she means Sunday noon, but it's possible she doesn't understand what the loop is and thinks it's merely gotten night early somehow. It would be so hilarious if she could figure out the entire loop system at a look, but not what is happening nor what it means. -GHS
[Youko]
"Even without foreknowledge, that's not a possibility that can never occur."
//And there's still Nanaka. -GHS
[Youko]
"Therefore, this is perfectly satisfactory."
[Youko]
"And then, our relationship will become Phenomenon."
//See CCC3019A for most obvious, but this thing's been pervading the story all the way from CCA0003. -GHS
[Youko]
"The Phenomenon know as us."
//HACK -GHS
[Youko]
"For eternity---"

With a snapping pop, the raging of the flames completely covered the mountain of notebooks.

[Taichi]
"You are a monster of rationality."
//See CCC3030. Nietzsche calls... -GHS

With a melting smile plastered on it, her face approaches my lips.
//HACK I usually don't slow these transitions as the PS2 version is really slow, but in this case, it's way creepier -GHS
This doesn't fit at all, but epic off-tone is the point of this scene. This is pure stylistic suck. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

I throw myself on the bed, and gaze lost at the ceiling.
I've been beaten to the punch.
It's possible... Youko-chan could herself be living in eigentime.
That's what this feels like.
But how can she?
Perhaps there are other spots of retention, perhaps she lies concealed in the vicinity of the hokora.
//Perhaps she doesn't exist and it's just Taichi fighting his demon. There are no other hokoras, that's for certain. -GHS
Regardless, once the trick to sequentiality is understood, our situations are equal.
//See Miki route. -GHS
Of course, I have been avoiding Youko-chan, and of course the person in question would know.
//Seems an excessively roundabout way of saying this... -GHS

[Taichi]
"This is bad."

My ability to be unserious at any time is a charm point for someone like me, who severed off his emotions at one time to again reconnect with them; however, that means I have a flaw: I am able to be unserious at any time.
//See the new CCD0022A: he broke himself in there. But the point here is that he's about to be way way way unserious. He's about to completely and utterly underestimate Youko in ways that transcend the Idiot Ball. The point would be that he just can't bring himself to truly harm her, otherwise he knows what to do. Unfortunately there's no other way. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hasekura Youko... then."

The probability I would be able of accomplishing her Sendback has become extremely low.
Furthermore, if this keeps up, I will be end up erased.
The reason that I can now relax in my room is that my counterpart underestimates me.
Underestimates me, maybe, or maybe she accurately sees my abilities.
I must seize her by force, and send her back by compulsion.
//"Forced repatriation", heh. -GHS
That is next to impossible.
My counterpart also has instincts comparable to that of a wild animal, and the scope of things she can manage is much wider than mine.
She might have all sorts of weapons concealed on her, I have no idea.

[Taichi]
"...seeerious."

This is truly bad.
The myself of now will vanish.
This is a Craisis of Ai-den-te-tee. A real Pinch-ee.
//Necessary to leave weird, because as mentioned above, he's doing his shtick again. This is why he screws up. -GHS
In short, I absolutely must seize her before the week's out and send her back.
//Did he notice just now...? -GHS
If I wish to remain alive, I have no other choice.

[Taichi]
"...that's impossible!"
//Look at it, he's just retreading what he just finished saying! The problem with this route is telling how much of it is simply poor writing, and how much of it is intentional retread of your typical eroge writing: beat around the bush, retread stuff just trodden, repeat, and in general pad-pad-pad-pad-pad that length to hell. -GHS

In practice, I couldn't beat her even if I were riding in a tank.
//Of course; tanks can do nothing against single persons. Didn't he play Metal Gear Solid??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's say... I use force."
//Oh, this'll end well. -GHS

What are the most likely means and schedule?
//This is where it's clearer we're at step 4) Kiri. Kiri did not take Taichi seriously in the slightest, either, or she wouldn't have walked up to him and dissed him basically at every turn. -GHS
I return on the thought over and over.
//Visuals. Also, meta. -GHS
First of all, the highest probability is today.
As we approach the weekend, I can predict her vigilance towards my conduct will grow more and more.
The number of days remaining decreasing,
= the likelihood that the me of right now could have continuance decreases, that is what it means.
//This redundancy feels so redundant that the Department of Redundancy Department refused to touch it. That equals in symbol is just wow. He's just rationalizing charging blindly at her and hoping it works. Also see CCX0001, right at the start. Not the first time he does this: see CCD1001, CCC4021. -GHS
If we put that to numbers, and keep in mind the greatest of possibilities... today is the most suitable for a surprise attack.
//The 7th is the greatest probability... -GHS
If there is one day when she could let her guard down, that would be today.
//*chew* *chew* *chew* -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

But the time for preparations is almost, but not quite, available.
What do I need to be ready for a surprise attack?
First of all... a place to imprison her is required, up until the Sunday when Sendback is possible.
This is a confinement.

[Taichi]
"A weapon..."

What kind of weapon even.
A weapon that can oppose her.
Killing is not something I can do.
After Sendback, she will be living within the continuous time she had.
If I don't send her back to the other side in the current, living condition, it will have been a waste.
//Alive, but also SHE needs to remember (not him). He could just kill her and do it next week, when she doesn't remember. This makes more sense if killing her and making her forget is simply impossible, as he's her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Incapacitation... then."

Something to temporarily incapacitate her.

[Taichi]
"A stun gun, maybe, or something."

I'm sure I have a Myotron.
//http://thepopcorntrick.blogspot.it/2009/10/myotron-greatest-infomercial-you-will.html Perfectly period-accurate, and also Made in Taiwan. Precisely the kind of useless crap Taichi (and Youko) would fall for. Not censored in the PS2 edition...? -GHS
I ransack the room.
I find it quickly.
A Myotron is sort of a high quietness stun gun, that on contact with the opponent is capable of intercepting their very brain waves.
//You really gotta watch the infomercials to understand how hilarious this line really is, as well as how it ties back to the whole Is Youko Real thing. See CCA0015C and CCD0021, to start with. Now, the Myotron is claimed to inhibit the "violent brain waves" of its target; this is not ridiculous in the same sense as associating Dirac with MWI, but it's certainly as pseudoscientific and obviously absurd. Especially since the damn thing doesn't work at all. More importantly, it's difficult to see how Taichi could truly believe that this thing could work against Youko if she were anything more than Taichi's own darker impulses. Which, we'll see, are sexual and not necessarily violent. The description IS removed in the PS2 version. WTF? -GHS
There are individual differences in the effect, but for ten minutes not one movement can be made.
//http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?67261-Stun-Guns-Anybody/page2 "Probably much more effective to clock someone on the head with it." Ouch. -GHS
The problem is how to put it in contact with the opponent, however.
There do exist a few methods of misleading her.
I'll likely be sensed if I try to approach while concealed.
Therefore, I will naively approach from the front...
//TL Note: that means he barges in gun blazing holding something that is worse than a bludgeon. He might just as well take that Idiot Ball and smack himself senseless with it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It'll work, I know."

Settling things like this will be fine.
Weapons with strong offensive capabilities, like a crossbow, are no good here.
//Kiri... if she lost what little sense she had. -GHS
Just to be sure, I also take a spare battery with me.
//The Myotron's battery is non-replaceable, and is said to last decades and thousand of charges. (Obviously, given its effect.) Just what the bloody hell is he even doing?! -GHS
As being suspected means it will all come to nothing, heavy armaments are inadvisable.
//And grind, and grind, and grind that point. I can only hope this is intended to be read as one of those scenes of High Madness. -GHS
Close in on her, and restrain.
Even if I have to cause some sort of injury.

[Taichi]
"...problem is... the time of the restraint."

Of course, in the week until Sendback, she will be confined.
In that time interval, I must take care of meals and toilet.
The danger increases in proportion to the time spent in confinement.

[Taichi]
"But I got no choice, I have to do this."

I got up.
I must hurry and prepare a room for confinement.

[Taichi]
"...good."

Deep breath.
I go to head towards her house.
In the street covered in darkness, I took but one step, and there,
//HACK later stop. -GHS
the girl was.
//She totally called him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
//HACK fade -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

How to even express the sentiments of this moment.
//"I have writer's block (sob)" -GHS
Surprised astonishment and shocked fright mix and entwine, becoming an emotion that yet resembled a thunderstorm.
//Same kanji used for Touko's Big Anger moments. -GHS
And yet, if my behavior falls into disorder, it is all over.

[Taichi]
"Hyez."
//Step 5) Sakuraba... or what he thinks is Sakuraba. -GHS

Approach.
Every step is heavy,
almost physically so.

[Taichi]
"Ya know, I'm sorta hungry."
[Taichi]
"I was thinking, oh how about I go get Youko-chan to make me some of her handmade cooking."
//Truly, no describing how awful he is at this. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Your cooking's so delicious after all, yes."
//And faker... -GHS
[Taichi]
"After all, something warm's better than canned food, you know."
//And faker... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Now that there's no one anymore, being somewhat sweety-sweet isn't that embarrassing."
//And faker... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Well, up 'till now I might just have been a bit cold and curt, maybe."
[Taichi]
"But I'll be more upfront and docile here onwards, who knows, maybe I'll even go out with you?"

Step by single step I close in on her.
A theatrical production not disturbed by but one detail, the myself of always.
//Blatantly fake and thinking it perfect: I agree. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, right, if you wanna you can come back to my home, no problem."
//He's just so transparently awful it's almost cute. -GHS
[Taichi]
"So we'll be living together, the two of us."
[Taichi]
"Just like it was long ago, except our daily lives won't be as despairful as they were back then."
[Taichi]
"Just the the two of us."

The dim light clothes her as a veil, and her lips alone shine pale and white in the bright of the moon.
In a smile.
The muscles along my spine feel like they're freezing.
Why was she here?
//NOW he notices??? Did he grow full-on retard? -GHS
And as I think over that question, I feel overwhelmed to the point of nearly fainting.
If she kills me as I am now---
Next week, she will come into possession of a myself that knows nothing, and therefore...

[Taichi]
"Therefore..."
[Taichi]
"I, you... ever since back then."
[Taichi]
"Since we were children..."
//Unspecified, it might be anything. -GHS

I was at the limit.
I sprung to motion,
running,
pretending to stumble, grabbing a pebble,
throwing it towards her face.
Youko-chan stopped the thrown stone with one hand.
//See CCA0008. -GHS
But now I'm so near.
I strike with the Myotron,
its tip touches her abdomen.
No problem if we get tangled in the force of the momentum and fall down.
Under the momentum of the run I push myself to sit over her.
And then---
//HACK I love how the light above them is way too focused to be anything but a streetlight. -GHS
I had been pushed down to the ground,
//Either the Myotron is totally useless, or it works because Taichi deludes himself it does. Tanaka knows; this has all been intentional. -GHS
and been sat onto the back.
//See CCD1001. -GHS
I'm locked into a perfect arm twist.
I can take not one movement.
//Exact description of the Myotron's effect, see above. Maybe he totally hit her; it happens to be that it's just himself. Of course the Myotron doesn't work - but if this is all psychological, then the believed effect matters and reality is of no importance. -GHS
I am being held down, with my face pushed down on the ground by her right hand.
//This originally said "left hand", and was so in the PS2 version as well. Once again, an applause to the graphic artists' ability to follow directions. "Fixed" in the 360 version, as long as "hand" is now taken to mean "elbow". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

[Youko]
"Come now... Taichi."

A whisper, with the sweet voice of the whisper to a lover.

[Youko]
"There is ideal affinity between me and Taichi, I think."

[Taichi]
"Ngh... ghhh..."

[Youko]
"Who else could survive this long?"
//The rest are certainly dead to this world. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Youko]
"I am no match for you when you become serious, but..."
//Which is the reading key for that ugly bad-eroge dump above I hope. I truly, truly hope. -GHS
[Youko]
"But even when you are like that, I can still manage elude you."
//Elude, not fight. Meaning she'd ignore his attacks, which is what she does when he eg bullies her. She definitely resents him for that, it being her fault in the end or not. -GHS
[Youko]
"A wild beast tamer for a wild beast."
[Youko]
"For Taichi, that's me."

Kiss on the cheek,
then hands on the neck.
They are tightened. My breath is lightly stopped.
//See CCC4021. Was Kiri even remotely killed? -GHS
Just for a few seconds.
My consciousness falls into a darkness deeper than the night's.
//HACK to black first -GHS
Tuesday September 8, 1998 - but getting the dates' gonna be tough here, intentionally. -GHS
HACK different transition -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

Mild heartburn. I was awake.
//Doesn't seem to be aftereffects of the stungun, but doesn't seem related to being choked either... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...it's here."

It's my room."
All the excess had been removed, for use as confinement.
The place intended for Youko-chan was now binding me.
//Why did the idiot use his own room when Youko's room, empty, was just next door? I know, ease of BG recycling, but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"What is even this?"

I ask while killing a yawn in my mouth.
//See CCA0010. They're still all around. -GHS

[Youko]
"...the Taichi of this week still has recollections remaining, therefore, confinement."

[Taichi]
"You seriously treating me as a wild animal ain'tcha."

[Youko]
"Endure for one week..."

[Taichi]
"And toilet?"

[Youko]
"Nappy."
//Wild beast? Try infant. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...seriously?"

[Youko]
"Seriously."

My dignity as person...

[Youko]
"It's alright, Taichi's is not filthy."
//The scatological implications of Cross Channel are also profound. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhm, let's go without talking about that."
//See CCD1001B. Odd he'd feel gross about it, but then again, he's a big damn hypocrite. -GHS

Then I can't even get her to move me to the bathroom.

[Youko]
"Here, food..."

[Taichi]
"You could at least let one hand free."

[Youko]
"Apologies, impossible."

[Taichi]
"......"

I can't do anything.
Because physical strength is necessary.
//He STILL believes the only way to take her down is physically assault her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then, but like this I can't eat."

[Youko]
"Say 'ahhh'..."

[Taichi]
"..."

Humiliated in many and diverse ways.
Well, there's no other people then, shouldn't be a problem...
//First sign of giving in. -GHS
............
I was seriously left alone for one whole day.
//With the everpresent question of what does she do outside of stalking Taichi... -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm beat..."

My back itches.
I can barely switch sides in bed.
//To turn over + to betray. Whoa, that was mean. -GHS
But all I have time for is for thinking...
Youko-chan came along.

[Taichi]
"...what?"

[Youko]
"Water."

A glass is put to my mouth,
and her other hand went underneath my chin.
And just then I knew I was thirsty.
//Suspicious. The irrational Youko part realizing thirst and making him drink before the rational part became aware is a possibility. -GHS
I drink.

[Taichi]
"?"

Something felt odd,
but I drank all of it.

[Taichi]
"Say... was there some drug in the water?"

[Youko]
"A necessary medicine."
//He doesn't seem to suffer any effect at all, and his increased libido doesn't seem to be much at all, considering everything. This may not happen at all. -GHS

No denial.

[Taichi]
"What sort of medicine?"

[Youko]
"Even if I told you you would not understand, I think."
//c.h3@p v1Ag.r@ is sort of hard to read. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Some really bad stuff, right."
//HACK out -GHS

Without a response, she erased her figure.
//AS IF SHE WAS NEVER THERE. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What about foood?!"

Uh-oh, is her strategy to starve me up to the very limit?
Nasty!
//HACK back, different doll -GHS
After a while she came by again.
She had food.
Stew and bread.
That is elaborate cooking for the times we are in.
//Given she managed to bake Anmans, and usually makes complex hand-made sweets and all, I'd say very much not. -GHS
My hunger is piqued.
As I cannot use hands, I'm fed by her.
//HACK -GHS
My dirtied lips she cleaned with her own mouth.
The smell of her body...
It made the center of my groin itchy.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

For the moment, let's take a breath.
Seems like she won't be depriving my physical strength via starvation.
//HACK out -GHS
Taking the tableware with her she vanishes once more.
//HACK back, different doll -GHS
On returning, she had a bucket from which steam was rising. And a towel, as well.

[Taichi]
"What-, what's..."

My clothes are peeled off.

[Taichi]
"Nyooo, you peeerv!"
//Still not taking her seriously in the absolute slightest. -GHS

Struggling is meaningless.
Throughout being made naked, sensitive areas like my nipples also get tickled.

[Taichi]
"I'll be defiiiled?!"

My whole body is wiped with the moist towel.
The face. The rear of the ears.
The arms. The armpits.
The belly. The back.
The buttocks. The legs.
And last... the penis.

[Taichi]
"Ngggggh."

I am made clean and pretty with courteous care.

[Youko]
"...it has become big."

[Taichi]
"For your information, this is not something that happened due to sexual desire."

[Youko]
"Knew it. It's alright."

The towel drops back into the bucket,
and Youko-chan stands straight.

[Taichi]
"Well, what now?"

She gives a light touch to that thing that stands perpendicularly straight.
//PS2 version says his body smells 'grassy', though with a different term from CCC0000. -GHS

[Youko]
"...so big."

She lays fingers onto the frenulum, then runs them up and down from the root to the very tip.

[Youko]
"Taichi's is an imposing one."
//It's a Super Ninja(tm). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

I had become sensitive.
My skin felt all tingly.

[Youko]
"I will use the mouth now."

Her long breath went to mix with the words, and already she was blushing slightly.
A flashing hot gaze was looking through me.
A shiver, and my groin throbs.

[Taichi]
"Normally... it would be the opposite..."
//He's the one that makes her horny then leaves her to hang? -GHS

My stretched offshoot is far fiercer than it always is.
//Offshoot but also "other self", although it's not exactly odd, in this context it's further implications of Youko being his dick. -GHS
I was weirdly aroused.
I, and her as well.
No good, looks like me being fucked is settled matter.
//Heh. -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi... so wonderful."
[Youko]
"Nh... nhMh, nnh, ah, fWah... nh, nnh..."

Her tongue comes in to lick.

[Youko]
"Pch.. pchrh, nh... nnh... nNh!"

Soft stimulation,
repeated over and over again.
//Symboljizzm. -GHS

[Youko]
"Ah, fWah... hrhruh, nh... hruh, hlUh..."

And as I think that the tip would end up lightly held in her mouth, she immediately spits it back.
I was being tantalized.

[Taichi]
"Nggh..."

[Youko]
"fWahnh... nh... nh, nMh, nh,"
[Youko]
"Nnh, nGh, hruhhrhu... aHnh... nnnh."

Lips and tongue entangle and twist as they squirm and wriggle on the surface.

[Youko]
"Pchhh... pch, pchuh... nh, aHfh..."

[Taichi]
"Woaaah..."

A low voice escapes from me.

[Youko]
"aH... hruh... nh, nnnh... pch."

Lips are pushed close, her motion a snakelike crawl.
//NEWSFLASH: Youko's tongue is still a snake. -GHS
The tip of her tongue peeks off of the center line, leaving a damp line on the pole.

[Youko]
"Nhhh, nnnh, nRh... pchhh... nh... you got... all sticky... Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Must be because... you've made it like that."

I squeeze out a pained voice.

[Youko]
"I will be licking it until it is well drenched. Happy?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno."

Just bravado, mine.

[Youko]
"HlhOh..."
//~rero~rero~rero~ -GHS

Her tongue stretched out so much.
Pink meat dripping with saliva, licking from the base all the way up to the tip.

[Taichi]
"Whoa...!"

My dorsal muscles twitch and tremble incontrollably.
This is bad.
My highly susceptible teenage libido is without end.
//Because that's his Demans -GHS
She changes the side she licks, and this loving attention is repeated over again countless times.
//Symbzzz -GHS

[Youko]
"Nhhh, nh, nFhah... nnh... nhfHah...aHnh..."

[Taichi]
"...!"

Shuddering, my body begins to shake. And I can't stop it.
My entire body had become weirdly sensitive.
Am I abnormally excited?

[Youko]
"Taichi's is shaking."
//Sigh, third person... -GHS

Smiling.

[Youko]
"When you feel about to come, say it."
//See Taichi, really. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

[Youko]
"Nh... amazingly hot... nh... and, so aroused, and so incredibly hard! ...Taichi... nnh."

[Taichi]
"Gh..."

It had been building up gradually,
and I come.
...except the instant before Youko-chan immediately distances herself.
She wipes off my pole moistened by saliva with the steamed towel.

[Taichi]
"...?"

[Youko]
"Well, see you tomorrow."
//HACK out -GHS

With a seductive smile she left the room.
//See CCC0000 -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

The overswelling under the clothes was like a tower.
//And that's why the antenna is his dick. ~fin~ -GHS

[Taichi]
"I was half-killed..."

Expectedly harsh,
or should I say,

[Taichi]
"Eh, I'm being harassed?"
//He still sounds out of it. -GHS

That evening, I remained in anguished worry up till midnight.
$SNCCD5001_1 = 1

//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngggh."

It's Wednesday.
Today, I will be having thoughts concerning human dignity.
//The scene with the Myotron was him being meta-silly; the previous scene was him taking Youko unseriously; now he's silly in a more typical way. This is what she means with "being serious". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nggggh."

They were as if to cry.
//ohhh, been a while -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, uwaaah!"

Kicking and struggling.

[Taichi]
"I gotta... I goootta...!"

I try to bend backwards.

[Taichi]
"oUUoUUoUUoUU."
//Now see CCC0025 again. Seriously, what the hell! Hmmm, 王王王王? -GHS

I tremble and I shake.

[Taichi]
"Double You Cee!!!"
//This is a reference to Water Closet, which as we all know, is a VN. No idea what it's named after. -GHS

I yelled out the very contents of my heart.
//HACK NVL mode. Yay total madness! -GHS
             WC. That is what I seek.
        WC. It's what personal dignity needs.
          WC. It accounts for 90% of being
            humane, that's what it is.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
It is as if I could now understand what lays in the interstice between the hardships of the care for the elderly and the dignified pride of the elder being cared for.

[Taichi]
"Ah, ah, I'm wetting myseelf!!! Nooo, wetting my pants gets a NOOOO!!!"
//See CCD1001, CCB0008B -GHS

The door opened.

[Youko]
"'Morning."

[Taichi]
"Your timing sucks!"

Furthermore, she had brought something disturbing.

[Taichi]
"Wh-, what's that?"

She held out the 'products'.
A bucket... and a cylinder of enema caliber.
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"?!? ?!?"
//Wondering if I shouldn't replace ッ with an actual :) for increased weird. -GHS

I cry as I shake my head left and right.

[Taichi]
"My rights, where are my human rights!"
//Doesn't seem like a quote. -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

She looks at me serenely, blushing just a bit.
She lusts?!
//Youko likes rape -GHS

[Taichi]
"Subete no shiri ni heiwa wo (Peace to All ass!) Subete no shiri ni heiwa wo (Peace to All ass!)"
//hee hee snort. 360: "Peace to All * ([Peace to All Full-Width Asterisks]) -GHS

She took the cylinder in her hand.

[Taichi]
"NNOOOO YOU'RE NOT HUMAAAAN!"
//HACK Slower fade from white -GHS
[Taichi]
"UghGh."

Youko came back, bringing food.

[Taichi]
"UghGhGh..."

I was crying in sorrowful anguish.
//HACK new lines -GHS
HACK doll -GHS

[Youko]
"Are you still crying?"

[Taichi]
"oUUoUUoUUoUU."
//No, that still doesn't make all that sensass. -GHS

I wanted to cry on forever and ever.
An emotional scar deeper than even the one at the time of my stock market blunder.
//Part 8/7? How appropriately inappropriate, I guess. ...was the end of the Hasekura Mansion just him making a big blunder on Azuki beans? Did mr. Hasekura lose his mansion to that? -GHS

[Youko]
"I brought you food, yes."
//HACK no fade anymore. -GHS
[Youko]
"Here, say 'ahhh'."

[Taichi]
"..."

The moment I thought I would rebel by fasting, the belly cried.
This is a revolt of the flesh.
//HACK More new lines -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi, let's eat. OK?"

Gently,
my jaw is prized open.

[Taichi]
"Muh gah gah?!"
//Baby noises... -GHS

In the end I was fed, as if I were a baby.
//...for this. -GHS
It was amazingly delicious.
But this did not end with breakfast.
/Taichi: "Go away! Snake woman, go AWAYyyyyyCoRmOrAnTyWaRwIcKyyyyyyyyyy---"
///Snake Woman is the interesting part, but the weird stuff reminds more of CCC3010, the Miki earpick scene. -GHS
/This is the Hellish Heaven (the pain due to pleasant feelings)!
///Heaven and hell simultaneously, this also reminds of that script. -GHS
Her sight focuses onto my groin.
Naturally, it stood towering.

[Youko]
"...is this morningwood?"

[Taichi]
"Nope, good old Tsukare-Mara. It's just from exhaustion."
//Term doesn't google as it should. Wait, I mean, it googles *exactly* as it should. -GHS

[Youko]
"I shall give you a massage."

[Taichi]
"It's fine, just give it up. Please don't touch my Mara. Just leave it alone."
//That one, however, googles juuust fine... -GHS

She grabbed it.

[Youko]
"...so hot, it's like it'll scald me..."

[Taichi]
"Well then, do as you please."

Squeezed.

[Taichi]
"~~~!"

[Youko]
"How is it?"

[Taichi]
"Nice weather we got today."

The speed of her strokes increases.

[Taichi]
"...ngh."

The flame of carnality that was abandoned at half strength yesterday fires up again in a single instant.
A numbness on the spinal muscles that resembled a bout of shivers.

[Youko]
"There is something leaking off the tip... extremely stimulating..."

She stretches out her long tongue, and scooped out on the tip alone.

[Youko]
"Schlkh!"

[Taichi]
"...nOh."
//I think it still means no. -GHS

She gives a soft puddingishly soft kneading to my testicles.
//Why does やわやわ google to a train too? Yeah, I could investigate, but I'm afraid of getting the Trainotakus. -GHS

[Youko]
"...bitter."

[Taichi]
"You stupid or something?"

I am grasped with strength.
A grip on par with a man's.
//HINT HINT -GHS

[Taichi]
"UwAhwAh!"

[Youko]
"'Stupid', you said."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, so I did."

[Youko]
"That wounds me..."

[Taichi]
"Liar."

And she goes downhearted. All act.

[Taichi]
"I wish you would cease messing around with my penis this instant, and depart this room!"
//Nanaka-ish. -GHS

[Youko]
"This part is not saying anything of the sort."

Schlpop, schlpop.
//... -GHS
It's like the little squeaky sound when writing on a whiteboard with a marker pen.
//Damn that's a specific sound. -GHS

[Taichi]
"My penis would never emit a 'schlpop, schlpop' sound like that!"

Schlpop, schlpop, schlpop, schlpop!
//Total times the term was mentioned: x8 -GHS
It's emitting it quite a lot.

[Taichi]
"Ngaaah!"

Her massaging motion is skillful. The varying of the angle of her wrist is unbearable.
She varies the strength of the grip as she pleases, to give my a compulsory stimulus like the milking of a cow.
This is bad, she's going to continue the humiliation of before, and once again squeeze bodily fluids out.
//FLUIDS. -GHS
I bit my lips to endure.

[Taichi]
"...!"

[Youko]
"Enduring?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe?"

Suddenly I was befuddled,
but I don't have the composure for that.
All I am now is enervation.
//Since he isn't being emasculated...? -GHS

[Youko]
"...is this pleasant now?"

Her fingers wriggle, rustling.
The feeling of pressure revolves around, becoming an anguishing itch.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

She presses on the tip of the urethra with the flat of her fingers.

[Taichi]
"Uguu..."

[Youko]
"Like this? Or perhaps, you like it done like this instead?"

Hyper High Speed Pistoning Motion.
This was very, very bad.
//HACK Can't not NVL this. This is the third-longest single sentence in the VN. -GHS
  The stimulus at the nucleus of the cerebrum
  together with the localized stimulus at the
  genital makes the spinal cord reflex center
  fall into a state of excitation which
  generates a pleasure signal that is carried
  through the nervus hypogastricus to the sexual
  organs in which the prostatic gland begins to
  produce fluids mixed with a specific type of
  Wonderful Cell inducing the phenomenon
  of the outwards ejection of said fluid from
  the tip of the urethra.
//Comedy continues with one of those increasingly rare run-on sentences. The only thing that seem odd are the localized stimulus and the spinal cord reflex center things: the localized stimulus at the genital would still become an electric signal to the brain, and the spinal cord reflex center(s) are also located in the brain, while this sort-of sounds like they're localized. It's not big deal compared to the usual, and I don't see anything else that's relevant, so unless the joke is that Taichi actually knows a thing or two about ejaculation, this seems to be it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Aaah... wait, STOPP'...!"
//Hmmm, he uses that at the end of most Sendback routes. -GHS

[Youko]
"...got it."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"
//HACK out, mimicking the above, as it doesn't work that well otherwise. -GHS

She put away my Tsukare-Mara and withdrew.

[Taichi]
"...eh?"

Powerlessly tied up, I was left with the embers of carnal desires.
//Thursday September 10, 1998 -GHS
And then it became night.
There had been no opportunities for escape.
Being that I'm tied up, that's obvious.
Gnawing on a bit was the most I could do.
But however strong my teeth can be, biting through chains is not going to happen.
//STILL humorous scene. -GHS
Hours flow by in idleness,
heading towards the weekend.

[Taichi]
"...ngh."

Lower back aches.
My body is also flush in a weird way.
Rationality seems to be gradually withdrawing.
//Which is her goal, to completely overwhelm his rationality (the Taichi persona) and have him give in to the instinct (the Youko persona). -GHS
The strength to think grows ever weaker.
This situation is... bad.
And how things that change in the room are rare is very very bad.
//Low external stimulus -> madness. Except he was already sort of mad, wasn't he. -GHS
Even though I can't but think, I am feverish, and thoughts themselves grow uncontrollable.
This is a hellish prison of agony.
Humans, somehow or some other, seem to be incapable of getting used to boredom.
There's also the problem of me being unable to move my body that much.
My heart and mind are strained, and my irritation borders with madness.
The stimulated libido kept going, and it scorches the body without end.
If this keeps up, I'll become a smoked salmon of libido.
//It now became a sorta-pun with CCB2002, which kinda fits despite it all. -GHS

[Tacihi]
"...crap."
//HACK to sky -GHS

This is harsh.
Determinately harsh.
There's no need for torture or anything, I'm sure.
//These lines can apply to both her to what she's doing now, and what he acted in her direction in the past. Leaving ambiguous. -GHS
Just hanging in some blank white room, and leaving things as is would be enough.
//Hmmm, doesn't google to padded cells, oddly enough. But it should mean "without stimuli". Odd "hanging". -GHS
These hours devoid of change must be what continues to gradually wound.
//Particularly ambiguous that he'd talk about her given how much HE is hurt by these unchanging hours. -GHS
The door opens.
Even devoid of consciousness as it is, my gaze still turns to face it.
//HACK doll, back to room. Dollwork was missing for this scene. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

It was Youko-chan.
By now, in this world, outside of her there was no one.
The evening meal had been laid on a tray.
Hunger... aaah, yes, I'm also hungry.

[Taichi]
"Tummy's empty, you..."

What spins those words is a feeble thin voice, as if the voice of someone else.
//HACK out -GHS
And then I was made to eat.
It was curry.
//This is the turning point of the route: from now on, he starts getting serious. Taichi may have spent up until now smacking himself with the idiot ball, but Youko's about to hand him her ass and dare him to give it back to her. True Sakuraba, I summon you!!! -GHS
Its somewhat sweet taste soaks in the stomach.
And then water.
By now I had parted with my sharper senses, yet certainly there is some medicine or drug in it.
//BWAHAHAHAHAH! Curry destroys all drugs! Bow down to it! -GHS
But I don't care.

[Taichi]
"...seconds."

Youko-chan wordlessly brought more.

[Taichi]
"Delicious."

My head was stroked.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
And as this continues,
the thought,
of heedlessly surrendering to her,
and to cast aside Next Week.
//Noo don't give in to teh devils. -GHS
This person that should be me, after all,
is no different from a stranger.
//Seems to be referring to himself in third person. Or to her, since it might just be the same thing. -GHS
No.
Opposition swells.
//This is because of curry, which symbolizes Christianity. I simply cannot be kidding with this. -GHS
The myself of now is incapable of resignation.
I can inherit the volition still preserved
inside of me,
this myself that saw everybody off,
this myself who hid all kinds of memories in
his heart... this myself so like a bomb.
I will make the self precious.
//See CCC4024. Wait for iiit... -GHS
I will persist and continue.
Until that day when the sky itself rots and falls,
//And this is a straight line from CCC0025 to the very end screen, meaning curry and Sakuraba are not a red herring but an important part. -GHS
I shall live through.
           And for the sake of that...
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"A most delicious meal. You may take your leave."

I release... cold words.
//HACK fade -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

She did not depart.
//HACK new lines. This has one line too important not to bring in, even if they don't truly fit. -GHS

[Youko]
"Heh heh heh."
[Youko]
"Love you, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Do you."

[Youko]
"Meanie."

[Taichi]
"Shaddap, idiot."

[Youko]
"'Idiot', you said."
//Unfortunately it recycles a line, as this appears during a sex scene. I'll just change the translation to make it less obvious. Hey, at least I didn't copypaste the same script twice as in that Touko scene in Week 5. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'Cause you're an idiot, that's why."
[Taichi]
"If Phenomenization is what you want, then you could just kill myself as I am."

[Youko]
"But a choice labeled 'kill Taichi'... doesn't exist."
//Scene would continue into something similar to CCB2009, with her smelling him, plus a weird "get off the island!" from Taichi. -GHS

She lays hands on my groin.

[Taichi]
"...hands off."

Naturally, 'it' is becoming ecstatic.
It's bravado.
Bravado to avoid this enervation.

[Youko]
"...so swollen. Like it would burst."

[Taichi]
"And who's to blame for that!"

Her stimulation and the medicine are to blame.
I turn a gaze at her that at cold to the very limit of the possible.

[Youko]
"Then... seems like it's best not to touch here."

She clasps the tip with the palm and rubs.

[Taichi]
"...!"

And immediately releases.

[Taichi]
"You making fun of me?!"

[Youko]
"I'm loving you."
//This is less Ironic Echo and more like Holy Crap She IS The Embodiment Of His Perversions. -GHS

Her face drops in.

[Youko]
"Out with the tongue. I shall suck it."
//See CCD0003 -GHS

I felt like I would ejaculate.

[Taichi]
"...'m good."

I try to turn my face away.
My chin is captured and I am kissed.

[Youko]
"Nhhh---"

[Taichi]
"Nh... nMh..."

She indulges of my oral cavity as she pleases.
The tongue that went to escape is apprehended in an instant, entwined with her long licker,
//Jumpin' jiminy cricket the twist's got moves. -GHS
and tied up with amazing strength, squeezing out the saliva.

[Taichi]
"Nh, nnh...!"

Crap, I'm going all dizzy in the head.
It seems I will end up responding.
I want to cease resistance,
but...

[Taichi]
"Nh!"

I maintain nonresistance.
I... will not... become someone else's object.
While sucking with strength, she pulls out of the kiss.

[Taichi]
"nHmh!"

It felt like the tongue would be yanked off.
In an instant, my head went blank.
This is dangerous...

[Taichi]
"Pah!"

I try spitting out.
//Ollld memes... -GHS
At the very least I must not let my guard be lowered.
And for that, I must resist to my limits for now.
I must make display of exhaustion after this futile resistance.
//Hum, because then she'll leave him alone if she thinks he's had enough? Works equally the opposite way, though. -GHS
One more time, kiss.
It is thrust in a hollow.

[Taichi]
"nMh---"

[Youko]
"Nh, hgh... nh, pch, pchrh... nnh, nh, nnnh!"

A passionate blowjob.
Instantaneously my hips spring up.
It's as if the moisture inside the mouth was being entirely aspirated.
A long tongue that invades to the throat.
Means to stop it, none.
Her hot oral cavity pours heat into mine.
The flavor of the girl's tongue is one I know well.
Entanglement.
//Yay, I made a physics joke. It's not the term used for quantum entanglement, tho, so it's just coincidental anyway. -GHS
Crawling onto me like a leech, driving me mad.

[Youko]
"Pch, pchrh... nh, hrhuh... jYuhrh, nh... nnh, hnh, hfhhh!"

Once in a while she mixes in sucking action.
I get goosebumps.
Her lower extremities touching my groin, alone, gave me the most supreme of sensations.
Love bites on the lips.
It generates but a light pain, scorching my consciousness.
And then she goes even deeper.

[Youko]
"Nhhh, hnh, mHnh... nnh, nAh... pch, pch, phchhh〜..."

[Taichi]
"...!!!"

I almost ended up releasing from the kiss alone.
Sensing it, she distanced from me.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

The knee she has right in the middle of my crotch tries to topple over the towering penis.
The pleasure loses sight of its nozzle, smolders, sputters, and circulates around in the base.
//See CCC0000 -GHS
Maddening.

[Youko]
"You're dribbling drool... Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"..."

I cannot control that by myself.

[Youko]
"...nh... what a waste..."

She licked.

[Youko]
"Drink mine as well."

Lips are applied again.
An astonishing amount of saliva pours in.

[Taichi]
"Nnh!"

And continues, and continues, forever on.

[Youko]
"Nh, nh... nnh, pch, nnnh..."

Saliva...
So much that it feels it would quench my parched throat.
I am made to drink for a while, and then she switches over completely to soft loving oral caressing,

[Youko]
"Pch, aHnh... nh, fwahnh, hrh... nnh, nnnnh!"

with that tongue that had mutated into an exceptional sexual organ.

[Taichi]
"Nh... nnh..."

Refusal is something impossible for me.
The lips grow distant, leaving me enveloped by a sense of loneliness.

[Youko]
"Heh heh, so cute... are you feeling this?"

Laughing.

[Youko]
"...you're feeling this... with the mouth... nnnnh!"

And after one final single lick makes the round inside my mouth, she stands up.

[Taichi]
"Hah, haaah..."

I sigh.
I can feel the loneliness of this so very much.
She rolls up the hem of the shirt, verifies that I haven't ejaculated, then picks up the tableware and leaves.
//HACK couple new nice lines. -GHS
The door closes.
Lonely hours are again coming.
//See CCA0002. Nice. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...FUCK!"

I screamed.
And I realized that it had become night.
Seems I have just meandered about in hollowness.
//So hollowly is a word. Hmmm, not gonna use that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nh..."

And I've been aided to toilet, and I've been made to eat... yes, feels like all that happened.
Is that something that happened today, or something that happened yesterday, now that's indistinguishable.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
A room with nothing with it,
//HACK tweaked -GHS
freedom taken by force.
My consciousness goes white,
as if shrouded by fog.
//Still good ol' Kiri. -GHS
Ability to think... paralyzed.
What weekday is even today.
//~pun~ -GHS
Surely it's Thursday?
//Seems so. -GHS
Yesterday... what had happened?
The lack of variation drives my sense of time mad.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
I'm beat.
//HACK SFX -GHS
The belly screams.
Looks like I'm way hungry.
The door opens,
it was her.
Bringing a pail full of hot water.
Ahhh, it's bathing, right.

[Youko]
"Then... I shall wipe your body now."

[Taichi]
"...whatever you like."

But while the mouth said so, the body had evidence.
//See CCA0012. And around it runs, one more time. He's gotten better with curry, but the "time loop" of this room is making him forget once again. He'll have to drop the bomb. -GHS
The instant I saw Youko-chan, the skin throughout my body bubbled,
anticipating it,
that extreme pleasure that she bestowed in tiny pieces.
She squatted underarm.
Loosening the clothes, she gives a light squeeze to the penis.
The thing, already upright, looked like it would burst at any moment.
But that stimulus is being controlled up to the very breaking point.
I am but played with, still left unclimaxing.

[Taichi]
"Ngggh..."

Lips suck on my unclothed chest.

[Taichi]
"Nh..."

[Youko]
"...nh... pch... hruh..."

My nipples are diligently tortured.

[Youko]
"Nnh... nh... Taichi's nipples, got stiff... pch... nnh..."

[Taichi]
"Shaddap now..."
//tsundere? -GHS

[Youko]
"Here too... hfh... nfh, nh... nnnnh..."

The rod is jostled,
and yet for just an instant.
Inadequate for climaxing.

[Youko]
"...aHnh... nh... nnnh... hrhuh... hrhnh... nhhh!"

The tip of her tongue sweeps through my breast.
As it approaches the nape of the neck, I shook down to the tailbone.
//See CCD0022A. Who had the nape as an erogenous zone...? -GHS

[Youko]
"Heh heh... you twitched right now... here?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Youko]
"Nnnh〜, nnh, nnnnh〜〜〜, nFh, hFuhnh, nh, nnnh..."

Heat tinges my entire body,
but no opportunity for emission is given.
Once more the lips return to the rest of my body.

[Youko]
"Nh, nnh, ngh... nnh, pch... nh, aHah... nnnnnn〜〜〜!"

As she had announced she wiped my body down, with mouth alone.
//...but she didn't announce she'd have done with the mouth alone. Editing error, or is this a hint? -GHS

[Youko]
"...you got all clean, no?"
//See Touko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hah..."

...except for one part, that part.
But in her pattern of always this is where---

[Youko]
"'night, Taichi."

My consciousness sinks into a part I can't tell if shallow or deep, and sways.
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
That girl is there, in front of my eyes.
You who stand above.
The girl that had always maintained herself unchanged was now under strain.
//See below, she was "driven into a corner", though the specifics are sort of unclear. She wasn't raped, which makes it just puzzling that it'd be a sex thing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's bad you know... like this..."

Just a little boy, I... was nervous.
//He's about to be raped. -GHS
Because as she approached, I could feel the smell of her body.

[Taichi]
"Why... this?"

With a bewitching mysterious smile, the girl proclaimed this:

[Youko]
"This is a contract... so that we will die on the same day, we carve it on our life."
//See CCD0001. Or rather, contrast. CCC0000 is looking more and more like the romanticized version than the truth... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Carve?"

[Youko]
"That we will become alter egos."

And then, two tiny shadows overlapped.
............
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
A dream, maybe.
An old dream.
Even these memories have remained, haven't they.
//He can't express the sentiment of being raped, but... -GHS
Definitely, the very first time me and her...
Suddenly, consciousness grew into clarity.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, right... I'm..."

Being confined.
I could see the night sky from the window.
//See CCA0001 -GHS
Today was Thursday, right?
//Seems to be, yes, still. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Escape... if I don't escape, well."

And then, just like always,
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

Ahhh, it had become morning it seems.
Noon... perhaps, maybe.
My sense of time is in the perfect state of non-being.
The time of feeding are shifted each single time for sure, so that I couldn't judge even via the status of my stomach.
//Which brings the question of why. The meta reason is simple, but the actual one is not so simple to guess. -GHS
Whether it is one hour or one minute, they both flow past me bringing equal anguish.
//One minute is the same as the next. One hour is the same as the next. One day is the same as the next. One week is the same as the next... this whole route is a metaphor for the looped life itself. -GHS
And I realize that I was looking at the doorknob,
anticipating a visitor.
//Trying to train the wild beast to human contact, it seems, see CCA0013 again. And it was Sakuraba all along. -GHS
And then I notice:
//HACK dim screen -GHS
I was in a solitude far beyond the depths of the one I had thought of.
//If Youko doesn't exist and he isn't bound to anything, this is him going hikikomori. And not the faux hikikomori of those who still browse the 'net or read or watch TV or have a hobby; the true solitude of someone who has no interaction with the world whatsoever of any kind, not even the relief of masturbating. And also the Passion of the Taichi because Jesus and Bible Game'ses. -GHS
With this number of days elapsed?
And just because I was shut inside a room?
I was being a child, full of excessive optimism.
Living alone, as if!
Getting on with life alone, as if!
Why did I even think that.
//HACK back to normal -GHS
Body's hot.
Rubbing the legs together doesn't give satisfaction to the pulsing in the groin.
The doorknob turns.

[Taichi]
"...!"

I ended up seeing that.
I have no composure left.
//Notice how she's not so much taming him as turning him further and further into a wild animal entirely dependent on her. The contrast with Misato, who sees him as a sort of pet, is difficult to see, but not impossible. Misato still respects his freedom, at least. -GHS
Mutation. Libido. Hunger.
Mixed wants push me into a feverish delirium.
//The revolt of the body continues. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Youko... chan."

My libido, in particular, was already at its limit.
My entire body felt ready to fall apart.
First, I'm made to drink water.
I am processed in several ways.
//See CCD0023 -GHS
My body is wiped with a steamed towel.
The ending, as typical, is her fingers caressing my lower half.
The penis throws up its head in anticipation.

[Youko]
"Twitching on the edge are you... Taichi."

[Taichi]
"......"

Willpower for a rebuttal I haven't.

[Youko]
"Feels like it would be over... in the blink of an eye..."
[Youko]
"Therefore... just one single lick."

[Taichi]
"?!"

The inside of her mouth completely covered the engorgement.

[Youko]
"Nh... nnnh... pch, pchrh... nnnnhn~~, nh, nh... nnnnh...!"

[Taichi]
"Whoa, aGggh?!"

The lower part of my body leaped upwards like an ayugashi.
//Can't miss the mirroring. -GHS
IT'LL COME OOOUT!!!

[Youko]
"There, all done."

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

A deep groan that comes from the bottom of my heart.
Half-killed. It's hell.
//See above. Now he was half-killed... twice. No hell he'll go to. -GHS
I writhe, draw in a knee, lay my forehead on it, grit my teeth, endure.

[Taichi]
"...Taichi... so cute, love you."
[Taichi]
"Huh... eh..."

And then she left.
A toy.
I am... a toy.
//See CCC0000. "They left behind their toys". Wild beast, treated as a doll. -GHS
No, I'm an utensil, dammit.

[Taichi]
"Hah hah..."

A Security Doll, what a laugh---
//See CCD4003, hi Miki. Japanese term for Linus' blanket isn't this, but that's the meaning. It is nothing but desperate co-dependence hers... or is it his on the (possible) dakimakura/inflatable doll that Youko is? -GHS
And then, just like always...
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
Morning came again.
//HACK to sky -GHS
A morning of neither chattering sparrows nor cicadas.
//See CCD6001. Another oddity that was only ever seen 'round Sakuraba. -GHS
A morning that does not feel real,
abiding, like art, in a realm that is neither truth nor falsehood.
//teh zomgs so much SYMBOLISM it hurts. See CCB... ah, but that'd be spoiling it. -GHS
The dream of a butterfly.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi#The_butterfly_dream which is triple ironic: is Taichi a monster who's dreaming to be a human, or a human dreaming he's a monster? And is he being trapped by Youko, or is the trap all in his mind? -GHS
I sighed, for no dream exists that is neverending.
//HACK night sky -GHS
Night.
Darkness therefore night.
The times when I close my eyes are also dark,
and are mistaken for night.
//Definitely his conflation of night with day due to problematic sleeping patterns, more parts of the microcosm for week/day conflation and time loop perception. Every day is identical, with very very minor variations; are days really changing? Also is interesting considering his Woe Me Creature Of The Night pseudoscientific delusion right afterwards, see CCX0001. If he had his eyes closed a lot when he was a child, then was it always dark back then? -GHS
Open them, and noon.
I create and destroy the world every time I blink.
//Create/destroy = day/night cycle, continues the idea seen in CCA00017A. -GHS
I let out a sigh.
A tiny amount of the stress I was made to accumulate made me do so.
//HACK back to room, dark room. -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

Youko-chan was abruptly there.
An illusion?
The smell... of girl.
Reality?
//Better question, were the previous routes any different from this one? -GHS

[Youko]
"What are your feelings?"
//HACK dim screen -GHS

Feelings?
Don't get 'em.
Can't think about 'em.
Feelings and all that stuff---
I think I want them to vanish, but,
I cannot avoid the act of thinking itself.
//It's the problem with excessive isolation. Especially when you have that annoying mind that starts going over things from the moment of waking to the moment of sleep. -GHS
JMP N_SCENE002
:SCENE002
:N_SCENE002
//HACK disable dimming, too. -GHS
And with another leap of consciousness I would come to myself as being straddled.
//Intentionally odd. -GHS

[Youko]
"...been so long... since I've been connected to Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Hah, haah... haah..."

Her feverishly hot nethers glue closely to the tip.
The physical sensation of dew.
//Or of the outdoors. Hmmm, so if he's faux-Russian and the kanji for dew/outdoors is also the abbreviation for Russia, and it's so similar to the one for Kiri's name, then I can conclude with 95% certainty that I'm overthinking this. -GHS
As I casually look up at her, I would see her eyes were shining with something moist.
//The conditionals are probably there to underline how Taichi doesn't feel anything is real, but since there's good evidence that's the truth... say, where did that Extreme Dakimakura go? -GHS
The seven prismatic colors reflect back on her black hair, bathed by the warmless moonlight.
//TL Note: that means a rainbow, but if you got this far without getting why the focus needs to be that, I suggest going back to discussing which girl in Da Capo is more kawaii. -GHS
I am enraptured.

[Youko]
"...now then, come in... just a bit... nH!"

And so she continues, letting a few centimeters penetrate.

[Youko]
"Ah... pierced... feels like I'm being pierced..."
//Did they ever have sex after the mansion? It says they did, and that's what's caused Mutsumi to toss her out, but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, aaah... nh..."

[Youko]
"Well?"

[Taichi]
"...hah, gh..."

Bite down the bullet, endure.
It merely backfires.
I cannot do anything else.
And then, I stop getting why I've even been resisting now.
//Turn the other cheek, Luke! -GHS

[Youko]
"I'm going... nh... to spread my legs... and it'll go in to the bottom...!"

Her words so much like an actress make my thinking swing back a little.
//Taichi's totally watching porn as he screws a sex doll. Or at least, remembering a porn actress. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That'd be... great..."

That a person's words would come out of my own mouth makes me a little relieved.
//See CCA0016. Once again monster<->Youko. -GHS

[Youko]
"No, I want you to say it properly."
[Youko]
"...say you want it."
//This isn't to be contrasted with CCC0000; this is totally the reality of what happened then. It was pure flat-out rape. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Demand it."

[Taichi]
"...want it."

[Youko]
"Want me to do it?"

[Taichi]
"Want you to do it..."

[Youko]
"To the bottom?"

[Taichi]
"To the bottom."
//Matthew 5:39-41 -GHS

It was a mechanical answer, however, she appeared to be satisfied.
//She can probably no more tell sincerity than she cares for it. -GHS

[Youko]
"Then... I go... nh... nnnh, nh... nHHHHHH!"

[Taichi]
"WaUh...!"

My field of vision turned a brilliant white.
The slime covering my nethers felt like it was stimulating the entire body.

[Youko]
"...head, going white, just with this... nh... nnh..."

Seems we have ended up the same thing.
//Complete with "head going white!!1" crappy nukige writing (which is totally intentional here). See CCA0012 again: now that's where things go full circle. -GHS

[Youko]
"So we'll be slow, OK?"

Her hips fall,

[Youko]
"Nnnh, nh... AAaaaaAaah!"

and lift upwards,
and fall,
and lift upwards,
and fall.
Using the vaginal walls, she scrapes evenly on the part of me towering vertically.
//...ooo-kaaay... -GHS
This must be the first time in many years that I have been connected with her.
Mutsumi-san found out, for sure.
//Of course, if Mutsumi simply said "no crossdressing at home", it'd still work. -GHS
Ahhh, with my eigentime, wondering how many years ago that was is meaningless.
Because the real months, the real years, are impossible to count.

[Youko]
"aHnh... nh... slowly, slowly..."

The pressure of the fleshiness,
and the tiny folds on the inside,
send a ferocious carnality into me,
and make me feel as if I was about to climax.

[Taichi]
"Ngh... nnngh.."

[Youko]
"...nh... can't... yet..."

Stop.

[Youko]
"Haaah, hah, hah... hot... belly feels on fire..."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan."

My voice turns inside out.
I had the premonition that with a single slight stirring I would explode.
That mental strain is conveyed to the counterpart.

[Youko]
"Come. In the depths."
//Iii-diot. -GHS

Hips sink in one motion.
Crumbling down.

[Youko]
"...nnnnh〜〜〜〜〜〜!!!!"
//She was holding back as much as he was, meaning SHE was the first to break. -GHS

[Taichi]
"AHHHH!"

[Youko]
"Ah..."

The time of discharge was bizarrely lengthy.
It felt like all that I had saved for so long had overflowed at once,
piercing me from groin to the crown of the head.

[Youko]
"...hah... nh... hot... aHnh, still coming..."

That feeling of spurting so many huge bursts of semen.

[Youko]
"Nh... still... seems to be coming..."

[Taichi]
"Haah."

At last it ends.
Lethargy came by.

[Youko]
"...still totally unsatisfying..."
//See CCA0025C. That part is unreachable with mere sex. -GHS
[Youko]
"We continue... yes?"

My body still hot, my other self still inside her maintains itself solid.
//Of course his other self is inside her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Aah..."

She moves.
I can't stand firm, as I'm unable to use my arms.
//Both literal and metaphorical it seems -GHS
Unable to seize the initiative either, I continued reception.
//See CCD3025. Receive those attacks... -GHS
There's no more time now, I'm sure,
that is why she came to release me.
Because if she did not, then me accepting her... will never happen.
//He seems sooo certain he'd know if he was left like this through the reset. -GHS

[Youko]
"Hah, hah, ah... aAh, nh, nAh, uh... nnh, ah, haaah!"

The love secretions of two people dulled down the conveyance of sensations, but over so many repeated movement, the vaginal pressure felt like it was squeezing out the excess fluids.
Me, and her... lowering muffled breaths, overlapping.
The hand she laid on my abs tickles.
//It's the hand she isn't using to spread her pussy, or to... what IS she doing with that other hand? She can't possibly reach down to the bed to hold herself up... -GHS

[Youko]
"Nhh, ah, ahnh, nh..."

Occasionally, perhaps because I hit the right spot, her throat bends backwards and she coos.

[Youko]
"Nnnh, nAh, ah... hfhah, hyh, aah, kyaaah..."
[Youko]
"Ah... uh... uHnh..."
[Youko]
"Ah! Hah, nh... nnh... haah..."

Our spewed love juices make the lower part of my body wet and so very cold.
But even these trivial discomforts are painted out by the overwhelming pressure.
//See CCA0015C, CCB0015B. So the penis is also shaped by external pressure, not just the heart. ...and the idea that this is exactly the point won't leave... -GHS
Her vagina twisted with strength,
as she screws around her hips.

[Taichi]
"Ah, uh!"

[Youko]
"Taichi... coming, again? Want to come?"

I nod, wordlessly.

[Youko]
"Then, I will be moving faster, so... you can come one more time..."

And just as she said, Youko-chan moved.
Her hair disorder confusedly, and her skin made pale white by the moonlight grows flush in the color of cherry.
//this scene still needs more mysterious limbs -GHS
We have entered Last Spurt.
//Compare to the sentence just above, which is actually sort of pretty; this is an intentionally silly sudden tone shift. Taichi still isn't quite taking this seriously even all the way down here. That's why he'll still stumble in CCX0001, but it's a further hint that the situation cannot be "solved" once and for all and let go, but demands constant repeated daily and weekly struggle. -GHS

[Youko]
"Nh, nnh, nHnHnHnHnH---"

/二度目。
Second time.
My climax was one step ahead of hers.

[Taichi]
"...!"

[Youko]
"...hah... ah, coming, coming... nHH---!!!"

My counterpart matched.
Her posture collapses, and kiss.

[Youko]
"Haah, Taichi... nh... nnnh... pch..."
[Youko]
"Wah... overflowed... amazing..."

Still my erection is unsatisfied.
//And so is her. CoincSYMBOLjizzm -GHS

[Youko]
"...seems you can do it still..."

Our act continues on without end.
It felt like this dull numbness at the edge of climax would become the normal way my penis feels.
How much time has it even passed now?

[Youko]
"Nnh... nh, hah, aHah, hah, haaah... nh... ah... coming... I'm, going again too, going, goiiiiIIIII〜〜〜〜〜〜ng!!!"
//With all the Englishisms and the odd translingual puns at work throughout, which well transcend what is expected of a Japanese work, that Youko would de-facto resort to English in this time of flustering is far more suspicious than when Taichi does (see CCC0041). -GHS

The girl reaches the top, and makes herself into a bow.
//"But it wasn't a cross-bow so I dumped her." No, five bucks say it's actually the meaning of this. -GHS
Her vagina contracted,
becoming the final trigger, prompting ejaculation.
//See? Trigger. Bows don't have them, cross-bow do. It's mathematical science. -GHS

[Youko]
"Hah! Haah, haah..."

Arousal vanished.
//The physical distraction sated, it leaves. The problem is that it doesn't leave Taichi satisfied; it just leaves him free to find real satisfaction. It's profound, if in ways perhaps too silly to be ever taken intellectually seriously. -GHS
And on the very moment, I am made aware of the cold dampness of the sheets under my butt.

[Youko]
"Satisfied, now?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Youko]
"After being teased for so many days it feels so good, yes..."
[Youko]
"Because it's the same for me."
[Youko]
"Ngh---"

//Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS
I'm sure... today is Sunday.
My head felt refreshed and clear,
//That's why he knows the day. -GHS
because yesterday, yeah, yesterday, I had spurted out everything.
When sexual desires leave, rationality returns.
In that sense, it could be said that Youko-chan has made a mistake.

[Taichi]
"...can I remove them?"
//Careful now: see CCC3005. Remove -> eyes -> pretend they don't exist -> the chains are not real. -GHS

In chains, the part that connects to the ground is the most fragile.
I applied continuous strength, but there is no taking them out.
//When/how did she even bolt that to the floor??? Easier if the shackles are metaphorical, I guess. -GHS
And if it comes to this... indeed I gotta use the Joker, it can't be anything else.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
I become melancholic.
This enemy was once half of my own body.
And I wonder, will this still be a betrayal?
//So recurring... -GHS
But... no... no, vanishing would be bad.
It hurts to be sent to the drawing board with my self still undefeated.
//Cough. -GHS
To surmount the self is nearly as difficult as pronouncing the words 'self control', but... well.
//And we come back to that point again. That one scene was blatantly hallucinated; and so this... -GHS
It's because I... hate myself.
And I don't want to lose to a guy I hate.
Youko-chan I don't hate, but,
//Despite being himself. Still no contradiction, as it's just part of him, not the whole of himself. That "no koto" may be read more literally here, as well, meaning something closer to "by the way and changing the subject" instead of being the simple affective reinforcement it usually is. -GHS
I can't but wound.
//He got this far to avoid wounding; and yet the only way he has to get onwards is to do this again. In a sense, he's hurt them all even separating, Touko and Kiri probably hardest. -GHS
She has a weak point as well.
A thrust at this one point will easily led towards a downfall, so it will be a fatal wound.
//See CCD0009. -GHS
I close my eyes. And think,
about the time from the moment we first met, up until reaching the present.
I open my eyes. No indecision.
Sorry, Youko-chan,
I shall be doing something unfair.
//HACK out dim -GHS
............
And then---

[Youko]
"'morning."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"...after I wipe your body."
//Answering his implicit question, which is "when will you leave for the hokora". -GHS
[Youko]
"This is the end, and you want to be clean, right?"

[Taichi]
"..."

And then, once the work was finished, she said:

[Youko]
"This is a farewell."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"To the two of us that have become phenomenon, useless sentimentality is unnecessary... but,"
[Youko]
"...Taichi... I am sorry."
[Youko]
"There is no method to preserve your entire eigenself."
//Hum, she says it as if there was a way to preserve only part of it... then again, since no one's forgotten... -GHS
[Youko]
"Therefore... only this once, at the end."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Youko]
"Come with me."

A supplication.
I was a bit surprised at this attitude of hers.
//Not only she has failed, she all but knows it. It thinks, unlike its Enemy, that it can take by force; but it can't. It can only beg for man to come to it. Unlike its Enemy, its failure is inevitable. -GHS

[Youko]
"Let us spend the same time together, the two of us... until the individuality we have now has rotten away..."
[Youko]
"Eternity it won't be, however."
//Not with her. Never with her. -GHS
[Youko]
"It will become a serviceable time for us, I think."
//For what exact purpose, however, it seems she has no idea either. -GHS
[Youko]
"...Taichi?"

I am thankful for your offer, but,
I...

[Taichi]
"......"

[Youko]
"...indeed."

Accepting the silence as refusal, she let loose a tiny sigh.

[Youko]
"Well, Taichi, see you next week."
[Youko]
"You will not remember this, though."

And then she goes to leave.
My mouth... opens.

[Taichi]
"...wimp."
//Or it would if there wasn't the single most hellish scene in Cross Channel, 150 lines of artless, directionless and incoherent belaboring of the subject with barely a logical connection, let alone a crescendo. But I'm not here to make literary criticism; let's just say I hope it's intentional, because this is the single worst part of Cross Channel. -GHS

On that exact spot she came to a halt.

[Youko]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"I said you're a wimp."
[Taichi]
"And because of that, a traitor."

The face that looked back at me yet resembled a wax model.
//Whether she is literally a doll it matters little at this point. She is in behavior. She's not human and doesn't want to become one. -GHS

[Youko]
"......Taichi."

I show her a smile,
one that contains only a bit of malice.

[Taichi]
"You thought I had somehow forgot, right?"
//Sin doesn't go away with forgetfulness. In fact, there's no forgetting. Even with removing the written evidence certain things don't go away. This, like the Yutaka thing, is important: this sin is before the time loop, so it's beyond its purview, metaphor or not. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That it all had flown away somewhere because of shock?"
//Of her looking at him -GHS
[Taichi]
"...I have memories. Of everything, yes."
[Taichi]
"Or maybe, were you just thinking I would never bring this up?"
[Taichi]
"That it would never possibly happen, because of the way I think?"

I smack these words into my frozen childhood friend.

[Taichi]
"I loved you... I seriously loved you."
//Begin meandering... -GHS

Recollections return to the time of infancy in a single stroke.
//Why isn't this a flashback??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"But the you that I met in the library, with whom I never had a conversation."
[Taichi]
"Head held high with back tense and straight, not associating nor mingling nor crossing with anyone, eyes fixed exclusively on yourself and nothing else."
[Taichi]
"That is the you that I loved!"
//Regardless of whether she ever existed, this herself sure didn't. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Just, I never thought I would want to become good friends with you."
//This is where the contradictions with CCC0000 become explicit, which led me to think that script is a very romanticized version of the events. This script here looks a more realistic version of the events: her teasing and bullying him and then finally raping him when he just couldn't take it anymore. And he was possibly at least drugged. This may also be why he is so certain what he did to Touko was horrible, despite him being far from the only guilty party. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because there was no need for direct contact, that's why."

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"But you were helplessly and powerlessly driven into a corner, and about to be shattered."
//But *what* exactly hounded her so harsh isn't really seen! She wasn't liked by the people of the Hasekura. OK. So get up and get your money and stuff and leave. Why didn't she do that? Nobody cared whether she lived or died. In fact, without Youko being Taichi in drag, there's not much of an excuse here except a relatively limp-wristed "she was a coward and Taichi her means of escape". Even considering her Teh Satans zomgs and therefore weak because of that remains rather disappointing and only sort of coherent. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And that's well, I'm kinda-sorta sympathetic ya know. What happened I sort of know, and at least at that time I was way more upstanding than I am now."
//And more oddities. He doesn't know what happened to her? Meaning all the bullying and teasing and sexual stuff she (maybe) was put through? He didn't ask? -GHS
[Taichi]
"And therefore, what you did was violate an unspoken agreement."
//That borders on the contradictory. More interesting is to remind how Taichi likes things that don't change. As he dislikes the Fall that is intrinsic into every Eden, so he ultimately can't have liked this change in their relationship. -GHS

[Youko]
"...stop."

A weakly, feminine, shaking voice.

[Taichi]
"You called out to me."
//So did Misato. But Misato's was a religious solicitation, as said explicitly; see CCC3025 - "Youko exists in the real world". The two calls look similar, but are subtly different, and it's more Real World vs. Heaven. -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"I was your single solitary ally, right? In that whole mansion."
[Taichi]
"And you came to realize that quickly."

[Youko]
"...how it came to be is unimportant."
[Youko]
"I simply chose you, Taichi."
//This sounds better with the new line above about her "choice". -GHS

Having gotten a hold on herself, she makes the terror in her heart yield, and speaks.
//If her voice never changing isn't troll, it's a pretty big fail. -GHS
Impressive how uniform her voice is.

[Youko]
"I never intended to verbalize the delicate workings of my heart."
[Youko]
"I like you, so I love you."
//This is easier to understand in English: "suki" isn't necessarily love, although it's often used synonymously in Japanese. She was interested and claimed it was love. That's all she did. -GHS
[Youko]
"We are alter egos. It's a bond that cannot be severed."
[Youko]
"That is enough, I think."

[Taichi]
"I don't think that, you know."
[Taichi]
"You... would've be fine with anyone, that's what."
//Yeah, but she had only one, and then again, that's love. So? -GHS
[Taichi]
"As long as it's an ally, and there's competence, whoever."
[Taichi]
"Chose me? Not even close. It was automatic. It was because there was me and no one else."
//So she was fine with anyone... provided that anyone had certain characteristics... and there was only him that had them in her world. So her error was thinking the mansion was still the world, and she had no escape? Would work in a materialistic vs. spiritualistic viewpoint, but this is still fairly weak. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And the outcome of that was... what?"
[Taichi]
"You stopped being self-reliant, and I... became a monster."
[Taichi]
"And then---"

[Youko]
"...STOP!"

For the very first time,
the girl showed a violent emotion.
That is the dominion of fear, Youko-chan---
//I'm not even sure this isn't a pun with the zettai one she has... -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."
[Taichi]
"I have not forgotten, not for one day. Because those are my roots."
[Taichi]
"Alter egos, yes, we certainly made that promise."
[Taichi]
"...but being alter egos means to assert to each other completely."

Inching, Youko-chan takes one step backwards.

[Taichi]
"And that day..."
[Taichi]
"That day when you and I joined hands..."
[Taichi]
"That day when we carefully laid out traps... when we were ready, desiring to go massacre the Shinkawas and the rest..."
[Taichi]
"...that day of vengeance!"
[Taichi]
"That was something you proposed, wasn't it."
[Taichi]
"That was something you wanted to do yourself, right?"
[Taichi]
"The original Youko-chan would have certainly have wanted to do by herself!"
//The only reason I can find for her to fall for him at this point is because it's all decided in the Settei. It's sort of weak to only have a metareason, though. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But you asked it of me!"
[Taichi]
"And then---"
//Start... -GHS

[Youko]
"...wrong, wrongwrong!"
//...Youko... -GHS
[Youko]
"That is... wrong..."

[Taichi]
"That's not wrong."
//...abandon. -GHS

The words chosen were loaded,
//And now we get to the climax, the single worst part of the single worst scene. Let no one call me a Tanakafag or anything here. -GHS
loaded with a bullet that can without fail shoot a beast to death.
//But wasn't she the beast tamer...? -GHS
For the sake of my own self. For the sake of myself remaining my own self. For the sake of tomorrow. For the sake of Next Week.
//HACK the split in the console versions is very conspicuous, so following it. -GHS
For the sake of regretting all kinds of things on Monday of the Next Week, and sinking into nostalgic memories on the Saturday of the Next Week.
And then. For the sake of I and all that I enjoy continuing to be I and all that I enjoy.
//This line breaks my heart and then pisses into it. It's the single worst line of Cross Channel. It's lame, it's pseudo-nietzscheian at this too late stage, and completely misplaced. It reads like something written in the draft, draft which then grew so that the line didn't quite fit anymore, and was kept against all good writing practices. -GHS
For the sake of the very last Crossing, without Meeting, of my entire life.
//And then there's this, which is so much better it makes the above look that much worse. Oh, forget it. See CCD1001 - and everything else. This ruby text doesn't seem to have comedic intent, for once. -GHS
I pulled the trigger---

[Taichi]
"On that day, you didn't even kill one single person."
//Provided she doesn't exist, that means 'she' never took charge then. This would explain why she went on ahead in CCD0022A, but Taichi still had to kill everyone, although not that odd 'we'. -GHS

Hasekura Youko shattered radially.
//WHYYYYY NOOOOOWWWWWoh forget it, I can't stay pissed off at this anyway. This is shattering just like glass does. Hey, just like Kiri, who did NOT break when hit by stones! -GHS
HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"...all of them, I killed all of them."
[Taichi]
"By trap and by fire and by blade."
//See CCD0022A again. Traps don't seem to get used, though we technically never see how the people get killed. But fire? Waitasec, you mean that when he wanted a flamethrower, see CCC3012B, he...? Wow, except translated copies of Dirac's books they truly let the Hasekuras get away with anything. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I was the one that killed all of them, wasn't I?"
[Taichi]
"You didn't do absolutely nothing, didn't you!"

[Youko]
"...NOOO!"

Shouting.
All that is still strong in her is the shouting.
At that time, the one who killed all those people was me alone---
And 100% of those killings were for her sake.

[Taichi]
"...you were just terrified."
//See CCD0022A yet once more: young little frail boy goes from shaking abused little masochistic (to the sadism of S) to murdering ~13 people, building a tower out of them, then displaying it to his worst enemy in a single night. This change is strong evidence that this sequence isn't intended to be taken seriously, although whether that's for the better or for the worse even I can't tell. Despite how the idea was all hers and a very good chunk of the blame hers as well, what he did would've frozen shitless just about any person on Earth. This continues the ambiguity of Taichi's crime, not so much in existence, but in extent. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But that'd been all... that'd still be OK."
[Taichi]
"If only I had been released by you, and let me go back to what I was, that alone would have satisfied me."
//He wasn't being Strawman Saintly in a way that borders the facepalmingly dumb - even considering he's ZOMGS TEH GEESAS; he just wanted the deed done, and all to go back as it was before. In other words, he wanted something that could never ever have happened: un-Downfall. But once the current Eden has Fallen, there ain't no going back; there's only pretending that another Eden is being built, self-assurances that This Time It Will Work, and then watching the same idiocies be performed, all with the same result. This cannot be solved, in the Christian vision, until enough embrace Jesus as Lord, bringing in the end of the world itself. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...but when everything was over... you looked me as I returned..."
//But see CCD0022A: he "broke himself" so as to kill, and in that increasingly savage manner. This continues to balance and make ambiguous the responsibility between the two, until it's at least as impossible to decide as whether Taichi did the deed itself. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And you... you were filled to the brim with terror, weren't you."

My one resentment, my only resentment.
The foundational formative experience of my youth.
Psychological trauma.
//See CCC3003. And it's tied up. -GHS

[Youko]
"...ngh..."

[Taichi]
"Who's 'alter egos' here."
[Taichi]
"Who's 'my everything' here."
//This is the only time these words are used in the story. -GHSigh'n'sob
[Taichi]
"You are the traitor. Mimi-senpai was just adorably cute."
//Aside from the religion/real world of above, Misato wanted to be forgiven; Youko merely wants things to go her way. For starters, she wants Taichi as he was back before Misato and the rest had their way with him. Although unfortunately largely conjecture on my part, she may want him back to the way he was before she broke him at least to ease her conscience about her responsibility in the matter. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Right after I had killed so many dozens, right after I rushed into a domain out from which there is no retracing one's steps, right after I shattered... half of my body, that which I expected would be my sole and only ally... rejected me!"
//This (sorta, badly, clumsily) reconnects to the "assert each other" thing that was dropped about a million lines ago. And weren't there 14 dead...? What's with "many tens[dozens]"? This may be spur of the moment, but... -GHS

[Youko]
"......that's... wrong..."

[Taichi]
"That instant was the downfall of my sense of values."
//Considering he already had serious problems adhering to reality, and had no issue with being treated as a girl - different name included - as well as being first a rapist (maybe) and then the subject of constant ridicule, this is just wishful thinking on his part. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I lost my understanding of anything and everything."
[Taichi]
"My heart became entirely different from that of a human."
[Taichi]
"...and after that... I am grateful for having been raised once again..."
//And what if all the stuff about videogames, eroge, emo, fear of blood, sexual pranks, everything... was all part of her re-education program? This part is too uncharacteristically problematic to be sufficiently reliable, but this could be a wham line. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Thanks to that, I became capable of pretending to be a person."
//See CCD1001: he was a brooding emo who thought himself a monster, as he'll think himself until the end, in fact. Dexter Morgan's father called, he asks what kind of lame-ass reeducation that was! (But do have fun comparing Dexter to Taichi, it doesn't work that badly.) -GHS
[Taichi]
"'I like you', 'I love you'. It's all on paper, sure."
//...this actually works better in the censored version, where pretty much all sex scenes are replaced with words to this effect. But you're stuck with the porn version, so there. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But why, why didn't you just cut me off and cast me away on that very spot?"
//I can only conclude that he seriously believes that would've worked. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That's the one question I really want to ask."

A question to the pupils of her eyes.
//Her pupils are obsidian (KUROsu + YOUko). -GHS

[Taichi]
"My task was done, so I was useless, right?"

[Youko]
"That's because... Taichi... I ended up liking you..."
//The liking that's not necessarily love, see above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"People like you who exist at the very summit don't want anything as degenerate as love!"
//HACK uhmmm... -GHS

[Youko]
"...?!"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you just kept going as you were, you would've certainly become something amazing. You idiot!"
//She's at the summit, but could've advanced and one day become awesome. I don't even know anymore. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Tossing away long hours, preserving me..."
[Taichi]
"What kind of me would you even be satisfied with!"
//Owww failsegue whiplash. Now he's gone from telling her she wasted her time (possibly) to her wanting him to be a certain specific person that he, given how it all turned out, never could've been regardless. I suppose it's ironic given he thought she was something she was and yet could've become, according to him, but I'm not kidding myself that this reads as anything but desperate fanwanking. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Our relationship isn't like the alter egos you talk about."
[Taichi]
"It's not like I need you like I need the skin on my flesh. And you---"
//Should be the (correct) denial of co-dependence, not a total rejection. Left visuals (meaning is just "absolutely need you") given it's still talking about sharing bodies. -GHS

[Youko]
"...STOP!"

[Taichi]
"I don't expect you to really have a need of me."
[Taichi]
"The rebound of that incident, its inertia, it's right here."
//I guess he means that what's happening now was the inevitable consequence of that. Sure, but the real point would be, thematically, that that incident was never avoidable. Or at least its development that way was. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And then you pretend not to notice this rudimentary deceit."
//The deceit of pretending not to notice that they don't need each other? The deceit of him having forgotten? His not being a monster while thinking he's a monster, see CCC3004 since it's the same term in there????? -GHS
[Taichi]
"...will you permit it? That is, is this something you will permit yourself? Well?"
//What the hell is he even talking about? -GHS
[Taichi]
"Is that something that Hasekura Youko will permit herself?"
[Taichi]
"The stage you are confining yourself to, you know, isn't it a cheap and low thing?"
//The problem is that the play between Youko and Taichi did nothing but attract Christianity at least into Taichi's life, who'll never leave him alone until he understands it; meanwhile, this crap here sounds like he's rejecting love in toto instead of just this perversion. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...I'd never think that the Youko-chan I know would ever allow that of herself."

[Youko]
"...Taichi, cease this... I'm begging you..."
//;_; -GHS

[Taichi]
"You made a mistake, you know, when you went to go make use of me."
[Taichi]
"Of this myself that would have become an unconditional ally, until the heart had healed."
//I think he refers to HER heart... but she didn't seem all that heartbroken, or was she? This still makes the barest of sense. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That precise myself, the one useful as a game piece."
//See CCB0005??? -GHS
[Taichi]
"And then, of these eyes."
//What's his eyes got to do with anything? Unless they're Non-Mystic Eyes of Chuuni Ignoring Stuff? Does he mean he could see through her? How? When??? -GHS
[Taichi]
"For you, in that environment, the choice was one and only one."
//YOU GOT [Topic Change Whiplash] !! -GHS
[Taichi]
"Adults were out of the question. Easy to find out."
[Taichi]
"But children, on the other hand."
[Taichi]
"...it would be judged that children could never murder dozens of people."
//This makes more sense if they're Yakuza and the police regards this as an obvious gang fight, ignoring the whole thing, but if so, don't they have the rest of the clan that'd want to sort of ask questions of the two? Ah, well, it's ultimately not important. Let's call it more institutional criticism and leave it at that. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The choice had my name. That was absolutely the correct one, was it?"
//That'll teach dark nukige writers to have forced paths. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Alter egos, that was a contract meant to be engraved on our lives."
[Taichi]
"The hint was right there."
[Taichi]
"It's obsession and pleasure."
[Taichi]
"...you really winced, didn't you."
//????????? Best I can do is that the Alter Ego stuff was nothing but egotistic co-dependence, and that this wincing is an incoherent segue. -GHS
[Taichi]
"On the moment I tore apart the first one, and I was smeared with brains and blood and guts, that's all it took for you to... seriously."
//The censored version of this makes almost more sense here, given it's a quick recycling of the Club's bodies. And they're not arranged as a tower, as well as being in obvious school uniforms. It's just a hasty cobbled-together low-budget thing, sadly, though given how the slaughter of the Club may be just a repeat of the Mansion massacre, with both being of dubious reality, it sorta-kinda works still. -GHS
[Taichi]
"You were unable to make but one movement."
//Myotron'd? Maybe that's why he became unable to look at blood; she learned it from her. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...and then, stopped you were, and stopped you continued to be."
//...symbolism of him becoming an incoherent rambler for this scene? -GHS

[Youko]
"...sto... p..."

[Taichi]
"But I continued to move. What a contrast."
//Because he kept trying to find his own way in life, so yes, symbolism. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because I... used to worship you, you know."
[Taichi]
"I gave it all! Until I became sort of weird."
//CCD0022A now contrasts with this. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And then, one thing we can with this conclude."
[Taichi]
"You don't really like me."
[Taichi]
"...you're terrified of me."
//HACK love how it loads the (incorrect) doll and then disables it. -GHS

[Youko]
"......!"

[Taichi]
"If you are terrified of something, then there are two alternatives and not one more."
[Taichi]
"Erase it completely, or assimilate it completely."
//In this case, kill/ignore, or make everybody your 'half', either physically (which is what he does with his repetition of the CCC0000 pattern), or psychologically by 'absorbing' everyone in his chuuni game world. Which is why everyone has to be ejected from his play world, philosophically speaking there's not an adequate distance between him and the rest. Of course there's more than all or nothing, but whether this is Taichi failing to know or not, once again, I have no straightforwards answer. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That is a matter demanded by a system that exists in the mind."
//He seems to be, as usual, talking out of his ass... -GHS
[Taichi]
"It is different from feelings, it's a system of preservation."
//...but what he's talking about is something intrinsic in human nature. Inability to stay in a proper place is part of the Original Sin. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The self you once had you made corrupt, myself you put into harm, and you wished for a phenomenon."
//All those words back at him, considering the "loop" is his cause whether it's mental or real. -GHS
[Taichi]
"How about... going home already?"
//It works philosophically, home is and remains Heaven, but DAMN this gives the "for the sake of" line a run for its money in sheer clumsiness. -GHS

So I proclaimed with gentleness.
//HACK unneeded. And until now this just poing'd into existence given they forgot to enable the doll above. Because this thing was already so thematically and tonally flowing. -GHS

[Youko]
"......no... never..."
[Youko]
"I don't wanna go home! I wanna be together!"
//Somewhat baby-ish. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because when you have a strong willpower and incomplete exceptionality, once fixated an idea becomes unopposable."
//See CCA0023. So she's stands at the absolute top, and if she continues advancing while standing at the top she can become something amazing, but she didn't, because she's not completely perfect and therefore becomes incapable of changing her ideas, like she did when she decided to fall in love with Taichi after she broke him. In short she's a chick except she's an egg and a piece who can't be resurrected as it'd take magic except there she is therefore magic but magic is a sleight of hand that also requires a viewer meaning detective authority but if Erika doesn't have it no problem she can still do everything 100% even when she can't and still fake-Beatrice can't become a player because that's impossible and therefore certain due to the fact of miracles being about low probability events making them closer to certain. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It completely becomes an automatism."
[Taichi]
"And if you get crushed by your own weight, what then?"
//Uhmmm because making herself important and automatism and uhmmm her stupidity becomes fixed and uhmmm you know what, I'm going with him implying she's fat. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That's like analyzing a monster scientifically, that's what it is."
//A monster is a thing of fantasy, so putting that under scientific analysis would reveal nothing but flaws; cringe-inducing whiplash segue aside, since Cross Channel is religious-inspired fantasy of the Tolkenian species, and all the sci-fi bits are troll for the less careful, this makes sense. Out of context. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Take off the chains."
//What has this got to do with oh who cares IT'S effectively OVER! This was 2x more painful than most sex scenes. -GHS

Youko-chan does not move.

[Taichi]
"I told you to take them off."

Twitch, her shoulders shake.
//HACK out... -GHS
She leaves the room, and brings back the key.
//HACK ...and back. -GHS
Shaking hands undid the lock.
I was set free.
//The chain represent human nature that binds her being the devil (sorry, ZOMG TEH SATANS) and other misc. Christianity symbolism. Except he's still alive so even if he decides to follow Peketianity (???????) it's still not going to be easy. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I will live. Like I am now."
[Taichi]
"Wanna try to stop me with force? Because right now, I don't feel like I'd lose."
//He's been stuck in bed, pumped full of drugs, and driven insane for nearly a whole week. I know this is metaphorical, attempts to drive the readers mad notwithstanding, but Taichi's not taking his dakimakura in a fight right now. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...I don't want to... oppose Taichi."
//Because the above was Taichi's will due to her making pretext and I give up. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Then do you want to be sent back forcibly? Or perhaps, do you want to end this yourself?"
//This line... sob. -GHSob

[Youko]
"But... to go back to a world without Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Should you choose the former, I will forcibly repatriate you."
[Taichi]
"And then, in my heart of hearts, I will be through with you, permanently."
//If Youko's dead, then this is about him forgiving her and allowing her entrance into Heaven from the likely-limbo she was in. There's sense to be found below the garbage still. -GHS

[Youko]
"Aaah..."

[Taichi]
"If you choose the latter, that will not happen."
//Forgiveness is still bound to repentance. -GHS

[Youko]
"...either way... bad..."
[Youko]
"I still, Taichi, you, I---"

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha make other people into a pretext for your own heart!"
//See CCC3012A, possibly above. -GHS

Shouted at, she shook with a twitch.
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS
I lay hand on that shoulder.
//See CCC3019A -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're gonna be living alone, until the day you die."
//This is so much Jesus it makes even me cringe. -GHS

So I proclaimed with even more gentleness.
//PCP above, changed due to no kanji. Kana's gentle and round and also your imouto so stop raping her for five minutes and pay attention, dammit. I can't read this line as being intended in any way seriously, still. -GHS

[Taichi]
"All people do, you know."

[Youko]
"......"

She falls hard onto the floor.
She covers her face, and sighs.
No voice escapes her. She was silent.
She holds down the inner corners of her eyes, as if she were combing her hair with the sole fingertips.
//How do I metaphor? -GHS
Perhaps she's crying, perhaps not.
Motionlessly she but covers her face, Hasekura Youko does.
That was her way of screaming out.
//HACK later leave -GHS
Then---
I brought the dispirited girl to the hokora.

[Taichi]
"But in the end, I will leave you just with this said."
[Taichi]
"I really liked you!"
//Same. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...Taichi."
[Taichi]
"Because I've always been looking at you."
//This part's a little better, but still not by much. -GHS

[Youko]
"One thing, if I may."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Youko]
"...anyone, to greater or lesser extent, will come to like someone automatically."
[Youko]
"Then... how do I do it, how do I learn to love properly?"

[Taichi]
"Don't ask for quid-pro-quo. That's just it."

[Youko]
"......!"

[Taichi]
"The instant you ask for something in exchange, that becomes a business transaction, I think."
//...but... -GHS
[Taichi]
"A barter, a trade."
[Taichi]
"Just a whatever that gives you something that you want yourself."
[Taichi]
"In other words, it's a narcissism that permits trade with the outside."
//*chew* *chew* *chew* *chew*... see CCC3007, however. Was her barter nothing but this? -GHS
[Taichi]
"This is not me repudiating you, OK?"
[Taichi]
"Just, to have become paired that way... made me totally worthless."

A bitter smile.

[Taichi]
"'Tis not friendship alone that demands nothing in return."
[Taichi]
"The answer was right nearby."

[Youko]
"So we could never become something, no matter what?"
[Youko]
"Because I have broken you, Taichi..."
//We can drop her referring to him like he wasn't there now. This is more hint that she would've wanted to un-do all, and that she regrets after all. That's how he can forgive her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Even if I hadn't become an alter ego to you... I would've certainly helped you."
[Taichi]
"And then, this would have reached the exact same conclusion."
//IOW the contract and stuff was pointless, and she could've just simply asked. The way he puts it implies he'd still have gotten broken, but I suspect it just means that they would've been at this point of their lives much earlier. -GHS

[Youko]
"Really..."

She shows a smile, a somewhat tired one.

[Youko]
"Then... it would have been better if I remained a princess..."
//IOW, suck those gender roles and stop making me sammiches. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes indeed."
[Taichi]
"But because at that time you needed something pure to be a shot of adrenaline for you..."
//This makes very little characterizational sense even if considered an Offhand Reveal that's so common 'round here. But perhaps, considering her Princess Carry, see CCD1001... that's what she wanted to be treated as, all the time. Like Touko. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Indeed, the likelihood you'd have used what was underhand, me, was high."
[Taichi]
"But I wish you had just cut me off and cast me away right after using me."
//Already said. And still too whiningly saintly. And still impossible. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because even then, I would have continued to love you."

[Youko]
"Is that not lonely?"
[Youko]
"If you're given nothing from your partner... will it not become lonely?"

[Taichi]
"...what I like is to look at what is beautiful."
[Taichi]
"That's the first thing. Has been all the way from the beginning."
//Nanaka. Meaning his love for Youko (and the rest) was literal Oedip--- sorry I mean momcon. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That very feeling was my very first emotion."
//Followed right after by bullshit spewing, as Nanaka is a religious figure, ergo her teaching that to Taichi is consistent with her also representing the very Tolkenian approach to religion in narrative. See, THIS is awesome. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And so, it'll be alright!"

[Youko]
"...if... you once again were to return to the other side, Taichi..."
[Youko]
"I would try for you again."

[Taichi]
"Sure!"
[Taichi]
"And when I do, you better have become at least the King of Japan, Youko-chan."
//But if Japan is Heaven... -GHS

[Youko]
"...that may be... excessively problematic."
[Youko]
"I would have to impose a monarchical system."
//Don't worry, Nipponia will likely go back to being an empire before the end of the century. -GHS

[Taichi]
"No kidding!"

I smile,
the girl remained downcast.

[Taichi]
"Sayonara, Hasekura Youko."
[Taichi]
"You who stand above---"

A reverent bow, down to the waist.

[Youko]
"...good... b-..."

I saw her crying face.
And that, in a single stroke, left me completely satisfied.
//He never ever saw that, did he. -GHS
I closed my eyes.
//HACK this was like the only transition that's faster in the console version than on PC... -GHS

[Youko]
"......"
[Youko]
"......"
[Youko]
"......"
[Youko]
"......ah!"
[Youko]
"...breast, hurts... it's a broken heart..."
[Youko]
"I didn't know..."
//HACK disconnected. This was missing from all the routes but Misato's. -GHS
HACK seriously now... -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

For a while I stood still.
A sense of accomplishment,
a sense of loss,
that mixed and entangled, in ways I couldn't manage.
And soon afterwards---

[Taichi]
"UhwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

AAAAAAAAAh!!!"
//With the a in 'wa', Ax 4x7. Or, 8:2 x7. Still a long way to go. -GHS
A shout to the sky.
No meaning to it,
just throwing out all my feelings.

[Taichi]
"It's over."

All of it.
In the world, I am alone.
In the place I belong to,
which I had made into my sanctuary.

[Nanaka]
"...good job, you."
//HACK later/evening doll, now it's evening instead of night? No idea. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's you."

It has been some time since she last turned up.

[Nanaka]
"Want me to hold you?"
//MOMz. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I do feel like it but... nah."
[Taichi]
"Because this week is Youko-chan's alone."
//HACK evening doll -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...right."

For my eyes this will likely be the last time.
//Maybe he went blind. -GHS
The function of the tapetum is being lost... maybe.
//Just magically after being used seven times! Pure settei. -GHS
The existence of the gate appears more vague than before.
If the function of my eyes normalizes, I'm sure I won't be able to observe it anymore.
Unless reset, of course.
//How the hell does he know this? Totally chuuni. -GHS
But I had no such intention.
//As the next route will show, he's still deluding himself. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"It's close, innit."

[Taichi]
"Yup, it's close."

[Nanaka]
"Cheers for your good work."

[Taichi]
"Yeah... thanks, mother."

[Nanaka]
"Nahahah!"
//Nanaka, as her name suggests, laughs with a nahahah. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Well, see you next week."

Nanaka disappeared. Overtly so.
//Like Youko always does... -GHS
And I realized.

[Taichi]
"...did I say, 'mother'?"

And then, the world was dusk---
//Not in NVL mode in any version. -GHS
