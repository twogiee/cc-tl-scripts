[Taichi]
"No other way then, I'm giving you this."

From the Taichi Bag I take out the sandwich wraps.

[Miki]
"These are...?"

[Taichi]
"The legend of how they are eaten sandwitched between sand and a witch has been retold for---"

[Miki]
"They're sandwiches are they?"

Forestalled.

[Taichi]
"Ngggh, you're right!"
//Almost, but not quite, the Kanon noise. -GHS

[Miki]
"I made you angry..."

[Taichi]
"Have'em!"

[Miki]
"Eh, seriously? But what about your lunch, Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"I can scrounge up as many as I want."
[Taichi]
"...there's enough for two, so do eat them with Kiri-chin."

[Miki]
"I'm thanking ye... but..."
//Bit jumbled -GHS

[Taichi]
"...earlier I invited Kiri-chin to lunch, but let's just say I wasn't considered a possible partner."
//Should probably be read with air quotes. -GHS

[Miki]
"Woooh, even with humanity annihilated this guy still goes and bullies Kiri-chin..."

Miki shook and trembled with fear.

[Taichi]
"I wasn't among the ones that changed with the Fall of mankind."
//Who has? -GHS

So I proclaimed in the style of a monologue.
//See CCX0001 -GHS

[Miki]
"Totally a Young Man..."

[Taichi]
"Young Adult Cadet you mean. Make no mistake you!"

[Miki]
"Don't get the difference."

[Taichi]
"Young Adults are men among men who know both the bitter and the sweet by having had all kinds of experiences in life. In other words, it is the ideal image of an adult on which my aims are set."
[Taichi]
"Loved by his subordinates and highly competent in work: a Super Elite that dwarfs even his superiors."
[Taichi]
"Amorous adventures on the beach in the weekends to forget the bustle of the big city, enjoying cognac in his study at night while silently reading the collected poems of Byron."
//Someone said Byronic Hero? Weekend Beach Amorous Adventure, although it sounds less like a nukige and more like a bad romance novel, should remind of his insistence in going to the beach on Friday, see Sendback routes. -GHS

[Miki]
"...so they're not just about girls, you have fantasies about your future self as well?"
//Well, he might be having fantasies about his present too. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That is excessively praiseful, Mickey."
//That's how Mickey Mouse is written in Japanese. Will return. Still better than that girl David Bowie once wrote a letter to. -GHS

[Miki]
"Mickey here. I am not praising you."

[Taichi]
"Well, for now I am still a cadet, ergo I am but a bud and nothing more."
[Taichi]
"Once I blossom, surely even Kiri-chin shall fall madly in love..."

[Miki]
"Ugly ducklings usually grow up to still be ugly you kno~w."

So she says smilingly.
//Intentional, the translator notes down notingly -GHS

[Taichi]
"Meanie!"

I break down crying.

[Taichi]
"But I need that hope to live!"

[Miki]
"There, there, please don't cryã€œ."

[Taichi]
"...anyway, do say that you have made those sandwiches yourself, Mickey, so you can get Kiri-chin to eat them."

[Miki]
"...uhm, if I take them I will say that for sure, but..."
[Miki]
"There's no aphrodisiac or anything in here is there?"

[Taichi]
"............"

Distrusted to a quite pleasant level.
