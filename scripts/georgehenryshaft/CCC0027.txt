I tried going to the rooftop.
Present time is past 10AM.
After all... we have no classes in this situation.
//Perfectly applicable if at least he is in Class X... perhaps everybody, given he's running around like nobody's business even in the flashbacks. -GHS
I only wanted to come into contact with the space of the school itself.
Just to taste the quiet normal unruffled daily life.
Like an ataractic---
There is no one on the rooftop...

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I mean there wasn't.
//亡かった -GHS
Club... that's what she's here for.
I look up at the antenna.
People have vanished from the world.
And we were individuals, unable to stand in unity.
//See CCB0022. -GHS
Though I believe this powerlessness would not change even if there had been unity.
//See Week 1. -GHS
...with these individual problems, this heavy situation would make any heart creak.

[Taichi]
"......"

Won't direct sunlight exposure be dangerous?
An alarm clock was casually dropped nearby.
Seems to be Senpai's private property.
//Emphasis should be duh at this point. -GHS
I set the alarm for five minutes from now.
This should wake her up,
because Mimi-senpai does not have the Sleepyhead Character Attribute.
//HACK zoom it. The console versions erroneously switch to a full antenna zoom here - even the 360 version, though it's harder to see since the top of the antenna isn't visible due to Top Grade Designers who evidently thought the main feature of the rooftop was the big flat pavement. -GHS
Running my fingers held over the netting for fall & suicide prevention, I move towards the stairs.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

In one place, that one place, the wire mesh had become fragile.
//Same where most people fall down including Yutaka, so he knows that place very well. -GHS
A light press and it gives in, conspicuously.
If I were to put my body's weight on it I would just fall down.

[Taichi]
"Dangerooous."

In Gunjou, where so many people live in their own fantasies, that's a serious management problem.

[Taichi]
"..."

Well, with our members we should be alright.
None of our members had impediments to our normal daily life.
//HACK unzoom it. Still the erroneous full antenna in the console version. And the 360 version just pauses for a second to reload the same BG. -GHS
Slowly I head towards the stairs.
I open the door.
//??????? what arcade cabinet did this come from? -GHS
From behind my back, I could hear the sound of the alarm clock,

[Misato]
"nMah?"

and Senpai making an odd voice.
//Because 21st Century Moekko, see CCC3016 -GHS
With a tiny little smile, I close the door behind my back.
//HACK black screen. There's some damn persistent doll leftover here from previous scripts, so doing it like this. -GHS
