I tried going to the rooftop.
Present time is past 10AM.
After all... we have no classes in this situation.
//Perfectly applicable if at least he is in Class X... perhaps everybody, given he's running around like nobody's business even in the flashbacks. -GHS
I only wanted to come into contact with the space of the school itself.
Just to taste the quiet normal unruffled daily life.
Like an ataractic---
There is no one on the rooftop...

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

I mean there wasn't.
//亡かった -GHS
Club... that's what she's here for.
I look up at the antenna.
People have vanished from the world.
And we were individuals, unable to stand in unity.
//See CCB0022. -GHS
Though I believe this powerlessness would not change even if there had been unity.
//See Week 1. -GHS
...with these individual problems, this heavy situation would make any heart creak.

[Taichi]
"......"

Won't direct sunlight exposure be dangerous?
An alarm clock was casually dropped nearby.
Seems to be Senpai's private property.
//Emphasis should be duh at this point. -GHS
I set the alarm for five minutes from now.
This should wake her up,
because Mimi-senpai does not have the Sleepyhead Character Attribute.
//See CCC4019, CCD1001. She doesn't have it as Character Attribute, but that doesn't mean she doesn't oversleep. -GHS
Running my fingers held over the netting for fall & suicide prevention, I move towards the stairs.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

In one place, that one place, the wire mesh had become fragile.
//Same where most people fall down including Yutaka, so he knows that place very well. -GHS
A light press and it gives in, conspicuously.
If I were to put my body's weight on it I would just fall down.

[Taichi]
"Dangerooous."

In Gunjou, where so many people live in their own fantasies, that's a serious management problem.

[Taichi]
"..."

Well, with our members we should be alright.
None of our members had impediments to our normal daily life.
//Taichi x1.5, Kiri x0.5, Misato x2 (half are the attempts/near-deaths). Plus Yutaka. Troll meter is approaching the red line. -GHS
Slowly I head towards the stairs.
I open the door.
//??????? what arcade cabinet did this come from? -GHS
From behind my back, I could hear the sound of the alarm clock,

[Misato]
"nMah?"

and Senpai making an odd voice.
//Because 21st Century Moekko, see CCC3016 -GHS
With a tiny little smile, I close the door behind my back.
