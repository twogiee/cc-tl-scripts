[Taichi]
"......"

And then, the present.
As Kiri had said, the world became clean and tidy so easily.
//See CCC3007 -GHS
And I realized as well that humans could just simply Pass Away.
I wouldn't say it should be like Adam and Eve, but it'd have been good if at least humans just a little bit more perfect had survived.
//We're about 5 chapters too late for them. -GHS
Those two, originally, had been provided with completeness, with the integrity to live eternally, but because they ate the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil and were therefore punished, they were made into something incomplete.
//The thing that Taichi's avoiding to say, however, is that Biblically they became incomplete not by being separated from each other, which they always were, but by being separated from God. That's the error Taichi is committing: thinking that becoming Alter Egos is what's gonna regain Eden. In practical sense, thinking that what truly 'broke' him was him getting rejected by Youko at the moment of the Fall of the Eden of his own backstory. See CCX0001, where he admits he's wrong: he went "mad" when he was born: his sin is the Original Sin. -GHS
And yet, they are recorded to have lived a thousand years.
//...how do people read this stuff and not notice, even if just out of cynicism...? -GHS
If one continues with the reading of the Scriptures, it is possible to see how the lifespan of each successive generation decreases.
//No one even thought that him knowing this was just sort of odd, given the context? Now see CCC3027. This was also removed in the PS2 version. Nice. -GHS
And then, this generation.
//This sinful generation that shan't get any sign but that of Jonas, who lived in the whale. Which then inspired Pinocchio which then brings us to dolls becoming alive and Cross Channel. Strange journey. -GHS
We were losing even the soundness of mind.
What could God possibly be thinking of doing by spreading around these humans so chock full of wounds?
//This question may be the drive behind Jintai. -GHS
Like me... so engorged in wicked feelings as I am.
//See CCZAS: it's not his sight that brought these people in, it's God. -GHS
I thought that the world was revolving anyhow,
and that it was possible to take back what was done.
//Given 取り返しがつかない is the far more common term, and has the meaning of absolute irredeemability, its positive opposite is what is meant here. Seems particularly appropriate considering that, no, it can't be done. -GHS
Extreme argument #1.
//There doesn't seem to be any more. -GHS
All will be reset, even a massacre.
//No, dumbass, 皆殺し is chapter sev-- ohhh, clever boy Ryukishi. Clever clever. -GHS
With the disappearance of memories as lagniappe.
A world in which advancement has no
consequence is a world that only has the
the amusement of the potential.
That was a pleasure I had well envisioned.
Desire, like a snake, raises its head.
//See CCA0021. Just remembering the definition should prove the certainty of failure Taichi is going towards. Snake because p3n1s!!1. Or see CCC0000, since Youko is Teh Devils. -GHS
It proclaims the beginning of the game.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, that's the spot where Shinkawa Yutaka died you know."

Kiri was not surprised.
She turns around, taking her time.

[Taichi]
"?"

I was a little surprised at Kiri being unsurprised.
//He expected lack of reaction. Instead... -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so the world came to be like this... where even people are gone..."
[Kiri]
"In exchange for malice being gone... its density is also gone..."
[Kiri]
"And yet there you are, unchanged."
//This is where her being frayed comes into play. All her words apply back at her, the hypocrite. This is not much different from Taichi trying replicate his rape at the hands of Youko, and equally far from having mean intent, even if the results are simply not the ones desired. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

I was completely taken aback.
The way she spoke seemed belligerent.
//See CCC3002. 好敵手 vs 好戦的 seems interesting. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I have meant to ask this for some time."
[Kiri]
"Senpai, how come you are alive?"

It was a wedge being driven through my physical heart.
//No, moron, the undead is Sakuraba, and he's not a vampire! Though the concept of Emotional Vampirism certainly is part of Kiri's problem with Taichi... -GHS
『Say, I got one question though... why don't you just die right this very instant?』
Overlap.
Past and present,
crossing.
Exactly as if the blade cast off long ago had now suddenly been thrown back at me.
//Or as if Kiri, who has delayed emotional reaction, is now reacting to that scene we've just seen. Also see CCC4006. -GHS
What an ironical composition.
//He's flustered and he's about to start acting like an ass to escape from what is happening. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Do you think you have the qualifications to live inside of yourself?"
//See CCC0045A -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

[Kiri]
"You are... wicked."
//DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE that's so wicked! You know what this things needs? GUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNS!!! -GHS

How the word uses that kanji from my last name. I found that to be an accurate metaphor.
//;_; -GHS

[Kiri]
"You're no person. You have nothing more than the semblance of a person. You camouflage yourself as a person. As insects do."
//Don't let the pressure of the scene dodge another odd detail: this is the first, and pretty much the last time that one of the tsunderes calls the protagonist an insect. Is this scene even intended to be taken seriously at all? -GHS
[Kiri]
"Camouflaged, you take the shape of a person, and attack people."
//Like he's doing now to this annoying brittle 15 year old girl who's walking up to him all alone, in a world with no one else, and who could snap her like a twig with just the fingers. Her behavior is possibly even crazier than his. -GHS
[Kiri]
"You are something that hurts people. Completely incompatible."
//Now she's calling him human antimatter. This is a comedy scene. -GHS
[Kiri]
"The reason why your Conformity Coefficient crosses over 80 has been inexplicable to me for a long time. But that is absolutely nothing strange. Because the part inside you that is human is literally less than twenty percent and no more."
//Now here's a nice oddity. 80 is written in Western numerals, 20 isn't; this puts an emphasis on the 8 rather than the 20. Since the real number of his humanity isn't 20 but 16, we have 8 and 1+6=7. This is very intentional. -GHS

Talking with garrulity,
she goes to construct vivid images, overturning the pattern thus far preserved within the name Sakura Kiri.
//With words, not her figure. IOW, she's become like he is in his moments of ass-talking exposition to avoid talking about his real feelings, see CCX0001. This is not her becoming Supersecure, this is her falling apart. -GHS
The knife that were those words were trying to stab at my very essence.
//See CCC0014, CCC3004. Well, the knives are metaphorical, surely no other weapon is. -GHS
The dull knife that was all she possessed so far---
//Atmosphere break! -GHS
>                                              trump card
Became Sakura Kiri's kiri-fuda!
//Wordplay so transparent and awful can't have a reaction expected from the reader except cringing. More than with all the crap above, readers here are presumed to read this as Taichi ridiculing Kiri and not taking anything she's saying seriously, where context and character analysis demonstrates that the real reason is a typical, incompetent attempt to break a tense mood he can't manage. All mixed with how Kiri's attack is hypocritical and nonsensical. Expected audience reaction remains the same: a cringing WTF. Furries elicit the same reaction, therefore, there it goes. -GHS

[Kiri]
"You are a monster."
[Kiri]
"Your deceit is that you do not pour your heart and soul into the monster you are, despite your place in society being that of a monster."
//She's all but telling him that he should be more of a Rapist Protagonist! -GHS
[Kiri]
"Did you think that empathy could sprout between person and monster, and that you could have a happy life in harmony with others? That you would be able to lay hands on the happiness of the ordinary person?"
[Kiri]
"It will not be."
[Kiri]
"In this world there is just a little kindness and no more, but there is absolutely no part set aside for you. No, it is simply out of the question that any ever would be set aside."
//See CCC0031B, CCC3007. -GHS
[Kiri]
"It is the same as no one would hug with love the parasite that comes out of their body, having devoured its way through it. Should one like that ever even exist, they would be madmen."
//We're still talking about the Christian God, who would do that. Indeed the idea that the guy upstairs would be a madman to accept even murderers as long as they bend their knee is a very typical question. -GHS
[Kiri]
"You are always searching for game to become a sacrifice for your own benefit. This is clear to me. Up until now, that was something you could suppress. But then the world became like this, the number of persons became insufficient, so your suppression is ineffective."
//See CCA0002. Yes, everybody. !!!THE TWIST IS THAT TAICHI IS A JOURNALIST!!! DUN DUN DUNNNNNN!!! -GHS
[Kiri]
"Because the need for camouflage has vanished."
//And STILL she's talking to the monster to his face. Kiri believes this in the same way that Tomoki really disliked Taichi like he said in CCB0022. She's doing nothing but continuing her previous pattern of preaching justice. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Your eyes are always focused on us, so that you can enjoy the hurting. And it's not something done instantly, you slowly take the time to perform that bullish sexual 'teasing' of yours all the way to the end."
//(3P) just doesn't fit in this tone, however, it's still extremely odd that the big great Wounding And Hurting thing she'd bring up would be teasing, written with an oddly sexualized kanji. This continues to underline that the scene is not intended to be taken fully seriously. Neither Taichi's apparent contempt nor Kiri's apparent venom are the true character intent. And then it brings back to the question of Yusa: was it the same there? -GHS
[Kiri]
"Not a person, nor a monster."
//Now she's just flat-out contradicting herself! -GHS
[Kiri]
"Then who or what are you? You are neither who nor what, that is what you are, just something that ought to have disappeared from the world. That is what I think."
//And three days of him not being an annoying prick to her later... "I wanna be your sex slave! Go on, all the teasing you like!" Not poor writing, but a reading key. -GHS
[Kiri]
"The majority of mankind was so full of malice, but even that had a value far greater than your one life. To me, that is the truth."
//This is completely laughable! It's so caricatured that at this point the reading key becomes transparent: tsundere. She's simply being tsun to him, nothing more. She means these words like any good tsundere does: not in the absolute slightest. -GHS
[Kiri]
"I will give two pieces of advice."
//She hates him so much he's giving him advice. -GHS
[Kiri]
"The first, if you believe that within the exchange of touches with other people you will become a real human, you are mistaken. That will not be. Thinking that is to blaspheme humanity. Because I have never seen a more perfect monster than you, Senpai."
[Kiri]
"You are, without exaggeration, a psychotic, a deviant of the soul. A madman among madmen."
//It's just increasingly ridiculous and mad. This is all on the basis of an ex-post facto rationalization of Taichi kissing her (due to his automatic repetition of a previous pattern) after having witnessed him together with Taichi on the rooftop the day Yutaka jumped. In no way is this to be taken seriously. -GHS
[Kiri]
"...the crowning jewel of all that go mad."
//This even sounds stupid, if you think about it. -GHS
[Kiri]
"And then one more. Do not even think of wanting to lay your hands on us in any sense."
[Kiri]
"Should you approach us in search for a sacrificial lamb, Senpai..."

Kiri unleashes the very final thrust.

[Kiri]
"I will shoot to kill."
//See CCC3007 again. That last bit of irony for the cherry on the top. And another script of pure troll winds to a close. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

[Kiri]
"...I will never, ever hand Miki over to you."
//See CCA0015. SOMEONE is taking someone else too seriously... except of course, Miki is Kiri's half here. Taichi's error seems to have been not to recognize this, somehow. Perhaps because he can see Miki does *not* take Kiri seriously. Also interesting in how these words Taichi could've said to Yutaka with regards to Kiri. -GHS
[Kiri]
"I won't let you break her!"

With the sound of determined footstep, she passes right underarm.
The door creaks.
The door shuts.
I became alone.

[Taichi]
"......monster..."

Monster.
Monster.
Monster.
I ruminate over the word, and try biting into it.
Bitter.
That is the taste of the brain.
The brain secretes a certain type of
neurotransmitter, and its flavor rides directly
to the nerves that govern the taste, creating
the illusion.
//He's even going into synesthesia! -GHS
Monster.
So exquisite that it's the exact same word
I use to represent myself.
//Now see CCD0022A. Odd he'd contradict himself there, if he really agrees he's a monster. But as the end of the script truly shows, he doesn't believe he's a monster. He wishes he were, because that'd make things sooo simple. -GHS

[Taichi]
"OwChCh."

Well look here, it hurts.
My dried up heart stings.
The countless slices that had been cut into it continue to produce agony.

[Taichi]
"Dammit... all blunt like that..."

I fall to my knees.
I became dizzy from vertigo.

[Taichi]
"Awww ouch... ouch ouch. But it hurts..."

But none of them are fatal wounds.
Kiri's knife did not successfully penetrate into my heart.
//Pure bullshit. One doesn't pass out for hours on the spot after simply being called a monster without it hurting like damn hell. If the crossbow is as fictional as the knife, and the knife is just catsp~~ harsh words, then this is close to what happens to Taichi when he gets "shit" by her. -GHS
It just left thin gashes on the surface.
There's pain but,
it is of the genus of mere child's play.
The... Attack that I took in my beginnings was nothing like this.
//And here's the real problem: he has a very skewed perspective on the topic. An attack that completely shatters the rationality, takes away color from the hair and more being the standard would make the above look small. But the body has evidence... -GHS
But there's this feeling that I haven't taken an attack in a long time.
A moderate attack that invokes a moderate strain.
Is that sort of like drunkenness?
I end up laying down on that spot.
//See CCC3004. This is the same thing that Yutaka does. Taichi has narcolepsy attacks when overstimulated just like him! -GHS

[Taichi]
"...if you can shoot me to death... then please do so..."
[Taichi]
"Please release me from my pleee〜asure!♪"
//Seems to be a play on いっそひと思いに殺しておくれ -GHS

This mood wasn't bad at all.
