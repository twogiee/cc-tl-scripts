IF $KAISOU == 1 JMP SCENE001
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
I am awake.
Sunlight was piercing through the window.
Seems I have been hard asleep. I did not have any dreams.
The time is... 7AM.
Going to school is necessity.
Miki was here.

[Taichi]
"Waiting again?"

[Miki]
"...ah, Senpai."
//Not Senpai-gata, Senpai-tachi, Senpai and Hasekura-senpai as well. -GHS
[Miki]
"She's not coming, maybe something happened..."

[Taichi]
"I come bringing word from Kiri."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"She intends to go investigate around the power plant, in a duo with Youko-chan. Woman among Women inn'she!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"With... Hasekura-senpai?"

[Taichi]
"Yup. And that very Hasekura-senpai has also come as today's guest!"
//A guest that Miki totally unsuspiciously refused to acknowledge despite how she was standing right next to him. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"
//HACK they're not even gonna try, are they *siiiigh* -GHS

[Miki]
"...it has been a long while since we last met."
//This is the first time the two interact on screen - and Miki doesn't even use her name! It's said that Miki interacts with her at the hokora, but in fact, this might be the first time the two meet in real-time. Of course, this might mean that Miki remembers that stuff about the hokora and everything. It's also the first and last sentence that Miki targets directly at Youko. And it's not "hello", and doesn't use her name, or actually is technically targeted at her. Also see CCC0041 (Misato and Youko) and CCA0008 (Miki's signature). -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Well, talk."

I poke her back.
//HACK -GHS

[Youko]
"I will be investigating the power plant with Sakura Kiri. I will not let anyone intrude."

So she said as if proclaiming it to an enemy.

[Miki]
"I-, I see..."

It had peremptory force.
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"So where is Kiri-chin now?"
//Notice how Taichi answers, not Youko. She's talking to him now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"She's already on board the airplane."
//Chase her to the plane, Mikiii! Don't give up your dreeeam! Yeah, totally worthy of a romance novel from a certain French publishing house. -GHS

[Miki]
"EH?!"

[Taichi]
"And because of that you can't see her. Right, Youko-kun?"
//HACK -GHS

[Youko]
"...right."

[Miki]
"So that's how it is..."
//Youko didn't say anything more than Taichi did. Not necessarily a reaction to her. -GHS

Wilt.

[Taichi]
"Well then, good luck with your investigation."

[Youko]
"...got that."

A larghetto bow,
//Sendai-ben. http://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8F%E3%81%9F going with a vaguely incorrect musical term as I don't think this is the place for weird mangling of words. Oddly enough. -GHS
and with this her role ends.
............
And, after making Youko-chan leave,
//Also completely non-suspicious. -GHS

[Miki]
"If Hasekura-senpai said it, then there's no mistaking it..."
//She says this as if she had only heard this is so from Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'ndeed."

[Miki]
"But she's still around, I'm so glad."
//She probably knows she isn't at this point. -GHS

A great big relief at nothing.

[Taichi]
"Well, why don't we eat something sweet in someplace cool?"

[Miki]
"...sweets?"

Her eyes opened very wide.

[Taichi]
"Hard candy and gummy candy. Handmade."
//HACK earlier -GHS

Her eyes opened very wide.
//Yes, it's used twice in a row, and only this has a doll change. No idea. -GHS

[Miki]
"Made by hand?"

/Taichi: "Mh-hm. They're Youko-chan's though."
///Obviously an older revision. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mh-hm. By Youko-chan though."
[Taichi]
"Sugar in moderation may be good for maintaining an attractive body shape. Gummies are Konjac, 'course. 0 calories."
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"Zero calories?!"
//Women. -GHS

It was settled.
//HACK to black -GHS
............
//HACK doll right away -GHS

[Miki]
"It's like your mommy used to make..."
[Miki]
"My cheeks... my schmiling cheeks..."

[Taichi]
"Indeed, indeed."

Miki got in good humor by eating handmade candy.

[Miki]
"Hasekura-senpai is a woman of many mysteries, she is."

[Taichi]
"Ain't she."
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"Are you two lovers or something?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, we've just lived together, nothing more."

[Miki]
"Sharing the house!"

[Taichi]
"Sharing the house is wrong."
//And this is likely how you know these are older revisions. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because we don't have parents, the two of us were being graciously hosted by that family."
[Taichi]
"We're sort of brother and sister."

[Miki]
"So that is how it was."

[Taichi]
"So, I'll give you some Thousand-Year Candy too. Let's both suck it and make some pointy icicle shapes!"
//This might possibly be a game played with Chitoseame, but it's hard to tell under the obvious sexual overtones that are evident from this sentence being written in Japanese. -GHS

[Miki]
"Weeee, Thousand-Year Candy!"

She flashes a smile.
This one day I spent with Miki was fun.
It's been nothing but an accumulation of silly innocent scenes, but,
I know that there is a value there, a value far greater than the weight of the impression they leave.
The time we have left here is so little.

[Taichi]
"...and this, too, might be said to be deception."

But if I can return her to the other side, where Kiri also is,
will that be enough for Miki to forgive me?
Which Miki would---
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS
Wednesday.
To school.
A gate to prevent desertion.
It seems to exist less to protect students, and more to protect the outside world from us.
That is the impression it left.

[Taichi]
"'morning."

[Miki]
"Howsit."

[Taichi]
"If you're looking for Kiri---"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, no, today it's different."
[Miki]
"I'm waiting for you, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh, and is there something I can be looking forwards to in that?"

[Miki]
"My Love Feelings are at 0 but I really like you."
//Liar liar... or not, since 0 is also the loop. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

So far away.

[Miki]
"Hmmm...?"
[Miki]
"Senpai, why do you have this sour stench?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, this is my perfume. Fragrance of perspiration, Sweat Mint."
//Who knows how long he's been going without a bath, possibly even multiple weeks. Still mint around. -GHS

[Miki]
"Lieeeeeees! No way there's a perfume like thaaaaaaat!"
//7+7 (counting the initial vowel) -GHS
[Miki]
"Eh... do you bathe?"

[Taichi]
"Baise?"
[Taichi]
"I'm a gentlemen, therefore baise-moi on my frow line!"
//Furo-irain, see CCA0013, this is PCP Yusa. Baise-moi is of course 'fuck me', but since 'baiser' is also kiss, seems plausible Mistah Doesntknowforeignlanguages would totally conflate them. And I also get the vain satisfaction of making another awful pun even worse, again, and in less than ten minutes of work, again. -GHS

[Miki]
"...I mean bathe with water..."

[Taichi]
"I ain't worth water, miss."
//QUOD PER SOOOORTEM STERNIT FOOORTEM MECUM OMNES PLANGITEEEEEE -GHS

[Miki]
"Bleagh... then... today, you...?"

[Taichi]
"Wednesday therefooore, third day I guess?"
//So he took a bath on Sunday before leaving for the hokora? Except baths are usually taken in the evening. Since this needs to be necessarily at least after the Kiri route, which is at least after two full weeks of 'normal' living... even ignoring the continuity error where Taichi somehow stops being bloodied after looping the very first time, this could be no less than the 24th straight day without a bath. I'm going with another continuity error here. -GHS

So I proclaim with the tone of voice a simpleton.
//Simpleton = overliteral translation. -GHS

[Miki]
"Pfwaaah."
//Nothing to do with CCA0027, oddly enough. -GHS

She swooned.

[Taichi]
"You OK!"

I stripped off my jacket and bent over Miki.
//That, or his shirt... -GHS

[Miki]
"WaWaWaWaWah?!"

Earnest resistance.
............

[Miki]
"...I can't even carelessly swoon now..."
//Assuming that's the point. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry, spinal cord reflex."

[Miki]
"...that spinal cord is dangerous."

[Taichi]
"Well, don'tcha worry. Me not taking a bath is not something that I'll die over."

[Miki]
"I hate sweat-smelling Senpai."
//It's prurar. Plulal. Prular. Praline. Mmmh, praline. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...not even if you say that."
//I am having unreasonable levels of fun here. -GHS

[Miki]
"Come here, please."

I am taken along.
Miki brought out a hose from the rooftop prefab,

[Miki]
"Senpai, remove your clothes."
[Miki]
"'course, below too."

[Taichi]
"No problem."

I strip.

[Miki]
"Wh-, what kind of underwear..."
//From Kiri. -GHS

Miki went full red.

[Taichi]
"This development I had anticipated!"
[Taichi]
"Therefore, I have tried to stay faithful to the source material."

Still-standing on the rooftop was I, underwear endlessly elephantine.
//Standing still, not still standing. -GHS
Then the valve attached on the hose's grip was opened.

[Miki]
"And now...!

An onslaught of strong water pressure on me.

[Taichi]
"uPfth!"

[Miki]
"Soh'raSoh'ra!"

Suffocating Citrus Mint.
She lets rip with the body soap,
and an entire bottle of it at that.
...do I stink that much?

[Miki]
"Senpai, scrub with a good rasping-rasp!"
//Same as shipdeck scrub. After porn, SFX are what's the most important in Coarse Charnel(sp). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes..."

[Miki]
"I will be spraying the water, therefore please give cleaning your undivided attention, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Like the unspeaking wash-free Musenmai Rice I want to become..."
//ATM machines are so useful. -GHS Shaft

[Miki]
"J'aguaaah!"
//Jaguar. -GHS

Pretty novel to use an onomatopoeia reminiscent of a feline mammal for the sound of splashing water.
Miki is definitely a rookie from which I have high expectations.

[Taichi]
"When you're pair-ing with Kiri in the pool you were all damn Icharabu, but when you're with me I get the Pigpen treatement, grrr!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"..."
//HACK this scene had a ton of new lines! The older one is sorta gone, sorta reintegrated. This is a pretty good one, too! -GHS

Ahhh, water stream feels so good.
It gives me a cleaning feeling.
It's as if it was washing off all the way through to the disordered part of this myself so avoidant of conflict with logical standards.
//Guh, why so overcomplicated dammit... -GHS

[Miki]
"You becoming clean in theeere?"

[Taichi]
"My cleanliness is going favorably!"
[Taichi]
"...but a certain part precious to this Kurosu Taichi here is also getting pleeenty cleaned too (sob)."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"But that's a veeery good thing isn't it!"

[Taichi]
"I-, is it now... but it sorta feels like my heart is entirely gone..."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"I-, if you were to become... someone Pure, Senpai..."
//Same terms as Matthew 5:8. -GHS

Miki's eyes are scary.

[Miki]
"That'd be something I'd have no problems wiiith!"

The gal's putting a wish into this?!
This is bad!
Just as in those sorta-like-that anime and manga where a believing heart becomes a physical force, couldn't this Purity of Miki be turned by this world into a rasp that would shave off those parts of mine that are so proper of me?
//Remember Miki has stolen plenty from God and at least one of his followers, but now she's... a little better, at least. -GHS

[Taichi]
"STOOOP, STOP THIIIS!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Be scythed dooown!"
//See CCA0004, same reference. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't put a wish into thiiis!"

[Miki]
"Woooh!"

[Taichi]
"Ghyeee!"
//HACK sky -GHS

MY RUDE SEEEEEEEELF!!!
//It's literally 'my ore', see below. -GHS
Five minutes later---
//HACK BG & doll -GHS

[Miki]
"...he grew obedient."
//As used against Kiri. -GHS
[Miki]
"Ho-, how is it? Are you all cleany-clean?"

I raise my head, harmless young boy as I am,
and give a smile to my Kouhai, Miki-chan.

[Taichi]
"Yes, thank you very much."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"U'wah?!"

[Taichi]
"This young boy became all immaculate. Thank you, Miki-chan. This young boy is happy!"

[Miki]
"He uses Boku?!"
//TL Note: this should explain that when he uses 'young boy' he means Boku, but there's a commented script that explains that, so it's sorta pointless, except no one'll read it because it's hard, so it has a point, but no one can even remember what happened five seconds before so oh I hate you all and don't care anymore (sob). -GHS

What a clean and serene feeling I have.
Now, this young boy has become a honest man.
I wouldn't wound anyone now, definitely.
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Uhm... I have questions."
//See CCA0010. He does this stuff surprisingly often. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What are they?"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"One close parenthesis. Flipping skirts is...?"
//See CCZXDC, she's just the type to say that literally. And yes, you do type "maru ichi" in the Japanese IME to get that symbol. -GHS

This young boy's eyebrows knit.
//If this is annoying, then good, that's the intent. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Doing such things is no good!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"...oooh..."
//HACK doll -GHS
[Miki]
"Two close parenthesis. Touching boobs or butt is...?"
//This one required copypasta, dammit IME. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's the worst for a man. It's a crime! As long as there is the spark of life in my eyes, I won't let anyone do such things!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"That's sort of American-ish, but, well, let's set that aside..."
//HACK doll -GHS
[Miki]
"Three close parenthesis. What about war?"

This young boy sorrowfully turned down his face.

[Taichi]
"...the fate of Man. But someday Man will overcome it, I believe so!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Magnificent..."
[Miki]
"Dependable... this guy here now is so dependable..."

[Taichi]
"Thank you. I'll do my best not to betray Miki-chan's expectations."
//Third person because lame translation lololol -GHS
[Taichi]
"Come, Miki-chan. Spray a little more water on this young boy. I want to become more clean in flesh and in heart. I want to become more Just!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Ra-, Rajarre!!!"
//Obviously misspelled... in fact, it googles to Chateu Lajarre wine, so punning that. -GHS

The water stream comes,
the heart of this young boy becomes snow white,
//See hair. Whoops. -GHS
and the body, itself, as well.

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

Right, I was still wearing my underwear.

[Taichi]
"Well... while I'm at it I'll make this part here all clean then."
//See CCD2002 -GHS

I was full of this feeling that made me want to make that intimate part immaculate.
I unfasten the elephant cover.
//And the idiot unleashes the monster thinking he can get better. -GHS
As it had taken the shape of a cover, it was as if taking off snug rubber gloves, it took a bit of exertion.

[Taichi]
"Theee-ere."
//This was in the original. -GHS

[Miki]
"Desiiist! Is that something you can do in front of a virgin!!!"

[Taichi]
"G'wah?!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"He was still perverteeed!!!"

The strongest hydropower available smacked me in the face, the wish for me to stay perverted put into it.
//See CCZAS. Miki, you moron! -GHS

[Taichi]
"...owChChChChCh..."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah! Sorry... you OK?"

[Taichi]
"Whey, Miki... ain'tcha got a waaay short skirt today now."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Hawah?"

[Taichi]
"Waaay 'rresistible, ain't they, dem miniskirts of dem High School Girls. Gwahahah!"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"HE RETURNED TO NORMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAAL!!!"
//HACK out with the doll, footsteps & door SFX -GHS

Miki ran away.

[Taichi]
"Come on, come on?"
[Taichi]
"...the hell's this."
[Taichi]
"Whoa, I got naked?"
//See CCC3018. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Really, the hell's this even..."

Lying down on my back, I could see the sky---
//This sounds entirely stupid until realizing that this is C.S. Lewis' approach to organized religion writ silly together with Tanaka's specific backstory woes. It's entirely consistent with the rest of the story at every level. BTW: total non-copypasta and non-partial copypasta lines are a round 70. BTW2 (the vengeance): consider this in the context of what happened with Yusa. -GHS
Old version here: -GHS
/The hosedown struck the elephant's nose.
/Erection.
/Miki: "Whyyy do you become like that with just thiiis!!!"
/She was sobbing.
/Taichi: "Come ask my oversensitive bodeh..."
///"bodeh"??? -GHS
/Miki: "Well I don't caaare!"
/Taichi: "But I told you, the lower part of my body is a different animal!"
///See CCC4003 -GHS
/Taichi: "Well... while I'm at it I'll make this part here all clean I guess."
/While giving light strokes over the Elephant Cover, I try to undo its button.
/Miki: "Desiiist! Is that something you can do in front of a virgin!!!"
/Taichi: "G'wah?!"
/The strongest hydropower available smacked me in the face.
/And as I tumbled over, I could see the sky---
//Thursday September 10, 1998 -GHS
Miki isn't coming.
And I remembered,
what happened on that day when I first met Miki.
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
The first to call out to Miki throughout the whole of Gunjou, I think, was I.
Having been thrown out from her original school, she was a lovely lamb that had been brought into the blue folds of Gunjou.
The first day,
she did not have anything to eat at lunch... it seemed.
Through an Information Get from Miyuki, who had become her classmate, I immediately set out to search for her,
to set up a Meeting Event dressed up as coincidence.
In front of the main gate, shut to avoid causing trouble for the neighborhood,
there Miki was standing, as if stuck.
It could be said to be the pattern of any new admittee.

[Taichi]
"Hii-y!"
//Wait, THIS has dolls??? -GHS

[Miki]
"...eh?'

And then, all sorts of things happened.

[Miki]
"Pft."

A tiny laugh.

[Miki]
"...weirdo."

She opened up a little.

[Taichi]
"If it has to be like this, I shall eat here by force!"

[Kiri]
"Wh-, what do you think you are doing?!"

I ended up quarreling with Kiri and her identical aims.
//HACK fade -GHS

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah... what indeeed!"

While fighting with words, Miki showed a face of complicated emotions.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
HACK different transition back -GHS
However much I waited, Miki did not come.
//She sealed herself home in the losing path, so it's likely this is her deciding if to show up anymore. Wait, uhm, no, I mean, you can't wait to make her come and stuff, you have to, uhm what do you mean we're out of t-GHS

[Taichi]
"...no solving this."

I felt depressed,
and wanted to expose myself to some wind.
This rooftop devoid of Senpai was largely a place of silence and solitude.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

I lay down, arms and leg spread in the shape of the 'big' kanji.
//Sorta important since Big is Taichi's first name except without a dick. This would be different with kanji display... -GHS
The wind passes above me, glancing.
I wish it would kidnap me and take me with it as if I were a feather, but the human body is heavy, and my wish cannot be granted.
Liberation is not something that simply happens to come by.
For humans are beings capable of recognizing the weight of their own self.
//HACK out music -GHS

[Taichi]
"I must search for Miki, I just must..."

Closing my eyes, my awareness blurs.
//He falls asleep often, doesn't he. -GHS
Feeling a sense of physical discomfort, I open my eyes.
//HACK earlier music. I still don't get it in this scene. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......Miki?"

[Miki]
"Yes."

With a smile.

[Miki]
"This is Miki."

The corners of her eyes are red.
Did something happen?

[Miki]
"Ah, please keep sleeping."

[Taichi]
"...on a lap pillow, you sure?"

[Miki]
"Provided you don't do any pervy things, if you please."

[Taichi]
"And if I do?"

[Miki]
"Depends on the degree of sexual harassment."
[Miki]
"...we'd be through permanently."
//This doesn't really follow from the 'pasta. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Woooh, scary. I can't do anything then."

[Miki]
"Seriously?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, that's pretty scary, if that happened I'd get the 100 Mega Shock!"
//Neo-Geo reference. Somehow. PS2 was just altered to 100 "tera" shock, which makes even less sense. -GHS

[Miki]
"...theeen, just sleep."
[Miki]
"Finding you knocked unconscious really surprised me."

[Taichi]
"I was sleeping."

[Miki]
"Again with that ridiculous everyday life..."
[Miki]
"But when you're like that, Senpai, you're at the best."

[Taichi]
"...am I?"

[Miki]
"When you're hilarious and funny, when you're like the revelry of a festival every day."

Tears.
A cry just above me, that I cannot respond to in any way.

[Taichi]
"Miki..."

[Miki]
"But, the more I play with you Senpai... the less it's satisfying... and Kiri-chin's no more... and all the others too... my parents, and my classmates too..."
//This is so close to making it explicit! Indeed Playing Taichi's 98 Game means she plays it with whoever Taichi picks. He says there's no one, not even Kiri; therefore there must be no one for her. Even if she stops with trying to take the lead from him. -GHS
[Miki]
"...sob... my normal days have up and vanished..."

[Taichi]
"...so playing with me's no good. Well, now, there's nothing I can do, but still..."

[Miki]
"That's... not what I meant to say..."
[Miki]
"I have no self-confidence..."

[Taichi]
"What'ty?"
//ICK. -GHS

[Miki]
"The self-confidence... to live."

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha say stupid stuff. Just recklessly believe in yourself!"
//Looney bins are full of dem self-confident people. -GHS

[Miki]
"...sob... 's impossible..."
[Miki]
"Kiri-chin's not here anymore, is she?"

[Taichi]
"......why do you think that?"

[Miki]
"No real reason..."
[Miki]
"But, if there's no more people anymore... then I gotta think like that."
[Miki]
"Everyone has vanished,"
[Miki]
"and so Kiri has vanished too."
[Miki]
"And someday, will we vanish too?"
//But death is nothing to be feared if there's life on the other side. -GHS
[Miki]
"Will we just... pass away?"

[Taichi]
"...we just might."

[MIki]
"...c'mon... ahahahah... even you say that... Senpai..."

[Taichi]
"Look here, Miki. Whoever you are, the conclusion is death."
[Taichi]
"But are you going to abandon living now just because someday it will all end, Miss You Over There?"
//Omae-sama, really? -GHS

[Miki]
"...well..."

[Taichi]
"Vanishing's no biggie ya know. How about living 'till you vanish?"
//Death has moved into vanishing, the subtle bastard. In the Christian worldview, there's no death; just a disappearance from the physical world, rapture or not. -GHS
[Taichi]
"There's still lots of fun things to do."

[Miki]
"...such as?"

[Taichi]
"Wellllesse now..."
[Taichi]
"...wanna come live with me?"

[Miki]
"With you, Senpai?"
[Miki]
"Is this a confession of love?"

[Taichi]
"I will buy you anything you want!"
//Hum, see CCD2002. Same thing Touko told him during his attempt at Formatting. -GHS

Miki's eyes just peer through me and my high-end gags.
//See CCC0011C... and CCD2002. -GHS

[Miki]
"You are thinking of doing something naughty, right?"

[Taichi]
"I will."
//This route's about marriage, BTW. -GHS

[Miki]
"...ngh..."

[Taichi]
"I will, yes, I will do something naughty. This is the resolute attitude expected in one who holds belief in that being the meaning of their existence."
[Taichi]
"The instant you step over the threshold of my home, you shall become one with the Nonvirgins."
//...why does EDICT know 非処女? -GHS

[Miki]
"That quick..."

She's wincing.

[Taichi]
"The reason being that you will be like a cat put inside the box, so that your virginity and your nonvirginity will be equally probable."
//... -GHS

Abrupt drowsiness.
//Mental short circuit? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Zzz..."

[Miki]
"I shall think about it."
[Miki]
"Wha-! Asleep... so quick."
[Miki]
"......seriously."
[Miki]
"A weirdo, truly."
[Miki]
"Hahah, ahahahah..."
[Miki]
"Ahahahah, snif, ahahahah... hahah..."

............
When I woke up, Miki was smiling.

[Taichi]
"I fell asleep again...?"

[Miki]
"Yes, like you were dead to the world."
//What a log. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry, you must be numb by now. I'll get up."

[Miki]
"But before that,"

I am pinned down.

[Miki]
"I shall be making my expression of gratitude."

[Taichi]
"Gratitude?"

[Miki]
"Gratitude for the encouragement you have given me."

[Taichi]
"Well then, use your perfectly level bodeh and..."

[Miki]
"No, I think I will be expressing my gratitude via earpick."

[Taichi]
"?!"
[Taichi]
"Wanna up!"

[Miki]
"No way!"

[Taichi]
"This is bad!"

[Miki]
"Meeeow!"

A rod is thrust into the ear.
Stab.
//HACK early shake, SFX -GHS

[Taichi]
"!!!!"

And what followed was naught but Hell.
//HACK to black first -GHS
In the end, Miki did not come to my house.
//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Friday, then."

There remain three days to the swingback of the world.
Let's do what's expected of us today, as well.

[Taichi]
"...dammit, we just gotta go to the beach."

Yesterday I forgot arrangements, so I should manage somehow.

[Taichi]
"Let's go to the beach."
//HACK fade -GHS

[Miki]
"...eEH?"

We scraped up all we necessities from the Atomic General Store,
we procured a car,
and we headed to the beach.

[Taichi]
"Great, nice beach style we got!"

Triumphant pose.

[Taichi]
"And now!"
//HACK fade -GHS

[Miki]
"Too fast... progress's too fast..."

[Taichi]
"And we'll fly into things evermore."

[Miki]
"Yeees, we're sooo in spirits!"

[Taichi]
"Well, let's play!"
[Taichi]
"Woooh!"

[Miki]
"S'yaaah!"

[Taichi]
"Gaaah!"

[Miki]
"Ny'nuuuh!"
//... -GHS

We enjoyed a game of Sepak Takraw with swimming in addition.
//http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Sepak+Takraw&l=1 -GHS
And then lunch.

[Taichi]
"Wheeew... making the playfield out in the sea made me sooo tired."

[Miki]
"More like playing, it feels like we've come to squeeze out bodily strength."
//I'm having just this impression, OK, it's just me but I sort of think this might just mean sex. Don't hold me to that now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So that game was a failure, right."

[Miki]
"Having to move via swimming is... insane! That's something only mermaids could play."

[Taichi]
"Teenagers don't need sanity you know!"
[Taichi]
"Well then, is it done then?"

[Miki]
"It is indeed."

Riding our chins in duo on the cheapish table, we stare at those two portions of meal laid out for us:
cup ramen.

[Taichi]
"SlrpSlrpSlrp."

[Miki]
"GbleGbleGble."
//off-brand gobble-gobble??????? -GHS

[Taichi]
"We're at the seaside therefore we should have ramen, of course, but still... this's wretched!"

[Miki]
"...it is."

[Taichi]
"Yours looks tasty tho."

[Miki]
"Curry flavor."
//COUGH COUGH COUGH COOOOUGH -GHS

[Taichi]
"Give it a swap."

[Miki]
"Of course, here."

[Taichi]
"...ah, delicious. Was there more of this?"
//See CCD0002. Taichi likes curry now. -GHS

[Miki]
"I packed to fill, have a look please."

Only a few of the containers had split in the crash.

[Taichi]
"Thinking again, it's not like we needed dozens of packages of ramen in a cup."
//Different term, see below -GHS

[Miki]
"...my life is still safe because I was holding on to these, so don't forget it."
//They probably absorbed the impact. -GHS

On the way, we had an accident.
//HACK dim screen and new lines! -GHS

[Miki]
"Y-Y-Y-Y-Your driving is ○×△□＄＃％＆○×△□＄＃％＆!!!!!!!!"
//HACK !!!MItouKI!!! really, that's PCP CCB0004C. -GHS

She was waaay angry. And crying at the same time.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"...yes, sorry..."

[Miki]
"There, there."
//HACK 2 more lines -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, this one looks good."

I take one out.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm... but why is there no hole to pour the water in?"
[Taichi]
"And what's with the ingredients. This ain't ramen is it?"

[Miki]
"Hmoh?"

[Taichi]
"Maybe it's freeze-dried tofu... no, it's totally spongy... and it's soaked in some sort of viscous fluid..."
[Taichi]
"Wait, ain't this a pussy in a cup!!!"
//Mirrors 'ramen in a cup'. Term googles, but Jlist also sells them like this so it should be clear enough. See CCB0008B. The owner of Atomic GS doesn't just put normal and pervy panties next to each other, but also cup pussies and cup ramen. That's less perverted and more just dumb. -GHS

I tossed it at Miki.

[Miki]
"Gyah?"
//HACK independent doll shake (this scene is cut from all console versions, so guessing) -GHS

My aim was true.

[Taichi]
"Why you shameless virgin...! You dumbass!"

[Miki]
"What'd I do now!"

[Taichi]
"Have a good look yourself at what you crammed in together with ramen!"
//"Tsukkonda" comes from tsukkomi, so there's sort of that gag too... I guess. It's lame enough that it's not missed if so. -GHS

[Miki]
"...hmmm? What's even this?"

[Taichi]
"Cup pussy."
//This also works on Jlist. -GHS

[Miki]
"'Cup pussy'?"

[Taichi]
"Bearing in mind the naughty thing you just uttered, in short it's a sexual aid. I don't really like 'em, but they're single use and run between 500 to 900 yen or thereabouts!"
//TL Note: may be a novelty item in applicable countries. Also, seeing CCD5001 and the rest, I wonder if that's what Youko really is. 5+9=7x2, as 700 (7) is exactly the number in between the two prices. -GHS

[Miki]
"...method of employment incomprehensible."

Should I just use it in front of your eyes... you wee lass.
//BTW, I'm not joking, they'll send you killers if you don't use 'wee' before 'lass'. I saw them, they got the kilt and the hairy legs and the beard and the red hair and, of course, their weapon of choice is a blowgun built into bagpipes. Those guys do *not* screw around. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oooh, if you are so defenseless then onii-san will worry!"
//now she's an imouto. Well, see end of route. Indeed. -GHS-desu

[Miki]
"Ah, huh... but I did get a fair amount of knowledge, really, thanks to a certain someone."
[Miki]
"Girls at this age who know about maintenance of artificial vaginas ain't so many."
//Seems the joke is that she didn't associate 'pussy in a cup' with 'artificial vagina', so she knows. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uwehon! Ain't it hot today."
//Seem just a weird SFX. Odd change of subject, maybe his embarrassment, maybe this joke just fell down dead. -GHS

Though it isn't hot.

[Miki]
"...hey, more importantly, did you notice?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"No fish, no crabs, there's nothing at all in the sea."

[Taichi]
"...yep, noticed. No shellfish either. Just the shells."
//Maybe it's just too well maintained... maybe it's just too polluted. Or she's asking to confirm whether there should be anything. -GHS

[Miki]
"I found a Shiny Tellin shell. So pretty! I'm taking it home."
//Specific term is Nitidotellina Nitidula, but the above seems to google as well. Guess what it looks like before googling it! -GHS

[Taichi]
"There weren't any Octopus Giganteuses either.
//BTW, this is a hint for the above. -GHS

[Miki]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"Well, let's not put too much focus on those thereabouts. It'll be scientifically unmasked."
//He actually went and said it. Indeed, giant octopussy is about as credible as anything scientific in Cross Channel. Giant octopuses too, I guess. -GHS

[Miki]
"...nah, I wasn't trying to straight-man, I was just thinking, what a desolate world this is."
[Miki]
"The world is so desolate, that's what."

[Taichi]
"Mh-hmmm."

The world is desolate, yes.
It does seem to be.
//HACK more new lines, whoa. -GHS

[Miki]
"Do we just... have to live in this world, somehow or somehow, then...?"

[Taichi]
"Lonely?"
//Ohhh, nasty question. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"Shall we make lots of kids?"

[Miki]
"...at this point just do as you like, please."

Half disgusted, half resigned.

[Taichi]
"Weeee!"

Now that permission has been graciously granted, we can perform Creation with a lot of children!
//~CURIEITO~ -GHS

[Taichi]
"...but I won't, nope."

[Miki]
"Mh?"

[Taichi]
"Well, shall we keep playing?"

[Miki]
"Yesss's!"
//Lit. "the exclamation mark of Yesss". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Next up we have Night Wrestling."

[Miki]
"...are we beating around the bush, are we not, just incomprehensible..."
//Below is old. -GHS

/Miki: "Well, shall we play!"
/Taichi: "Indeed, next up we have Night Wrestling."
/美希「……それせっくすって言いませんか……ふつー」
/Miki: "...isn't that just a name for sex... laaame."

[Miki]
"That was so fuuun!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed. Let's go again."

[Miki]
"Yeppers!"

[Status]
mostly returned to good spirits.

[Taichi]
"Ah, those pictures you took today, how long would it take to develop them?"

[Miki]
"Do you want them quickly?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. If possible before tomorrow night."

[Miki]
"So soon... then, I'll be developing them at school, and I'll deliver them to you there."

[Taichi]
"Thank ye. Bye-byez!"

[Miki]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Miki]
"Uhmmm, no, it is nothing at all. Bye!"
//HACK SFX -GHS

She ran off towards the apartment building.
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
It's Saturday.
...one more day.
There is one more day.

[Miki]
"Good morning, you're in so early."

[Taichi]
"I really want those photographs, that's all."
//HACK it's not THAT desperate -GHS

[Miki]
"I'll be developing them right now. It takes time!"

[Taichi]
"It's OK, at your leisure."

[Miki]
"Won't you come with me?"

[Taichi]
"...aaah, I'll just be idling here."

[Miki]
"Right then."

A bit despondent.

[Miki]
"Let's have lunch together."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Miki leaves.
I think about this weekend.
Whether she likes it or not,
I will be sending her back, in wholesomeness.
One by one I will engrave all the casual nonchalant conversations with Miki on my heart.

[Taichi]
"Forget it, I'm going."

I headed towards the Photography Club's club room.
//Isn't it odd that Gunjou has so few Experts, so few people who can communicate, yet apparently this many clubs? Yutaka was in another, for that matter, and however much of joke it might have been, playing Baseball Pinball is (as far as I can find) a collaborative effort as well. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ehhh?"

[Miki]
"...I'm coming iiin!"

She came.
A huge hand luggage,
scent of soap,
a new uniform.
This means...

[Miki]
"You're emitting a strange aura, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"...ahem, that's ruuude."

[Miki]
"That's one cramped hotel you got here, Mr. Manager."

[Taichi]
"Ah, we have a most favorable reputations among guests with phobia of wide spaces."

[Miki]
"...or so I joke, but it's bigger than my house."

[Taichi]
"C'mon!"
//HACK come on, at least don't make her teleport... -GHS

[Miki]
"Awah-awah, 'maaazing, a wooden floor!"
//Vs. tatami mats? ...dirt? -GHS

[Taichi]
"In this town's normal. Everybody's bursting with money after all."

[Miki]
"My folks live in the super-cheap multi-unit apartment block left over from when the town was poor."
//The rising tide didn't lift all boats it seems. True for real life, given it's the Nations of the World concept at work in this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... that abandoned building, right."
//It's a joke... or is it? Who knows in this thing. -GHS

[Miki]
"It doesn't have an elevator, so when electricity stopped it was toootally alriiight!"

[Taichi]
"What floor's your apartment, then?"
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"...top floor."
//And that's why she's still thin despite eating all that crap. ~fin~ -GHS

[Taichi]
"You may cry. My dear, you may cry."

[Miki]
"Bwaaah! Now my days of climbing stairs are over!"

[Taichi]
"Pathetic..."

[Miki]
"Then, since I am in your sympathy, please show me to a room."
//See CCC3012B. Now SHE's Sakuraba. -GHSAKURABAISMIKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIasdklpszdvi90oewX

[Taichi]
"Here, ma'am."

[Miki]
"That's yer room!"

[Taichi]
"For you to have come to the house of a man means..."

[Miki]
"Ahhh, I gett'it..."
//Kansai -GHS

[Taichi]
"I do value your honesty."

[Miki]
"Uhm, Senpai. Can I please have but one question?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah?"

[Miki]
"What about the room next door...?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, that's no good."
[Taichi]
"Wanna go see?"
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes...?"

I let her go,
and she returned with looks altered.

[Miki]
"...th-th-there's an entire wall just bwoom! covered with your photographs Senpai!!!"
//Same SFX for humanity's disappearance, see CCC0006B. Also see CCB2005 - stalker's flavor indeed. ...however, compared to how Taichi keeps asking for pictures... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Terrifying, right?"

[Miki]
"It tears me apart."

[Taichi]
"Well, let's go without direct contact."
[Taichi]
"Ergo, the floor of this room will become your berth."
[Taichi]
"Here, sleeping bag."
//HACK earlier -GHS

Miki stares fixedly at the cylindrical-shaped sleeping bag.
//its cylindrical like a penis -GHS

[Miki]
"Making a girl who came requesting assistance sleep in a bag, whaaat is this even about now?"
//Sooo Touko now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It has been decided that guests go on the floor in this house."
[Taichi]
"If you wish to sleep in a futon, then you shall have to surmount the 100 Trials of Kurosu Taichi."

In short it means sex.

[Miki]
"..."

Out comes the anguish.

[Taichi]
"Come now, come now."
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Mikiii?"
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"I'll be pranking youuu."
//HACK -GHS

She looks up at me and,
//HACK earlier end music -GHS

[Miki]
"Go on."
//HACK no need -GHS
[Miki]
"I have steeled my resolve."

Her tone of voice was so earnestly serious that it left me bewildered.

[Taichi]
"Oookay... let me rephrase that now. I was kidding."
[Taichi]
"Or more like, I didn't scare you, right?"

[Miki]
"I am... scared."

[Taichi]
"Did I...?"

Miki shakes her head left and right.

[Miki]
"There's no one, that's what's scary."

[Taichi]
"That's the one then."

[Miki]
"What happened to Kiri? Why has she gone away?"

[Taichi]
"I don't get that."
//Same "lie" as Nanaka: focus on understanding, not knowing. -GHS

[Miki]
"Will I vanish too? And you too, Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Miki]
"I feel like I'm... going mad."
[Miki]
"...hold me, Senpai."
[Miki]
"So that I won't disappear..."

And on so saying, she leans onto me.
What can I do but catch her.
//HACK Given the sex scene was removed very very brutally, we can implement the Sex Alt scene! Yay! -GHS
If it hadn't been night, I could've managed to resist, maybe,
but with the mood that now envelops the two of us, that ability to refuse had now gone.

[Taichi]
"...I'll hold you, yes."

As I stroke my hands in a circle on her back, lightly, Miki clings to me even more.
So will this be, itself,
one more memory perhaps---
//HACK back -GHS
Slowly I lay down Miki.
JMP N_SCENE001
:SCENE001
:N_SCENE001
We kissed.

[Miki]
"Nh... nAh... hnh."

Astonished at the smallness of her lips,
so thin, and of delicate make.
Slowly becoming wet, with a softness that stuns me.
Light pecks.
Peck-like kissing.
Distancing the touch to vary the angle just a little.

[Miki]
"That tickles... really, ah... hah..."

Chatting at the height of kissing means defeat.
And so, I put in the tongue.
Miki's body goes rigid.
I hold her tightly, that she can't escape.
And suck, and suck, and suck...
So as to draw that sweet honey in through the mouth.
I begin stripping her of clothes.
//Hum, but she has her uniform on... -GHS
On releasing her lips, puzzlement and a strained smile were coexisting on Miki's face.
I trace the nape of her neck with the lips.

[Miki]
"Easy now, easy now... nggg〜h!"

A tiny breathing motion in her clavicle.

[Taichi]
"You are amazingly sensitive, really."

[Miki]
"Nggg〜〜〜〜〜h!!!"

She covers her face with the back of her hand.

[Miki]
"...sort of... amazing..."

[Taichi]
"What's amazing?"

[Miki]
"Being touched by someone, it's... amazing... kYahUh!"

[Taichi]
"Yes."

My lips descend down below.
My journey downwards is demarcated by the shuddering quivering of Miki's abdominal muscles.
//You can tell it's been a while since the last one. -GHS
Her abdomen, breathing so faintly, is so beautiful it excites me.
Even trying to think why is an annoyance.
I cling hard to Miki's lower extremities,
and I go kiss in there as well.

[Miki]
"...aaah... wha, time out..."

She begins making weird noises.
I diligently moisten that still childish part of her.
//Lolicon is a disease. -GHS
I suck on a protuberance that exists on the bow of the her ship model,
//The ship model'd be "female". Well, at least it's a ship pun instead of a fish pun. ...wait a second KINOKO NASUUUUUUUUUU-GHS
with strength.

[Miki]
"Ow... strong... too much!"

I lick with the tongue, and sometimes suck again.

[Miki]
"Ahhh, hurtsHURTS, feels like you're taking something ooo〜ff!"
//...see CCA0002? -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

'Something' like what?
//The Something that's Coming. Don't you know anything about eroge??? -GHS
I go easier on her.

[Miki]
"KyaUh... kyah... nh... aWahah..."

There is something oddly enjoyable in this act.
I hold it in the lips a bit, and play around with it a bit.

[Miki]
"Ah, hah... haah... nh..... uGuh!"

When I taste her vagina, Miki's breath becomes just a little bit shorter.

[Taichi]
"Still hurts?"

[Miki]
"...dunno... going numb... hYaaahnh!"

I churn with the tip of the tongue.

[Taichi]
"Like it like this?"

[Miki]
"Too gentle, nooo!"

Pick one...

[Miki]
"It's so embarrassing... I'll panic..."

[Taichi]
"I'm sticking my tongue in."

[Miki]
"Ah... it's in..."

Her defenseless voice turns into pleasant feelings for me.
I moved the tongue, assiduously.

[Miki]
"Ah... ahnh, ah, ahhnh... nh... hah."
[Miki]
"Nh, nnnh... uHnh, aHuh... nOO, something... coming upwards..."

Using a finger,
I lightly squish Miki's precious jewel.
//Sigh. -GHS

[Miki]
"Nnnh?! If you, pinch, there..."
[Miki]
"C-, come off, it will come off!"

[Taichi]
"It shall not come off."
//Formal. -GHS

I stretch my tongue outwards as far as it goes, and try to push it inside.

[Miki]
"NNNNNNNNH!!!"

Her back half-rising, Miki transforms into a bow.
//Moisture must've warped the ship. -GHS
The increase in moisture flows into my mouth.
............

[Taichi]
"Well, shall I enter you in the missionary?"

[Miki]
"...I don't care about the name of the sexual position or all that... just that it won't hurt... if possible."

[Taichi]
"It's the missionary so you'll be fine. It's the one most suited for the mission after all."
//Pun between "normal position" and "normal". Which doesn't make sense in English anyway, but it's about this bad. And now, it's also SYMBOLISM. -GHS

[Miki]
"Well then... missionary..."

[Taichi]
"Don't be so wound up."

[Miki]
"Nh... scary... it's scaaary!"

[Taichi]
"Let's go."

I push against her waist.

[Miki]
"Slowly, slowly! Slowly pleez!"
//At this point I'm just considering all sex scenes as actual comedy. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes, slooowly."

[Miki]
"Uggghh..."

[Taichi]
"Slooowly."

[Miki]
"Ngggh... uWah... aw!"

I pull out.

[Miki]
"...huuurts..."

[Taichi]
"I knew it, it hurts."
//May be because she's several years younger nowzzzz -GHS

[Miki]
"Guh..."

Tears float up to the corners of her eyes.

[Taichi]
"But right after this, miss, it's principal photography!"
//... -GHS

Miki's tears increased to large-grain with a 'bwaaah'.
//This is totally a pun between 'fuee' (crying) and 'fueru' (increase) is it. Sigh. -GHS

[Miki]
"Oh-, ohhh I've already cum!"

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha lie!"
[Taichi]
"But... if it hurts how about we stop?"

[Miki]
"Ah... that's also... bad..."

[Taichi]
"Whasseven yer opinion..."
//More random Kansai (seemingly) -GHS

[Miki]
"Just go on, and hug me tight, and we'll be great like that."

[Taichi]
"The purposes of man and woman just pass by each other and don't meet."

Well, we should be fine.
I hold her.

[Miki]
"...!"

I'm like some child's towel, aren't I.
//Is that a Peanuts reference I see? Not that it's uncommon, here's the top search result: http://komachi.yomiuri.co.jp/t/2012/0301/487686.htm?g=06 -GHS
Just something to be clung to.

[Miki]
"...and, I wanna know... will they all show up again..."

[Taichi]
"Better yet, let's make some."

[Miki]
"Ehhh... make you say... you don't mean?"

[Taichi]
"I will move."

The slide of life.
//BRB, going to walk into a wall. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah... nnnh... uwAh, I'm cramping up..."

I touch into a depth that the tongue could never reach.

[Miki]
"Ah, ah... ugh, uuuh..."

It feels like I'm pushing into a tiny pouch... and the feeling is likely correct.
//See CCC4022 (unsurprisingly) -GHS
There's this anxiety that stems from wondering, will I tear it open?
//Let's just not pretend this is anything but a comedy scene. -GHS
I move slowly.
When I pull back to the limit and again sink in, Miki endures with eyes tightly closed.

[Miki]
"Nh, ah... nnh...nGh... uWaaah, feels like, I'll break..."

Holding onto me, her breath going wild.

[Miki]
"Haaarsh..."

I'm sure blood came out.
I'd rather not see that.
//Because it might have not since they already had sex in her route. The only other girl we see a sex scene of in Sendback is Misato, her first time is suspiciously skipped through, and while Misato herself does refer to them having had sex "once", she refers to it as a suspicious "that time". The CG is silent. -GHS
To shake that off, I go kiss.

[Miki]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry... I feel like I'm breaking, too."

It felt like a bomb was buried deep inside my hips,
and that I wanted to dislodge it.
//See CCD1001. His beast is and remains his sex drive. -GHS
I wanted to expel it all out.
When I push with a jerk in the hips, the tip strikes her wall.

[Miki]
"Hahnh... that's... there's..."

So shallow. So tight.
And therefore,

[Taichi]
"...hurts."

It feels like I'm being immobilized.
//See CCD5001. Heh. -GHS
I go around and around that inside lubricated by an inexhaustible supply of oil.
//往復 -GHS

[Miki]
"uHyy, hyAhnh, ah, ah, nh, hahahhh..."

At times I interpose twitching strokes, accelerating.

[Miki]
"Senpai, no, no more..."

[Taichi]
"More, more!"

[Miki]
"No waaay, uuh, uh, aAhnh, nh, nh, ahnh!"

A thick slime covers her vaginal channel.
The watery sound increases in viscosity with each thrust.

[Taichi]
"Your insides are getting better, Miki."

[Miki]
"Really now, dun, dunno... nnnh!"

Miki's body loses strength.

[Miki]
"Hah, hah, haaaa~~~aah, ah... nh, unnnh, no, dooon't..."

[Taichi]
"You're putting the full stop a bit early there..."

[Miki]
"But, it's so, violent..."

[Taichi]
"How about this, how does this feel?'

Tiny thrusts.

[Miki]
"aHaHaHaHaHaHaH!"
//あっx7 -GHS

Her voice leaped up. And her body, too.
As if she had regained vitality.

[Taichi]
"'Round here, then."

I move at an angle that twists her vagina.

[Miki]
"uHYYYh, ah, aah, nh, nh, nnnh〜〜〜〜〜h!"
[Miki]
"It's entering all slippery... KYAHnh... it's inside!"

[Taichi]
"Just entering?"

As I bite her ear I whisper,

[Taichi]
"It's going in and it's going out you know?"

[Miki]
"Out, and in... uuuhn, nh... hahnh... de-, deee〜〜〜〜〜ep, a~~~h!"

Miki's depths are surprisingly close.
//She's relatively shallow after all. How obvious is her Genius Loli archetype compared to Touko's tsundere? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Like this, then."

[Miki]
"Kyah, ahnh, don't, walls, dooon't!"

[Taichi]
"Like this, then."

[Miki]
"Kyaaah, ah, scrubbing the walls dooon't!"

[Taichi]
"Hurts?"

[Miki]
"Doesn't hurt... dangerous..."

An inexplicable way of putting it.

[Taichi]
"I like dangerous things."

I press Miki down using my whole body.

[Miki]
"Fwah, nh, ah, do not, Senpai don't, I told you dooon't! ...ng'yh... NNNNNNH!!!"

[Taichi]
"Sorry..."

The heat of the act heats up my head.
I can't stop.
//See CCA0002. Maybe. Head... going... numbzzzzz -GHS

[Miki]
"Fwah, uh... aaah, hahnh, nh, ah, aGhnh..."

My thighs draw a circle lasciviously.
The walls adhere, creating adsorption.
//See CCC4022, still aDsorption. ...wait a second, that's just recycling stuff!!! I wouldn't forgive it but zzz -GHS
When I pull myself outside, numbness runs from the tailbone to the spinal cord.

[Miki]
"Uuugh, ahNh, ah, ah... aaah... aUh!"
[Miki]
"Ah... something, comes, what..."
//Seems she doesn't know what's coming herself. Dammit, you both fail at eroge! -GHS

[Taichi]
"You got some talent, don'tcha!"

[Miki]
"Nnh... what sort of... talent... hAhnh!"

[Taichi]
"Talent at, feeling good and, lots!"
//Broken up. See CCD1001B. Always repeating 'em lines. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ngh... really... dummy...!"
//Hi Touko. Youko. Kiri. Everyone. -GHS

I hugged her closer,
and am held in return.
We become one as far as we can do so.
Abruptly, I remember that this is the very last time I can make memories with Miki.
And also realize that I was feeling like ejaculating until right before I thought that.
The senses had grown dull with arousal.

[Taichi]
"!!!"

I stab over and over Miki's insides, so many times.
A violently aggressive regular motion: a rhythm.

[Miki]
"Ah... aHaHaHaH, don't, dooon't, dangerous, nh, nh, nnnnnnnh〜〜〜〜〜!!!"

I come without a scream nor hard breathing.
It's clump of ecstatic joy, chiseled by tiny words only as the aftermath.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

And that I push inside,
to the deepest depths,
still hugging, separation still impossible.
As if the very cells of our bodies were attempting to merge.
//And the two shall become one flesh. -GHS
I continue pouring out,
until it feels my hips would go in as well.
And then, collapse.
Two people, overlapping.
Casual, artless kissing.
I hold tiny little Miki at my breast.

[Miki]
"A baby... we made... one..."

[Taichi]
"...you serious, now."

[Miki]
"Sixth... sense..."
//Nah, just the marriage metaphor. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."

Maybe joking, maybe serious, hard to tell.
The feeling of being so close to 'that' Miki is... nostalgic.
//Old Miki. Wait, Young Miki. No, it's, uhm... curse her loli logic! -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're so adorable, Miki."

I held her at my breast, as if she were a doll,
//Wonder if she's actually one ~uryuu~. -GHS
feeling the proximity of the heat radiated by our act.
Sweet body odor, wafting in.

[Taichi]
"...Miki?"

[Miki]
"............"

She was asleep.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah."

Easygoing isn't she.
$SNCCD4003 = 1
IF $KAISOU == 0 JMP N_SCENE101
:N_SCENE101
I wiped down Miki's body,
fully opened the window,
hugged her,
and slept.

[Taichi]
"...hahah."

I knew it.
So tiny and so warm.
That was what Miki was.
//HACK direct to doll -GHS
Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS

[Miki]
"What? A picnic?"

[Taichi]
"Yup."

Sunday.
I made that proposal as we were having breakfast.
//...with what? -GHS

[Miki]
"It's Sunday, after all."

[Taichi]
"I got things ready."

[Miki]
"You're serious. So quick..."

She stares at the basket, very fixedly.

[Miki]
"Hmmm, is this a Pervy Picnic, right?"

And she smiles.

[Taichi]
"I've been found out..."

[Miki]
"Whoa, this guy's disgusting."

[Taichi]
"Isn't it a good thing anyway? We don't have anything else to do."

[Miki]
"I keep thinking, ah, if only this guy here had some romantic feelings..."
//Touko and Misato. -GHS

[Taichi]
"One cannot live on romance alone."
//...ramen pun? -GHS

[Miki]
"...so raunchy."

[Taichi]
"And with that said, let's go. I'll be bringing the Devices and the costumes."

[Miki]
"Wh-, what will be done to you, myself..."
[Miki]
"And up the mountain too."

[Taichi]
"Who knows!"

[Miki]
"Ngggh, and my down-there still huuurts..."
[Miki]
"So, what'll happen to me?"

[Taichi]
"Once we go you should understand, but... let's say I'll send you out of your comfort zone."
//SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Miki]
"Bweeeh! (tears)"

Perhaps accustomed to my psychedelic conduct, Miki accompanies me without display of suspicion.
//Ahhh, so he's also dropping acid? Besides obviously meaning something else that starts with 'psych'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You have both your parents if I remember, right Miki?"

[Miki]
"I do, yes."
[Miki]
"They're two unwealthy parents."
[Miki]
"Oh, wait, they were."
//So broken up about it(!). -GHS

Past tense.

[Taichi]
"Ah, my bad."

[Miki]
"Ahah, but everybody's gone so we're alll the same!♪"

[Taichi]
"You a pauper then."
//All are equal in death... -GHS

[Miki]
"My allowance is so small."

[Taichi]
"How much?"

[Miki]
"3,000 yen."

Whoooaaa...
That's really cheap.

[Taichi]
"Ya can't buy nothing!"

[Miki]
"Savings are important."
//HACK -GHS
[Miki]
"And then there's the New Year's Gift."
[Miki]
"When I was sentenced to go to Gunjou, I got a lot of money as gift."
[Miki]
"...and what exactly did that even mean!"
//Hmmm, this one seems a reference or something but I got nothing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...who knows."

Ignorance is the custom of the blissful.
//HACK tweaked in the 360 version (was just removed in the PS2). Original is "ignorance is bliss", but now it reads a little off. I suspect it's intentional. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, whatever happens, saving is going to be important once again, I'm sure."

[Miki]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"We're here."
//HACK -GHS

[Miki]
"...a hokora."

[Taichi]
"C'mere."

[Miki]
"We're doing it heeere...? I don't have veto powers right?"

[Taichi]
"Right."
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"Awww!"

[Taichi]
"Gladden me with holding onto this radio."

[Miki]
"...how does this playact work?"
//Like with a mop, except more denpa. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, once you switch completely to the other side you'll immediately understand the situation."

[Miki]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Walk this way, straight and slow."

[Miki]
"??????"

[Taichi]
"C'mon! C'mon!"

[Miki]
"Really, what's that mean..."

[Taichi]
"Walk! Walk!"
//Don't. Blink. -GHS

[Miki]
"Uh-, huuuh..."

Niiice.

[Taichi]
"Stopp'. No moving now."
[Taichi]
"Right then, now take a pose."

[Miki]
"Like?"

[Taichi]
"A pose of your own, a my-pose."
//Doesn't seem to be a specific sexual pose, and it's always worth nothing when Japanese words lack a secondary sexual meaning. Or at least it's faster to. -GHS

[Miki]
"...don't, I really don't have one of those... what do I do!"

[Taichi]
"Just do something, then."
//It's of course one of the poses of the advertising material, see CCA0004, there's still something of that in the game. Yet, look at Kiri's poses. There's still imitative behavior. -GHS

[Miki]
"...something like this?"

[Taichi]
"............"

[Miki]
"...uhmmm?"

[Taichi]
"Yup, I've burned it in my retina."
//What's left of it. -GHS

[Miki]
"What are you trying to start now..."

[Taichi]
"Miki, I'm going to give you a prophecy."
//Well, he IS a prophet in more than a few senses. -GHS
[Taichi]
"You will, in the near future, become one tuff guy."

[Miki]
"Ought I infer the meaning to be that I shall have a sex change?"

[Taichi]
"You'll become a good woman."

[Miki]
"Waaah!"
//See CCA0027. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Keep these words of mine with you as you accumulate experience, you'll become something good but quick:"
[Taichi]
"the letter X is the one capable of crossing!"
//See CCD1001 -GHS

[Miki]
"...hm?"

[Taichi]
"What, don'tcha get what that means? I just said something really emotional now!"

[Miki]
"...this crossing thing, isn't it just passing by each other without really meeting?"

[Taichi]
"Bwaaah, don't say thaaat! It just depends on the way you see things!"

[Miki]
"Ahahah."
[Miki]
"Senpai, your depths are ever unchangingly profound, and Miki can't understand them well."

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

[Miki]
"My first impression of you was that of a weirdo, Senpai, and my impression of you now is also that of a weirdo."

[Taichi]
"Haven't gotten up that social ladder at all, have I."

[Miki]
"And that's who this Miki got Paired to, so use me as you will!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed. Bear me a good child!"
[Taichi]
"Ahhh, it's too bad that I can't teach you all about the dazzling heights of pleasure."

Too bad, seriously.
Hyper bad, in every way.
Regrettable.

[Miki]
"Uhm, what's been all this?"
//Still. No. Blinking. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Byez then."

I wave my hand.

[Miki]
"Uhm..."

[Taichi]
"Come on, raise your hand."

[Miki]
"Yes... but,"

[Taichi]
"Smile!"

[Miki]
"But now..."
[Miki]
"This look like we're parting, doesn't it?"

[Taichi]
"It doesn't?"

[Miki]
"This is weird... Senpai..."

[Taichi]
"Me, just maybe, I might've wanted someone Miki-like as a daughter or as a sister, I think."
//Final bullshit. Miki's the only girl he falls for that can play with him on equal ground, and who isn't Solitary somehow. She's totally meant to be his True Waifu. -GHS

Miki's eyes opened wide,
and that instant,
a scarlet twilight came.

[Taichi]
"It was waaay fun. Byez then."

[Miki]
"Senpai, don't!"

Shutter click---
Faster than she could tread forwards,
she was sent back.

[Miki]
"...ah... eh?"
[Miki]
"Senpai, I said!"
[Miki]
"...what?"
[Miki]
"WhatWhat?"
[Miki]
"Gooone! In a second!"
//Like Youko can. -GHS
[Miki]
"Taichi-senpai, where are youuu?!"
[Miki]
"Deary, the radio's making noise?"
//Wow, that's girly... -GHS
[Miki]
"......eh, what's this..."
[Miki]
"The radio making noise means then it's receiving a signal, which means... there are radio waves, which means..."
[Miki]
"Ah..."
[Miki]
"City lights."
[Miki]
"People... are there..."
[Miki]
"UhWahWah, this is serious!"
[Miki]
"Senpai, I say, people and the radio and the town and I said!"
[Miki]
"Not here... where..."
[Miki]
"I will be going on ahead!!!"
//HACK disconnected. This was missing from all the routes but Misato's. -GHS
HACK night -GHS

I became alone.
Once again the consciousness of one whole person had vanished from the world.
//Not her physical body, though. Both metaphorically and literally she's not gone. -GHS
Even then,

[Taichi]
"...she could guess, huh."

At the last instant,
her words, "don't", what meaning could they have had?
Even if I don't believe she could have understood that anything concrete would be happening.
//Well, maybe nothing concrete did. -GHS
So this... is something that may be possible to convey it.
//Well, you could've been less cryptic about it dammit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But it'd be best if she didn't actually get pregnant, no."
[Taichi]
"Well, but if she did that would be exciting, I guess."
[Taichi]
"...which will it be."
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

       And as I was thinking about that---
//This and Sakuraba's are the only two that are different in all the Sendback routes. -GHS
