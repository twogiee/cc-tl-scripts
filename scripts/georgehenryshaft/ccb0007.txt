I met a crouching maiden while on my way back to the classroom.
//Actually had to change quite a bit since the two fragments don't seem to flow. -GHS
It's Miki.
Yamanobe Miki.

[Taichi]
"Yo there!"

[Miki]
"!!!?"

Miki stands straight up.
Very sudden behavior.
//Very suspicious, too. -GHS
Slowly she turned around.

[Miki]
"Ah, Senpai... hello."

She raises her head and nods in salutation.
Miki's style is an ever unchanging, bluff-less thing.
//See CCA0008, more reading key for the wind (now gone). -GHS
A vague sense of physical discomfort.
//Specific recurring term -GHS
Was Miki always this determined and strong?
//Vague. -GHS
That quality was there from the start, yes, but it feels she has gone around the block once or twice with regards to strength of willpower.
//Lit. "incomparably [stronger] than before", but keeping closer to the original since it hints about her not resetting. -GHS
That's the feeling she evokes.

[Taichi]
"What'cha doing?"

[Miki]
"Cleaning."

[Taichi]
"What a coincidence, I'm scrubbing."
//Adaptation Hell begins! -GHS

[Miki]
"Is that a superficial wordplay with your idea of my physical characteristics and your parentage?"
//farewell+resemblance+cleaning -> cleaning+she's flat+he's a bastard -GHS

[Taichi]
"...it is not!"
//Suddenly formal -GHS

[Miki]
"Why all angry?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"Why all silent?"

[Taichi]
"Don't hurry me with that when I don't have a comebaaack!"

[Miki]
"Weeee, I wooon!"

Stronger willpower.
//Same as above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, just thought this one:"

I clear my throat.

[Taichi]
"...humanity I have scrubbed!"
//Fits the pun and the implication that he sent humanity away. そうじ (ignoring kanji) does have several more meanings that may be applicable, but it's really really minor stuff. -GHS

[Miki]
"Then you're the culprit you bastaaard!"
//Miki's quick to accuse him, inn'she. It's as if she knew. -GHS

[Taichi]
"H'yaaa!"

Two people in a struggle.

[Taichi]
"Y'oh!"
[Taichi]
"H'oh!"
[Taichi]
"...huh?"
[Taichi]
"OH?!"

Smacked with one blow to the torso.
Ugh, so strong, but how?
To hit I, the Master of Karade!

[Taichi]
"How dare you!"

It got just a smidgen serious.

[Miki]
"Sh'uh!"
//It's totally "shoe" isn't it. -GHS

A flexible leg rose higher than her hips.
I was thinking how to sweep off the leg she uses as axle, but through the gap, I saw panties.
//Recurring term. Unfortunately more than a bit forced here. "White" removed in the console version not for censorship (for once), but because, well, they're definitely not. -GHS
Attack suspension.
To Taichi the Man not looking at panties sacrificed to his sight is an effeminate choice that does not exists.
//Intended to be ironic given his gender issues. -GHS

:CONTINUE
Indeed, it doesn't.
I dropped my gaze to below the hips.
The kick comes.
As per Karade, I steady myself to take it in the mid-section.
In the space between the arms, the tip of the toes softly breaches through.

[Taichi]
"The-?"

Can't be.
It's a chin hit.
//Vs. clean hit...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh my my?"

I lost consciousness.
...
......
.........

[Taichi]
Huh?"

[Miki]
"Ah, I'm so glad! Did you recover now?"
//That can mean 'did you come back to senses?' just as much as 'have you realized now?'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh, ugggh... how long have I been out?"

[Miki]
"Not even a minute!"
//That'd be up to ten minutes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awww, and in the end Miki beat meee!"

I pound my lap.
//...I actually think that's intended to sound dirty... -GHS

[Miki]
"Tahah."
[Miki]
"But you were really off-guard, weren't you?"

[Taichi]
"Naaah, it was because there were no other choices for me..."
//See CCB0002. Not so funny anymore, is it. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...perhaps, even if my life was at stake, that wouldn't have changed."

[Miki]
"Life for panties?!"

[Taichi]
"Tsk, tsk, tsk!"

I show her a wiggling finger.

[Taichi]
"For the live show of 'serious' panties worn by an amateur girl, that's what!"
//Since they're sex panties... -GHS

[Miki]
"Not true..."

[Taichi]
"So true. Like THIS!---"

Snatch!
//hee hee -GHS
Loving fingers pinch the hem of my loved pupil's short skirt.
And a scissor of fingers cleanly pushes them away!

[Taichi]
"Huh, blocked?!"

[Miki]
"Hohohoh!"

Shock!

[Taichi]
"Yee-ep. It's complete mastery."

I grab back my stretched-out knees, and hug them until I look as round as a fried shrimp.
//See CCB0006 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then it's an oily good time for me to retire."
//Shrimp + shiyu (fatty oil) = fried shrimp. -GHS

[Miki]
"Oily, you sayly..."
//And here it is. -GHS

I was shaken and quaked like a certain too yu-ng girl.
//Yusa-yusa is actually an SFX. -GHS

[Miki]
"Shishou, please stay strong!"

[Taichi]
"'s fine. Hikikomori now."
//See CCB0006 -GHS

[Miki]
"He's started it again, this guy..."
[Miki]
"..."
[Miki]
"Nothing at all... despite that."

[Taichi]
"Oui?"

I return that question like a Frenchman.

[Miki]
"When it's all normal with everyone."
//These are of course very vague. Likely refers to how Taichi refuses to follow predicted patterns like everyone else. -GHS

Her voice quivers. Suddenly.

[Taichi]
"Miki-Miki?"

[Miki]
"Look, my hands are shaking this much."

She opens out her hands, and they are sweaty as if numb with cold.
Exactly as if she had become frightened.

[Taichi]
"...why?"

[Miki]
"That's because, when affected by Senpai's straining at the mental pressure, cowardly little Miki just jumps all into the jitter-jitters."
//Third person -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Miki]
"Therefore, please stay strong."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Seems she's cheering me on.
I do worry as things are a bit odd, though.
Ye-ep, let's just puff those cheeks and give a good smile, won't we.
//Although the console version seems to relate this to powaru (sexual delusions), ポワワ keeps returning as ポワワーン, which means the above. Maybe he's just trying to ignore suspicions, seems to fit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, how about we formalize this mastery of yours?"

I make a fist as if throwing rock.
//That's what it also means. Well, she DID play scissors before... -GHS

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Out with your notebook!"

[Miki]
"...ahh, yeah... that one, yes."
[Miki]
"Really been a long while there."

She makes a face that looks very pained.
Or should I say (should I say?), isn't she as if about to cry (about to cry?).
I thought that in a parallel multiplex didn't I.
//It's changing to parallel universes instead of sequentiality! SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
Miki takes out her Matebook.
So is called this intrascholastic ID booklet with a second role, named after the high-class bathhouse #1 in popularity located in the popular spot behind the main City's train station, MateBook.
Named after my ass!, I straight-man myself.
In truth it's just a coincidence.
//badum-tish -GHS

[Miki]
"...sob."

[Taichi]
"What's wrong?"

She's crying.
Or should I say (or should I say?), she's crying (she's crying?).
I thought that in a parallel multiplex didn't I.

[Taichi]
"...as I thought, that was something quite shocking wasn't it?"
//There's also the shock above, so staying wary on subject. -GHS

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"That the world would end up like this."

[Miki]
"Ah..."

There was a subtle effect.
//On her, I guess? Though technically there were advantages for him in a sense, it doesn't flow either way. -GHS

[Miki]
"So it did, so it seems."

[Taichi]
"Isn't it."
[Taichi]
"Gave me a scare too, this stuff."

[Miki]
"Senpai, too?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."
[Taichi]
"Now, all opportunities to meet Unnew Potatoes New Virgins of 13 or 15 years of age are all gone."
//See CCB2002 for New Potatoes. Seems to mean "new first graders of Junior and High school". Going by Wiki, he picked the earliest age where one should be out of elementary school, and the youngest for being in High. That's why it's not 12 and 15. Of course 3+5=8 and 2+5=7; he's making the usual 7 vs. 8 mistake due to him being messy about the timeline of things. Uncertain of the potato comparison, actually. -GHS

[Miki]
"That's the point then."
//Bit disdainful. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is."

I accept the notebook.

[Taichi]
"You've been using this notebook thoroughly, Miki. It's all worn!"

[Miki]
"All worn."

Miki assents by meaninglessly repeating my words.
Flipping the pages, I see annotation fields filled with my large-sized signature.
I pass by several pages.
This is beginning to look like a practice notebook for my signatures.
I find a blank page and there I fill out a fresh signature.
How long ago it was when we began to play?
//See CCC3004. -GHS
It's a silly innocent thing.
//See CCA0030 -GHS
I return the notebook.
Miki takes it, and hugs it to her chest,
squeezing it tightly.
As if holding the very ordinary days now lost.
Copying that, I go and wipe those tears now overflowing.
//Mosuru -GHS
Wah, me gentleman.
//Girly? -GHS

[Miki]
"Thank you..."

[Taichi]
"For what."

I pass my gaze on the corridor.

[Taichi]
"So anyway, cleaning are you."

[Miki]
"When the body is moving there is relaxation, it's said."
//That quoting particle って, with Miki, is all but a nuclear weapon, see CCB0012. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hummm..."
