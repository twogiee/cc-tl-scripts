I am awake.
//Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
Sunlight was piercing through the window.
Seems I have been hard asleep. I did not have any dreams.
The time is... 7AM.
There's no need to go to school or anything.
Yet, the body moved.
Breakfast was not served.
Of course.
Career beauty Mutsumi-obasan and her cooking so delicious are no more.
She had taken custody of me,
and she had amicably taken care of that thing with Youko-chan...
I had an indefinite amount of appreciation to give.
But before I could show filial piety, she had disappeared.
There's nothing decent to eat in this house.
I just drank water.
I often met with Yusa-chan on this road.
She took to me well.
She was this ticklish being...
I too went through so much hardship to become what I am now,
and the presence of Yusa-chan soothed me so much.
That girl is also no more.

[Sakuraba]
"Yo."

It was Sakuraba.

[Taichi]
"Yoh."

[Sakuraba]
"Hungry."

[Taichi]
"Me too."

[Sakuraba]
"You too?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

[Sakuraba]
"How trying."

[Taichi]
"Yup, trying."
[Taichi]
"Times like this, I just break into some ordinary home."
//Oddly specific term. The irony that he'd actually do so even if there were people. -GHS

I plunge into some residence nearby,
and return.

[Taichi]
"Got a big catch!"
//why not English? SUSPICIOUS. -GHS

That place was decked with preserved food.
//Egggggh. See CCC4003 for "payoff" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Look at this, it's Kanpan. And it's one of those with Konpeitos in it too!"
//It's also not impossible he just asked Yusa's mom for something to eat, and she gave him rations because she knows of his... problem. After all, the hint is that Yusa doesn't so much hate Taichi as he just stopped existing in her world. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...sniff!"
//Since it's not on Taichi, his sneeze does not create an hexagon. ...and I had another of those "what the hell am I writing" moments. -GHS

Sakuraba had mucus dangling from the nose.

[Taichi]
"...looks like I was right to take refuge."

[Sakuraba]
"I currently desire tissue."

[Taichi]
"Got none."

[Sakuraba]
"...hm. Then, nothing I can do."

And he went to walk on as he was.
The snot, hanging like an icicle, lambently dances left and right.
//See CCA0013. Like curry bread. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't just settle this with a 'nothing I can do'!"

I take out my handkerchief.

[Sakuraba]
"...sorry."

[Taichi]
"Do not give this back! Absolutely do not give this back get it? I'll do you in if you do!"

[Sakuraba]
"I come into your debt."

[Taichi]
"That one you repay!"
//Unfortunately the term's different... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Yup."
