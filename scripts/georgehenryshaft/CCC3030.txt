And then, Sunday.
Clear skies.
And the unknown territory not in the diaries, as well.
In what way the world will end on this day, I have no idea.
A week was... short.
The days ended up all being spent to finish the Kiri route.
//Since 'capture' is in that sense... -GHS
And yet,
the restart of club activities being was a godsend.
//Nooot eeeven tryyyiiing. -GHS
If my next self lays eyes on the notebooks, he will certainly have hints on how to arrange this all over again.
I beg for there to be happy times often and in so many ways,
inside this miniature garden beyond all salvation.
//See CCC0000. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Still nobody here, nope."

I pass my gaze on the surroundings.
On the spacious rooftop, a pipe canopy tent and machine parts,
//It's more like the one you get by googling パイプテント than the simple 'pipe tent'. -GHS
and the soaring antenna.
A blue sky crossed by not one radio wave.

[Kiri]
"...blue."

Kiri was looking up at the sky.

[Taichi]
"Not one cloud."

[Kiri]
"Indeed."

But Kiri's face still somehow reminded me of a dull cloudy gray sky.
The two of us cling to the fence,
shoulder to shoulder, with no conversation.
Eventually,

[Misato]
"Good morning."

everybody came by.

[Tomoki]
"...okieh."

Tomoki came, but he did definitely not talk to Mimi-senpai.

[Taichi]
"Thankee... when do we begin?"

[Misato]
"Uhmmm, I did not decide a specific time, but it is hereafter."
//Should be around 10, then, as usual. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"DJ?"

[Taichi]
"Hum, DJ indeed... who could do it...?"

No one raised their hand.

[Taichi]
"You, Mimi-senpai?"

[Misato]
"Eh, should I? No way, noway-noway, out of the question, I would swallow my tongue!"
//Not, necessarily saying she'd bite her tongue and die rather than do it but... interesting that she has no problem doing intraschool DJ, see CCD1001. Of course, this is the position as protagonist, it has nothing to do with being DJ at the antenna. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"...yhesh?"

She was in the very middle of tearing off a piece of beef jerky.
//Junk food for breakfast... at ten AM? Junk food for snack... this is totally what happens if Kiri's not there to hold her in place (sexual subtext). -GHS
Unbeautiful.
//美希しくない。 -GHS
...decruited.
//Euphemism for 'you're fired', should be a Dilbertism so it's acceptably '90s. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tomoki."

[Tomoki]
"No problem, but how much do I get?"
//Is Tomoki Jun from Family Project in drag...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

This is not what you'd call a problem of money.

[Taichi]
"Sakuraba..."

[Sakuraba]
"Do you think I of all people have any ability to talk about well-reasoned things?"
//Given the mess that was decoding his sermons... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ya know that well, don'tcha now, yes."
[Taichi]
"So then... Kiri?"

[Kiri]
"...eh!"

The color of her face changed.
Instantly she produces a most disagreeable sweat.

[Taichi]
"DJ!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, no way, out of the question, it's talking in front of people!"

[Taichi]
"Whaaat? They've all been wiped out anyway, so you're safe."

[Tomoki]
"What happened to the hope!"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

[Taichi]
"Geh'fuh!"

I had a chop implemented on me.
//See CCC3004, callback to his sister. -GHS

[Kiri]
"It's absurd, just no way it's impossible... it'll become all weird!"
//Imagine Cross Channel seen from Kiri's viewpoint. Damn. -GHS

She's jumping into stage fright with cold feet is-she-not.
//It just means 'recklessly abandoning herself' to stage fright, but that sounds silly in English. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'd like to see Kiri-chin all weird."

I pull her hand.

[Kiri]
"NO WAAAY!"

I pull her hips.

[Taichi]
"...I can see your panties yannow."
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Kiri]
"!?!"

Becoming panicked, she holds down her skirt.
//Still going nobread -GHS
Kiri's stance broke apart.
I pull and drag her in.

[Taichi]
"Congratulations on your debut as DJ!"
//Actively debating whether it should be "congralutaion". -GHS

[Kiri]
"HELP MEEEE!"

Not happening then?
Emancipated.
//Given that she's a slave'n all. -GHS
Kiri zoomed to behind Miki's back, concealing herself.
Damn that highly emotive small animal!

[Taichi]
"I get it... then I'll do it."

There wasn't anyone left but me.
//Touko's dead, of course, but Youko is conspicuously missing. Or is she? Look at the counts below... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Whenever's alright."
//HACK stop music here, zoom rooftop -GHS

What should I even talk about?
I can't think of anything.
The SOS is meaningless,
but no one would think that.
My body, feeling like a stranger's, moves on its own.
//~PILOTED BY JESAS~ seriously, an interesting automatism. If this is him being sincere, then... -GHS
The person who sits in the chair, taking the microphone,
is an automatic me.
I believe I have always been automatic.
The contacts I had with my surroundings have molded who I am now.
//Meaning he believes he can't surpass his upbringing. But he has already done so: he has demonstrated ability to talk to people in perfectly normal ways. What he can't surpass is his nature. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm... are there survivors listening to this broadcast?"
//After that last sex scene, that's a good question. -GHS
[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club."
//PCP (technically) CCA0030. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Are there people still living out there?"
[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club, we have eight survivors."
//...but the first words out of his mouth are a lie. Or is it? After all, Touko is not dead at all. Except Youko doesn't exist. But in his mind she's real. -GHS
[Taichi]
"We have eight survivors."
//Repeated means this is not a coincidence. -GHS

People should be important,
family and friends should be important,
as long as the self is a person.

[Taichi]
"...all members are in satisfactory health conditions."

If one is fine without being a person, then there does exist a way to live, called solitude.
But I'm glad to be a person.
I wanted to become a monster, not of instinct, but of rationality.
//Nietzscheian philosophy again. See CCD5001, Youko is one. -GHS
Because if I did, I would certainly have been able to become more perfectly harmless and domesticated, but,
I didn't have enough.
Of contact. Of reciprocal touching.
//Irrelevant, of course. There can NEVER be enough. That's not the reason he couldn't become a monster of rationality, that's the reason why doing so is absolutely impossible. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm..."
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

Family.
...don't have one.
In that miniature Garden of Eden, my relationships
were with people as thin as air itself.
//I still think this is a rejection of the incestuous undertones of Kana and Family Project. More importantly, he seems to assume the people of his youth aren't dead or gone... -GHS
...I seem to have even forgotten their faces.
//MEMORY HUNTER. -GHS
My meeting with Youko-chan.
...she doesn't see me as a separate person.
The people of the Shinkawas.
//BTW: a "new river" comes in, and drowns everything. -GHS
...I was made to learn that humans were the enemy.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
In early childhood, in that most delicate of times, I was never in contact with people.

[Taichi]
"Once upon a time, I committed a sin."

Tingle, the bells chimed.
//Not randomly. -GHS
Six pair of sights gather.
//HACK to antenna -GHS

[Taichi]
"I made a friend of mine... die."

[Sakuraba]
"...Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"My own hands were not what made it happen, but... the result is that I made him die."
[Taichi]
"That friend was, long ago, one of the humans who hurt me."
//The metaphor, as said in CCC3025, is that Shinkawa was Taichi's elementary school bully. The people of the Shinkawas taught him that Humans are the enemy, he had no contact with People, and Yutaka is a Human. The terms human/person aren't used anywhere near as consistently as I hoped, but here they flow together very well. -GHS
[Taichi]
"He then just appeared right in front of me, having lost his memory."
[Taichi]
"And he acted as if his sin had disappeared together with those memories."
//There it is, the single most important theme of the storyline. -GHS
[Taichi]
"At the beginning I did not realize either. Those were events of so many years before."

The mood changes.
The unease and the doubts of six humans swirl into an eddy.
//See CCC0000 (hey, bookends!), CCC0026, CCC3003. The insistence proves this isn't a typo: Youko is here... or is she? -GHS
It should settle down soon,
but it might perhaps end up as a bitter mood.

[Taichi]
"But once, on the spur of some moment, I recognized him."
[Taichi]
"Truth is, the pain I got from him should not have been that much of a big deal at all to me, as I am now."
//That is true. Combine with what he still told him. Just forgetting still isn't enough. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I, Kurosu Taichi, this unworthy reject I am, have my eyes set on the goal of becoming a young adult who is experienced in the ways of the world, having tasted its bitter and its sweet."
//Expanding -GHS
[Taichi]
"But."

Kiri stirred,
put her hand straight over her mouth.

[Taichi]
"But I... I attempted to see that person as a friend at all costs, but eventually I could not do so anymore."

[Kiri]
"...ngh..."

[Miki]
"Kiri...?"

[Taichi]
"I ended up seeing him like... a thing."
[Taichi]
"I think it was different from an emotional argument like 'I cannot forgive him', but,"
[Taichi]
"inside of me, the worth of that person changed completely, it certainly did."
[Taichi]
"No... changed is not the correct word... he became worthless to me."
[Taichi]
"My interest in him disappeared."
//Making him part of the Ignorables... -GHS
[Taichi]
"When the guy recovered his memories, he came and asked me to forgive him."
//...so it wasn't Taichi who pushed him into remembering? Not that Yutaka ever forgot. Unfortunately the specifics on this are contradictory, and given his "eight survivors" above, much of what he's saying here is not trustworthy. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Could it even be... that if he had not come to ask forgiveness, that the result would've been different? I do not know."
//It's also possible Taichi would've grown angrier and killed him, so that Yutaka's suicide prevented Taichi from having further blood on his hands. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!"

[Taichi]
"Whatever happens, the past is impossible to alter."
//This is a hint that the time loop simply must not exist for the story to make complete thematic sense. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Sin, I believe, is something you either just accept or respond to with hostility, nothing else."
//See CCB0018. Forgive or not, tertium non datur. He didn't forgive and here he admits it. Lines like this are where the contrast between Cross Channel's fundamental Christian nature and typical time travel stories show through best: with time travel, sin could be taken back. Not so here, and not just in the parts outside of time travel. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...his sin, itself, was... not much, not that big a deal at all."
//What actually happened at the Mansion is very much ambiguous, from what exactly was Taichi made to do to whether he actually killed everyone. Certainly what Youko did to him is far worse than what these people did, given how badly it broke him. The ambiguity is still the point here, whether Taichi actually thinks the sin was big or not, and whether the sin was actually big or not, are all intentional irrelevancies. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I wish I had just flowed into some joke like always, and just kept being a friend to him."

[Kiri]
"...Sen... pai..."

Tears.
Tears?
Those are something that I, myself, do not have.
//This starts around here: Taichi keeps talking as if he didn't have tears period, but he was seen tearing up repeatedly in the past, in ways not necessarily dishonest. These tears he lacks are the ones for Yutaka. And this moment, Kiri and Taichi are, in a sense, halves; but unfortunately, she can't cry for him. This route is still a failure. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Why didn't I just tell him, at that time, something like, don't worry about it... that is something I have thought about often myself."
[Taichi]
"...it is because I am... warped."
[Taichi]
"Because I have a warped heart and a distorted mind."
[Taichi]
"I do not have enough rationality."
[Taichi]
"But for the sake of fostering one's rationality, others are a necessity."
[Taichi]
"Without reciprocal conflict, I do not think it is possible to be raised properly."
//I still disagree with this, but this is about analysis, not picking at philosophical nits. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But I hurt and made go away a friend I had for this reciprocal conflict."
//He could very well mean what happened at the Mansion... or at any time. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...that... is my dilemma."
//This is a bit sloppy. The dilemma would be that he needs other people, but he can't hang around them well enough; written like this it sounds like he needed Yutaka and killed him instead, which isn't a dilemma. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Recollections can go away, but what happened in the past does not disappear."
//Further cementing that the loop is just the effect of time on memory, not an actual reset. -GHS
[Taichi]
"But being hurt, and hurting someone..."
[Taichi]
"...it has to be between two people who are opposite but equal to each other."
//The difference between Taichi/Tomoki and Taichi/Yutaka, or Tomoki/Taichi and Tomoki/Misato. Also see CCC3022: this is the meaning of that "living opposite of you", and why Taichi can't do it. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ngh... sob..."

A fit of crying.

[Misato]
"...Sakura-san."

All the ones here must have realized by now,
that this is about me and Yutaka.
No one calls to me,
no one tries to stop me.

[Taichi]
"...I had become horrifying."
[Taichi]
"But I could not kill myself. That is self-determination!"
//自決 "self-determination" is used in the blatant concept, but also literally means suicide. For a pseudo-Nietzscheian like Taichi, it's definitely an odd term to bring up, especially if he meant it just as a flat synonym. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And I also had this thought that it would have been better of there were no other people."
//Screeeam it at the reader, screeeam it, they won't listeeen. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Every time there was hurting, I thought that."
//From as well as to him. -GHS
[Taichi]
"One week has passed... since the moment people have vanished from this world."
[Taichi]
"And I have thought, too, that it could have all been my fault somehow."
//This is another random thought that becomes fossilized as the Settei marches on. -GHS

[Misato]
"..."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Because I'm just a good-for-nothing, I am."
//It's almost time for him to pilot a giant robot with the soul of his mother against--- you know what let's not give this any ideas. This is also what Touko believes, see CCB2016. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And that is the kind of person I am, I haven't but never given something that could be called gratitude to all the people who are always around me."

[Sakuraba]
"Which is it?"

A rare straight-man from Sakuraba.

[Tomoki]
"Multiple negatives."

A mechanical straight-man from Tomoki.

[Taichi]
"...I'm fine with doing things for myself."
[Taichi]
"I don't have a problem with cherishing people for the sake of my self."
[Taichi]
"For the sake... of becoming just a little better the next day."
//And given the week is a day... -GHS
[Taichi]
"I still have true companions."
[Taichi]
"Building oneself up also means filling one's heart with wounds."
[Taichi]
"It is something merely painful, with no beauty to it."
[Taichi]
"But for a person, I thought, people are necessary."
[Taichi]
"That is why I believe there are still living people listening to this broadcast, somewhere."
[Taichi]
"Our address is---"
//What's even the point? As long as they know it's inner Kamisaka... -GHS

I also announce the procedure to contact us via radio.
//We can go without a proclaim here. -GHS
And this is all.
I've talked until I was empty, have I.
...well, that's how it is.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club, we have eight survivors."
[Taichi]
"Are there people still living out there?"
[Taichi]
"See you next week."
//Nanaka to the last. -GHS

Finished.
//Technically it'd be a PCP CCA0016 and CCA0027, but... -GHS
I take a rest with a sigh.
//HACK keep the zoom -GHS
Applause.
First was Mimi-senpai. Then everybody follows.
//See final week. Or this one. Same thing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

I couldn't bring myself to make fun of things.
I am engulfed by embarrassment.
I scratched my cheek to bear this sweet torture.

[Misato]
"Good, very well done!"

[Taichi]
"...huh."
//HACK Tomoki doll immediately... this looked so wrong. Tweaked the positions, as they're a bit too far to the right. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Next week, you said?"
//Also literally "next week, seven days?" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, well... seemed appropriate."

[Tomoki]
"You sure it was right? All those details, I mean."

[Sakuraba]
"...don't they."

[Miki]
"You look'd so awesooome!"
//Intentional'd -GHS

Click after click she was taking pictures with a disposable camera.
//Pictures that likely end up in the wall on "onee-chan"'s room, except they shouldn't survive the loop. And there's not a shred of doubt she's not reset here. How odd. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...c'mon stop iiit."

[Miki]
"Embarrassed! Embarrassed!"

[Taichi]
"Shaaaddeeeep!"

And then,

[Kiri]
"...Senpai."

Kiri stood.
What will she even say?
I wait, tense.

[Kiri]
"Go."

Go.

[Kiri]
"Good... job out there."

A bow of the head.
//TWU WUV (read in 4bit audio sampling please) -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

A burst of strong feelings and deep emotions,
that I cannot make into words.
Something incomprehensible, yet at the same time a relief, a feeling like that.
There's the feeling that the level of the water in my heart is rising,
//See CCC3015. But also see CCC3012A: is this necessarily a good thing...? -GHS
an extremely small amount.

[Taichi]
"...thank ye."

The sky flashed white for an instant.

[Taichi]
"...!"

Awww, it's gotta have this timing---
I quickly become terrified,
but I cannot afford to lose composure.
//HACK out with the doll. -GHS
I hug Kiri.
I fall to my knees, and bury my head in her belly.

[Kiri]
"Kyah, wh-, what do you think you're doing?!"

[Miki]
"Whoa, that's so bold..."

[Misato]
"I-, illicit sexual suspensionship..."
//A play on 不純異性交遊 (illicit sexual relationship) -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"That's a neologism, President-senpai."

[Tomoki]
"...Taichi's really a perv innhe."

[Taichi]
"I'm just exhausteeed! I'm being comforteeed!"

Frightening.
That I will no longer be is frightening.
Last save point was Saturday night.
//See CCC3013. There'll be nothing here he can reflect on, then. -GHS
Today's happiness and repentance and the small amount of growth in the heart, too, will all be to waste.
I'm scared, scared, scared.

[Kiri]
"...Senpai... you're crying?"
//For himself, still not for Yutaka. -GHS

[Miki]
"......Kiri-chin."
//HACK new line. It's sorta pointless, but it's a reminder of something very wrong with this sequence of events: Miki, despite being blatantly unreset, is still on the rooftop as the reset comes. Her last line wasn't long ago, but this is now the last spoken line before the reset comes. She either doesn't know about the reset, or no reset is coming. Notice that, like Week 1, no one seems to be worried by the sudden evening or the sequence of events in the absolute slightest. -GHS

Buzzing in the ears.
//HACK recycling the blends -GHS
Near the edge of my eyes buried in the chest, the world was growing bright.
//HACK Blend 2 -GHS
Growing bright---
//HACK Blend 3 -GHS

[Taichi]
"...fuck me."
//HACK and now pure white. -GHS

Those ended up being the last words before my end.
