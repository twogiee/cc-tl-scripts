And then to club.
//HACK and still. -GHS
Thanks to Tomoki having done the wiring, I pitch a tent, take out a long table and lay out the equipment on.
//fnarr, fnarr. More interestingly, see CCC3018. They have a tent in house now. Maybe it's the very same tent as the one they picked up there... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Next is the antenna, then."

There still are problem spots left on the blueprint.
They might just not influence the broadcast, maybe, but,
because this is club, I should just follow the plan exactly.
Working.
A presence.
//HACK to sky -GHS
I pass my gaze on the surroundings.
There is no one.
Is this just my imagination... it isn't, is it.
And with that, this place is now dangerous. It's high up.
Standing still on top of the stepladder is not good either.
Regardless of potential range, her effective range is around 20 meters.
//HACK back -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right when this thing needed one last effort, too..."

And just then Senpai came.
//HACK more worried Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"I am so much a sleepyheaaaã€œd."

[Taichi]
"Your lifestyle is steadily getting rougher, it seems."
//HACK less worried Misato. -GHS

[Misato]
"...hahahah. I have no words for that."
[Misato]
"Truly, this is already all done is it..."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"
//HACK surprised Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, a tent."

[Taichi]
"The wiring is also finished."
//HACK no need -GHS

[Misato]
"Y-, you jest, you did it?"

[Taichi]
"Yes, for your sake, Senpai..."

[Misato]
"That is amazing! You managed to reach all the itchy places I could not scratch! Peke-kun, your level of Amazing is now---"
//See CCA0029. Wow, Prezy Kissy actually does happen! -GHS

[Taichi]
"...is what I wanted to say, but Tomoki did it."

[Misato]
"..."

At first she was disgusted,
//HACK actually surprised Misato, instead of pissed off. -GHS
then surprised. How conscientious.
//HACK no change -GHS

[Misato]
"Has Tomoki been helping us?"

[Taichi]
"It would be more correct to say that he was made to help, yes."
//HACK sad Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes... but... he is still helping us, he is..."
//HACK standard Misato instead ofAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGH!!!!!! Which was my reaction when a bug makes Tomoki suddenly appear, and not on the PC window (bugs there I expect) but on the PS2 emulator. This was fixed in the 360 version (that's how I know which doll goes here). -GHS

Relief becomes visible.

[Taichi]
"So glad he is."

[Misato]
"...yes!"

[Taichi]
"By the way Senpai, my bowels feel a bit loose... could you relieve me, please?"
//fnarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes. If things have gotten done this far, it seems like I will be fine alone."

[Taichi]
"On that thing at the top, the screw got stripped so I believe it would be best to replace it."

[Misato]
"Understood!"

[Taichi]
"...then, I shall go have a bit of a struggle."

[Misato]
"Fight ooon!"
//HACK out with the doll. -GHS

Responding to the encouragement with one hand, I entered inside the school building.
So,
you want to show me the results of all your practice, don't you?
