Touko was in the classroom.
//Still ARAIBU DE GOZAIMASU NANO DE ARfuck I need to up my dosage of anti-weeaboo pills again. -GHS
Bent over the desk, sleeping.
//staff 杖=つえ tsue, desk 机=つくえ tsukue, typo fixed in the console version. -GHS
Been sitting here all along, perhaps.
She doesn't have the escape into club that Mimi-senpai and Tomoki have,
nor days of relief like I,
//I take it this is "plugging his USB dongle into its cap", if you know what I mean, and if you do, please don't tell me. -GHS
not even the impregnable fortress of an ego like Youko-chan.
Touko might have nowhere to escape to, perhaps.
//See CCB2010 -GHS
This is... just like before.
In the world that was before the fall of mankind,
Touko was also alone.
A life of endlessly pretending to be brave.
That's why she was brittle, once she became frayed.
I draw near and call out.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Tooouko."

[Touko]
"...nnngh."

Stirring,
yet not waking.

[Taichi]
"Wanna eat sandwiches?"

[Touko]
"...but I have... no appetite."

Her breathing quickly returned to a sleeper's.
//Hmmm, see CCC0031C. My Touko In The Infirmary theory is far from proven, I know, but this is a near-perfect parallel with Sakuraba regardless. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right."

Somewhat emaciated.
This lady... is she even eating properly.
I take some sweets out of my pocket and let them roll out onto the desk.
