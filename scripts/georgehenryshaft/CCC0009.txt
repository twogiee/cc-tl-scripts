...should I drop by, then?

[Taichi]
"Mngh."

Thirst for blood.
It clings to the entrance of the store.
I peep inside.
Friend or foe?

[Taichi]
"...yama?" (mountain)

[Miki]
"...kawa." (river)
//YAMAnobe shinKAWA. These terms are obviously unimportant. -GHSarcasmBeatsBoredomIfNotMuch
[Miki]
"Throughout Heaven and Earth?"

[Taichi]
"Body odor stands alone."
//Doesn't seem to be a reference, just a twist on a relatively common phrase. Most common seems to be 天上天下唯我独尊, roughly translatable as "I alone am sacred throughout the Heavens and Earth", which certainly applies to Miki (or at least, it should). -GHS

[Miki]
"...come in."

I enter inside the shop.

[Taichi]
"Miki then... who did you think it was."

[Miki]
"Good morning, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Because, you've been emitting what seems like thirst for blood."

[Miki]
"If there's something in a sealed space, isn't it bad not to have a place to escape to?"
//Not just the shop, but also Kamisaka... and possibly the parallel world (for trollZ). Then again, her hiding place may be Taichi's chuuni. By the way, since she robs Tasaki and writes down vegetable juice, it's extremely appropriate she'd meet Taichi here. She's about to steal his chuuni and write down 'parallel universe'. But it'll be the way to save him, in a sense. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Extremely so."

My thoughts run to old memories.
//So what was his hiding place in the Hasekura mansion? Youko seems a definite possibility, regardless of her existence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're wearing the uniform, you wanna go to school then?"

[Miki]
"Indeed. There's nothing else to do after all."

[Taichi]
"You too?"

[Miki]
"Seems so."

What simple-minded innocence we had.

[Taichi]
"A drink for me, too."

[Miki]
"Something like this!"

[Taichi]
"As always a Drink Choice of high rarity, thank you."
//Wanted pun (raritea), but it's not tea. :-( -GHS

Those in the know know it well, it was Nee**n.
//See CCC3003. Annoyingly, it's a different censoring. -GHS
Chug it! One gulp!
//Not an actual slogan for Neepon (or anything) that I can find. -GHS

[Miki]
"Best drunk before looking at the expiration date."
//The joke seems to be, given CCC3003, that the guy doesn't procure Showa Era beverages, i.e. beverages that got famous during Showa; he procures beverages that were literally produced during Showa. -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'blagh!"

It had entered the trachea.
//I have it that humans die when that happens, but I demand scientific evidence and the license to experimentally review it. Many many times. -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'khoff, g'khaff!"
//Do note that he's spitting it out in response to her line, he never says the drink tastes obviously spoiled... maybe she just got a minor vendetta against the Tasaki store owner and his damnable Christianity. -GHS

[Miki]
"Smash hit!"

And posing.
//Unsure of the reference if any. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...don't read-icule people!"
//Seems to mean "to outsmart". Read (anticipate) + ridicule seems to work. -GHS

[Miki]
"Sorryyy."

She drenches herself with a flippant smirk.
//Seems to be ニヤニヤ+ヘラヘラ http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1243010082 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tch, this oboko here!"
//See CCA0003. Curiously, I'm seeing ケッ as 'autograph collection'... but I can't really source it. -GHS

I spat her way.
//See CCA0007 et al. Been a while. -GHS

[Miki]
"I think I'll want to discard that before I turn twenty."
//Implying she's been through less than 261 loops. 108 looks nice, in fact: she'd be just around legal. The loli is older than the rest of the cast, and there's your superficial antithesis.　Also, she knows what an oboko is, unlike Nanaka. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't become twenty years old in the first place!"

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Live like now for all eternity."
//SOMEONE has a Peter Pan syndrome. -GHS

[Miki]
"...I feel like I could, but that's impossible."
//Translator's note that explains this. -GHSoMetaWoooh

Isn't it now.
No, wait, more importantly,

[Taichi]
"So, who're you giving it to?"

[Miki]
"...eh? Hummm... Falcon Katou."
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%A0%E8%97%A4%E9%B7%B9 -GHS

[Taichi]
"So much emphasis on the technique!"

I sighed.
Ain't he Japan's foremost Technician now.
...I'd never beat him.

[Taichi]
"I may not be at the levels of Falcon, but I have quite confidence in my techniques, indeed."

[Miki]
"Senpai, your techniques are exclusively for sexual harassment, so whether they are of use in principal photography is an aspect I am significantly uncertain about, and therefore, my deepest and most sincere apologies, but it ain't happening."
//Running gag works even here as Miki likes to take pictures. -GHS

She's so warrior-like when she ends all that on something that casual.
//Original sentence sounds hyperformal but ends on an informal verb conjugation, which by rules of the language means the entire sentence is paradoxically informal. -GHS
That style of rejection just makes my heart more and more Broken.

[Taichi]
"Tch, you say all that, but the truth is that you will offer it to Kiri-chin, won't you? You debauched virgin...!"

[Miki]
"More like I'll be snatching Kiri-chin's virginity away."
//This is endfully amusing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awww, I wanna join in to that!"
//See CCA0015. And remember that Miki's seen that. -GHS

The desires that are multiplexing in me raise my Fad Chaser levels to 82%.
//Vs. want. 3181 in kanji: 三一八一. -GHS

[Miki]
"And with that, let's go to school togetheeer!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, let's go."

The two of us go to school with linked hands.

[Taichi]
"Oh, under this blue sky〜♪"

[Miki]
"How well together we go〜♪"
//Sooo wanna change this with lyrics from the Family Project theme song... some other time. -GHS

A carefree duet while we leisurely went to school.

[Miki]
"......"
[Miki]
"Ah, silly me. I totally forgot about Kirichy's drink."
//Lit. "Kirichii". -GHS

We had come all the way to school when she said that.

[Taichi]
"Damnable fool. Your discipline is inadequate!"

[Miki]
"Going back."

[Taichi]
"Go up and down those slopes as much as you like!"
//Assuming sexual undertones. It's what I always do anyway. -GHS

[Miki]
"Heeey!"

A nimble gallop.
Gay gal.
//Old meaning. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
//...I can't believe I held back laughing until now. Snooort "old meaning". -GHS
