I often met with Yusa-chan on this road.
She took to me well.
She was this ticklish being...
I too went through so much hardship to become what I am now,
and the presence of Yusa-chan soothed me so much.
That girl is also no more.

[Sakuraba]
"Yo."
//Yusa is no more and is replaced with Sakuraba and his hexagons. Hmmm. -GHS

It was Sakuraba.

[Taichi]
"Yoh."

[Sakuraba]
"Hungry."

[Taichi]
"Haven't eaten then?"

[Sakuraba]
"Readying for first period class."

[Taichi]
"...is the subject curry bread perhaps?"
//See CCB2009, CCX0001. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Until that day when curry bread itself has finally passed."
//See CCD5001, CCX0001, T1. Curry is Christianity; unlike the sky, it will never pass. That's why there's always curry bread left over in the cafeteria. Yeah, I wish I were kidding, but the reason no one likes it there is that, metaphorically, few Japanese are Christians. -GHS

So Sakuraba resolved, all cool.

[Taichi]
"Wouldn't you like to eat some retort pouch curry too?"

[Sakuraba]
"I hate curry."
//This is actually Sakuraba's problem; he likes curry only as long as it's stuffed in a thick lengthy loaf that he likes to offer to Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

An enigma... at the very least, this guy, really...
//In the end, Taichi will have to still guide him out of the Valley... or he'd just get lost, since he doesn't quite get this all himself, nor does he need to. -GHS
What'd he even intentionally come here for?
It's very unlikely that with his Conformity Coefficient he'd just snap.
//He's on a Mission from God. -GHS
I knew it, it's just the pressure of his parents' assets...

[Taichi]
"Meaningleeess."

[Sakuraba]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"I was just enlightened as to the meaninglessness of your presence right now."
//Yusa->Sakuraba->Sakuraba's useless (of course not, he's among the most important characters). -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"What... don't you know my old man said I am the world itself?
//Well, Tanaka does imply he is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your old man is way too tepid with you!"

[Sakuraba]
"The way you put that is inexplicable..."
//Hum, "your father should've told you to go to hell"? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Combat not being around is to be mourned."
//He might just not be around now. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hu... thanks to that I can go to school all carefree."
//Hu laugh. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Go get yourself more hardships. Money's your strong point, so buy some hardships with it. And then with all those hardships you can get a lot more damaged!"

[Sakuraba]
"Ordering difficulties."
//Seems to be the joke. -GHS

A careful and attentive school commute with Sakuraba.
//No, seriously. -GHS
And,

[Sakuraba]
"Heh-cks!"

[Taichi]
"Hexagon?!"
//Full of hearts. Told you sneezes were important too. Yusa is replaced by Sakuraba, ergo this is the reading key to go look at her sneeze in CCA0013 again. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Sniff... summer cold?"

It was a sneeze.

[Sakuraba]
"Mnuh!"

It was a tiny exclamation of surprise caused by the subject of Sakuraba's fixed gaze.
The gap between me and Sakuraba was spanned by a bridge.
One side was on my uniform, in the precise middle of my abdomen,
The other side was on Sack's nose.
In short,

[Sakuraba]
"Hu...!"

He laughs invincibly.
//Same as the Friendship Demands. -GHS
it was a snot bridge.
//This connects two lines above now. -GHS
This high-viscosity fluid had, with a
-streeeeiaaatch-
dangled a suspension bridge between us.
This is my inference.
On the very downbeat of the sneeze, the launched glob of mucus fired onto to my uniform with a nuzzle velocity superior to even that of the Shinkansen (no, seriously).
This mightily adhesive fluid was drawn by the fired bullet and dragged from Sakuraba's nasal cavity, and this connection that normally would break had a viscosity strongly reminiscent of the stubbornness of the head of a house that made it hold, thus completing the bridge.
//See CCA0002. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"......"

And it seems that, at last, this guy has also understood the event.
His face fills with a feeling of refreshness.
He does not make one movement.
Perhaps, right now, this guy's thinking, oh how refreshing my nose feels after a discharge of mucus... and all things of that sort. Do bet on it.

[Taichi]
"Hey... Dung-headed Cumnose."
//Still see CCA00013. Also, this is the most obvious representation of Taichi's true ultramarine, which has nothing to do with murder. -GHS

I bestowed him with a title full of infantile spirit.

[Sakuraba]
"Hnha?"

I wouldn't know if it's because of the extreme mental strain,
but Sakuraba looked really satisfied.
Why you...!
Not planting new psychological traumas in this brat is out of the question.
I must make this guy even just a little closer to a proper ultramarine of Gunjou.
The blood of the Empire of Atlantis was boiling.
//IOW ultramarines are for the emper-GHS
Faster than the Sakuraba could react, I calmly produce a handkerchief.
//Interesting change, isn't it. -GHS
With it I first cover Sakuraba's nose.

[Sakuraba]
"...nmyu?"

He makes a fucking creepy moe voice.
//Sometimes ya just gotta drop 'em. -GHS
I tear apart the root then, alternating the clean spots on the hanky, wipe the subnasal so many times.
After that comes the collection of the snot bridge while very carefully wiping down my own uniform.
I return the hanky to pocket... not, and press it into Sakuraba's face.

[Sakuraba]
"ooooOOOOOOOO?!"
//9???? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Sakuraba]
"That's... just a bit... filthy... isn't it?"

[Taichi]
"It's fine."

So I say with a bright smile.

[Taichi]
"It's you after all."

Grind grind I push it on him.

[Sakuraba]
"oUUoUUoUUoUU."
//???????????????????????? total = 12 -GHS

Grind grind grind grind.

[Sakuraba]
"oUUoUUoUUoUU."
//???????????????????????? and wait until CCD5001! -GHS

It was the depiction of a scene of Hell.
//Ah, wait, OUx8 + GRINDx6 = 14 = 7x2 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Leaving the most adorable Greatness That Is I crying himself to sleep is not worth a handkerchief."

So I proclaim in a dusky tone of voice.

[Sakuraba]
"...nnn!"

Sakuraba's body shook as if tipsy.
//微醺... if only because the next sentence would then imply he's drunk on snot. -GHS
The tactile feeling of mucus likely shorted out his mind.
With the handkerchief still stuck to him he falls down on the ground.

[Taichi]
"Indulge in hexagons if you want, but you'd better watch out for summer colds, Sakuraba-kun."

Stomp, and after trampling over his head I begin to walk.
//Mystery of CCA0027 solved? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Seriously."

[Sakuraba]
"Once more I managed to make a memory with you."

He walks next to me, calmly.
//As if absolutely nothing of the above had happened at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"At least take a bit of damage!!!"
//Besides the reading key that puts in doubt whether Yusa really rejected Taichi, there's another important thing: when Yusa, the cute girl, does something, Taichi's all velvet gloves; when Sakuraba, the annoying ass, does the same thing, Taichi's pissed. This is a hint that Taichi's being a hypocrite by hating Yutaka but tolerating Sakuraba, both of which did functionally equivalent things to him. -GHS

A single handkerchief and I made Sakuraba's friendship all mine, dammit.
