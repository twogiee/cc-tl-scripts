And with all that, here I am in the midst of club activities.
Where should I put this part now?
Here?
Or perhaps here?

[Taichi]
"..."

How about I set it down here. It sort of feels kinda right.

[Misato]
"Do you get how to do iiit?"
//Shouty -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeeeah, sorta."

Below me, Senpai is holding the stepladder firm.
//I wonder why they don't switch--- oh, right, panties. I don't understand why they don't switch. -GHS

[Misato]
"It is so reliable to have a boy heeere!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed, my lord!"
//Going with literal 'tomo' just for the below. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Any moment is auspicious to order your worthless servant..."

Hold on,
doesn't this person here have a younger brother?

[Taichi]
"...uhm, are you fighting with Tomoki?"

Senpai's face instantly clouds.

[Misato]
"Ahhh, well..."
[Misato]
"It is sort of a cold war."

[Taichi]
"Tomoki seems to be in a bit of a fight with you too, ya know."
//Less formal here. -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"It's just, it's rare that guy gets seriously angry."
//He still doesn't get Tomoki's hypocrisy. -GHS

Senpai seemed to be shocked at those words.

[Misato]
"...it may just be obvious, of course."
//These fragments don't quite fit together. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"It is that, 'life is hard, darn it all' feeling."
//Doesn't sound too Tomokish, and Audio is very split in two sentences. -GHS

I'm not getting this.
//HACK big Tomoki superimposed -GHS

[Tomoki]
『...you'll be betrayed.』
//HACK big Tomoki out -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, is it this thing about 'betrayal'?"

The gap between her eyebrows grew tighter.

[Misato]
"Was it Tomoki who said that?

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

[Misato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Senpai?"

[Misato]
"...nnngh... nnno..."
//It's both a groan and a 'no'... -GHS

Senpai growled this no-like 'ngggh' with a tearful face.
//...split the difference. -GHS

[Taichi]
"H-e-l-l-o?"

[Misato]
"What do you think that is even called, really!"

She rocks the stepladder, clattering.
//WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE, KEICHIIII? WHY DID *SHE* SURVIVE AND SATOSHI HAD TO DIEEEE!!!!! Watanagashi-hen was released not 5 months after CC, and that scene seems to sort of be useless in retrospect... -GHS

[Taichi]
"WahWahWah?!"

[Misato]
"You cannot do that!!!"

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna faaall!!!"

These were miserable club activities.
