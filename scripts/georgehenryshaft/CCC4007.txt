[Miki]
"Uwoooh, when you move it the tingle tingle spreads arouuund!"
//Hmmm, see CCA0009B -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bear with it, I'm going to summon a famed physician now."

I opened the window and whistled.
//HACK SFX -GHS
C'mere! Youko!
//Doesn't gel with below, so no furrys for the now -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

She doesn't come.
//Interesting how he expects her to be outside, but still within instantaneous walking distance of a room deep inside the school. Shouldn't he be calling from inside the corridor? Of course, this works better if she doesn't exist... -GHS
Once again, I whistle.
//HACK SFX -GHS
COME HERE! YOUKO!

[Taichi]
"............"

Well now.
//Sorta girly. -GHS

[Miki]
"This arm of mine is trrremendously torn open."
//すんごく seems just a cutesy/odd way of saying it, not a dialect. -GHS

[Taichi]
"AhWahWah!"
//Quite girly. -GHS

No avoiding this, then, I'll just have to just administer aid myself won't I.
I roll up her sleeve,
to see the area where the mouth of the cut is.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

The odor of blood is harsh as I expected.
//Odor. Staring right at it? No problem! -GHS
I pinch down my nose with a clothespin.
//Where'd he find that in an infirmary? Wait, I don't want to know. See CCB2002 - Touko. Ah, but there's one big problem now: he's got no problem SWALLING the odor of blood. Shouldn't that be, you know, even worse? -GHS

[Miki]
"What's that?"

[Taichi]
"Dish bill be bine (this will be fine)."

[Miki]
"...don't tell me that's part of the medical treatment?"

I let her draw whatever conclusion she liked.
//See CCB0008B. Although she should know it won't be, this is still Miki getting carried away a little too easily... -GHS
Uhmmm... first, water...
I was away the blood with the water in the rinse basin.
//Which was there. Somehow. Left behind despite humanity being gone. Like it was in the toilets, and home, and more. More and more credible, isn't it. -GHS
Relieved sigh.

[Miki]
"............"

Miki was staring at me, fixed, as if conjecturing about me.
//Regarding Youko's death, which she almost certainly knows about already. -GHS
Disinfectant...

[Miki]
"Mgh'yaaah!"
//right? -GHS

Looks like it permeated.
Once moah'.
//HACK hurts!!! -GHS

[Miki]
"Hgh'yaaah!"
//clover????? -GHS

Like this I guess.
Gauze.
Dressing.
Dressing's crap.
//See CCA0017A -GHS
I roll down the sleeve.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

I don't need the clothespin anymore.

[Taichi]
"Surgery completed."
//HACK sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"...I'm still tingly, and I feel numb around the cut."

[Taichi]
"That's the love."
//HACK See? Totally taking this too seriously. -GHS

[Miki]
"Th-, this is love."

[Taichi]
"Furthermore, it's Twue Wuv. Favorability rating at 89%. No mistake about it."
//Seems to be the "love meter". 89->17->8, so of course it's a load. -GHS

[Miki]
"So it is. This is love..."

[Taichi]
"How does it feel for your love to bloom?"
//SMOOTH. -GHS

[Miki]
"...I don't get it. I have never fallen in love not once in my life."

[Taichi]
"Sob, you're making me cry."

[Miki]
"Or, should I say, sorry for having you give me medical assistance when blood is your weak spot, Senpai."
//No "how does she know"... then again, he never questioned her using Mimi-senpai not once. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What for. There's no doctors anymore, injuries are a very big deal. We gotta take care of ourselves."

[Miki]
"Take care of ourselves... very much so..."
//See route ending. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It'll go fine."
//HACK happy Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"I still feel I must give some as an expression of gratitude."

[Taichi]
"If you would give me one pair of underwear, then."

[Miki]
"...whoooa, steeep..."

[Taichi]
"Just kidding. Kiri-chin'd kill me."

[Miki]
"Any other desired articles?

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, the first kiss I already got, didn't I..."

[Miki]
"Guh, indeed you have..."

Miki-Miki got shocked.

[Taichi]
"Though you got memories!"

[Miki]
"Whether I like it or not, I will have to live with this memory with me I will..."
[Miki]
"Is there nothing outside the sexual?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm... a date..."

Inspiration.

[Taichi]
"Double date!"

[Miki]
"Eh, in what combination?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, me, and Miki, and Kiri-chin."

[Miki]
"Isn't that a double only in women?"
//Well, she accumulated enough Princess Stamps for a Triple by this point. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, please count me as two."
//二人締め? Seems to be Osakan. And of course she can count him as two, though his other is still another "girl". I know Youko is Taichisexual, and also Taichi in drag, but can we have those Kiri/Youko fanfics already? -GHStillHereToHelp

[Miki]
"Well, if you want me to."

[Taichi]
"It's OK then?"

[Miki]
"It is!"

A flower in both hands then.

[Miki]
"...if I was alone I'd just feel all like, ohhh what do I do, but if Kiri-chin comes with it'll be all okieh!"

[Taichi]
"You seem to be vigilant."

[Miki]
"I aaam!"
[Miki]
"Because Senpai is sooo dangerous!"

[Taichi]
"Hahahahahah!"

However, Miki doesn't know,
how I am, in fact, dangerous.
//Poor boy's about to be totally pwnt3r3@d (sp). -GHS
Urges.
They stir, sometimes.
And those are what I struggle against.
//His "INTERNAL DEMaNS" are just another part of his chuuni setting. (Except for the one(s) that aren't.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Got lots and lots of stuff to be grateful for to you, Mikicchi."

[Miki]
"?"

[Taichi]
"You also saved me on Monday... thanks, lots."

[Miki]
"...mh, well... that wasn't really..."

[Taichi]
"The way you moved to save Kiri-chin that was sooo awesome. I totally thought you were someone else!"
//See CCA0027 (almost forgot!) -GHS
[Taichi]
"Seriously..."

She had agility at a level beyond recognition.
But I wonder, was Miki always that keen?
And she had dragged me, moved me all the way to my home, right?
Does she even have that kind of strength?

[Taichi]
"Your kicks were also sharp... now that I recall..."

I ponder, deeply.
Something is worrying me very much.

[Miki]
"Ah, uhmmm!"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"
//HACK IN YOUR FACE -GHS

[Miki]
"...pchk!"
//Sexual distractions. Of course she can have learned that herself, but that Nanaka is still the major source of them so far ought be suspicious. -GHS

On the cheek.
Outside of Youko-chan, this was the first time this happened to me.
//HACK fade the doll, correct position. -GHS

[Miki]
"Advance payment on gratitude!"

[Taichi]
"I-, I-, I am giving you the chaaange!"

I leap onto Miki.
//HACK independent CG shake. -GHS
This turns everything sepia. Very interesting, given zubaaan is not supposed to happen. -GHS
