[Taichi]
"QuickQuickQuickQuick!"
//Monday September 7, 1998 -GHS

I flew out of the house with vigorous swiftness.
The result of this storage of power while on standby inside of the door is an uppermost elevation in the most highest of styles.
//Beautiful quasi-nonsense (it's about his till-now gloomy mood that he's faking out as cheerful). Last part may well be "I have a hard-on". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hiii hellooo!"

If it was as always, this'd be a shameful playact.
Salarymen midway through commute,
students with snappy style,
great-great-granddaughter gyaru in a group going to (pre)school.
//玄孫ギャル seems to be コギャル with waaay younger girls. See CCB2012 for why I left it. -GHS
Even though the lukewarm sights of this assembly of people would gently surround me.
//Intended to be read as him doing the playact despite the sights above. -GHS
There is no one.
//...but that's only for readers who aren't paying any attention. He all but said there's everyone AND no one simultaneously. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...sigh."

Nope, doesn't look like it was a dream.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

Naaah.
Still not the time to surrender to this sight.
That is what you are.
//Intended to be read both as him laughing at the joke and him forcing himself to laugh. See rest of the script (and CCB0005) for more evidence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Pffft!"
//See CCA0029 -GHS

I hold down the mouth.
Mankind had fallen!

[Taichi]
"Mpffffft, pfffft!"

A disaster of laughter.
//Forcing himself to laugh + suppressing a laugh + laughing out loud. -GHS
These days, the Fall of Mankind is beneath stories and jokes alike.
Is it not the 21st Century?
//No, but he might be playing the kyuppachi game anyway. -GHS
This is most exceedingly hackneyed!
//These two formal. -GHS
The Unsinkable Battleship Japan may sink, but the islands shall never sink!
//Doesn't seem to be a reference to an actual militaristic propaganda discourse. This uses the "island chain" kanji to identify Japan, as with CCA0007. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That aside."

After that bout of laughter, I rapidly collected myself.
//He doesn't, look at below as he flies into panic nearly worthy of CCX0001. Actions matter, not words. -GHS
When surrounded by an absence of people, making uproar is only futility.

[Taichi]
"Right, let's go meet up with Yusa-chan."
//He ignores his conclusions and goes right into a panic. -GHS

Without the sight of that Ultra Pretty Little Girl who nearby dwells, the day has not begun.
I visit Doujima residence. It's close.

[Taichi]
"Yusa-chaaan, hellooo!"

I knock, but there's no reply.

[Taichi]
"Are you insiiide?"

Right, the intercom.
It's an intercom with a TV camera built in for security.
//What an odd thing to have in what should be one of the safest neighborhoods in one of the safest countries in the world. -GHS
Push,
no sound.

[Taichi]
"...ah, right then."

Because the power supply had been interrupted.
//Not because you can't hear it from outside of the house. -GHS
TV, same.
Phone lines, same.
No vacuuming, no refrigerating.
Nothing of nothing.
I slam on the door.

[Taichi]
"Mother-in-laaaw?"
[Taichi]
"Yusa-yusaaa!"
//They've both gone on ahead, likely. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I have come to help myself to Ojou-saaan!"
[Taichi]
"Mooo-ther..."
[Taichi]
Yu...sa..."

The fist I slam in, but there is only fraying and falling.
//Him and the punches. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then."
//HACK fade into a completely new never seen before BG. -GHS

I go to Yoshida-san's house.

[Taichi]
"Awoof!"

The ferocious wild dog Combat should have been there,
however.

[Taichi]
"..."

The dog house was a shed skin.
//And not a mention of the collar and the chain that he would've left behind if he had been Taken, rather than if he had simply uprooted it and left. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Even dogs?"

Now that I say it, I did not see even just one cat.

[Taichi]
"Yeeeah, yeeeah."
[Taichi]
"A dream with great consistency, innit."

If it's a dream then no need for concern, it's a dream.

[Taichi]
"Should I go to school, then."

A commute to school after a month and a half.
On looking upwards, the weather's nice.
The weather for a school commute.
For a pleasant business commute.
My white bangs hung hazily in front of my eyelids, and filtered the sunlight.

[Taichi]
"Awww, and I wanted to cut 'em..."

How gloomy.
I don't really like my hair, although it's a bit the color's fault.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

As I played with my bangs I began on the hill-infested road to school, common nickname: The Hills to School.
Trudging along.
And that instant,

[Nanaka]
"Kyaaaaaaaaaah?!"

What the?!
Thump!
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Nanaka]
"KyaWahWahWahWahWahWahWahWahWahWahWahWahWaaah!!!"

[Taichi]
"WohRhRhRhRhRhRhRhRhRhRhRhRhRh?!"
//Neither seems meaningful or a reference to anything. Which is odd, of course. Both of these are x13, though both have what counts for a single sound at the start. 14 still? -GHS

I went rotating in the fylfot shape of a swastika.
//Just for ners. As usual, no kanjis or 卍 would get in. Swastikas, as we all know and accept universally, only exclusively mean Nazism and have nothing to do with Buddhism. Nah, it's a troll, the swastikas are him being a good Nietzscheian, they have zero to do with Buddhism because this story doesn't, in the slightest. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"BREEEAKING BREEEAKING!"

[Taichi]
"Bwuuuuuuuuunh!!!"
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

And like that I transformed into a propeller and slammed into the ground.

[Taichi]
"G'waaaah..."

[Nanaka]
"Ahhh! Sorryyy!"

[Taichi]
"Blblblbl!"

A Comic Force Field?!
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
* Comic Force Field = Science-Taichinism.
A hyperscientific theory on par with Scalar
Electromagnetics and Ether Cosmology, or
devices such as the Meteoric Ascent Engine. An
acceleration and simultaneous mitigation of all
physical phenomena.

[Result]
the generation of a comic book-like

effect unimaginable by the normal laws of
physics. Statistically often associated with
unyielding childhood friend-like personalities,
it exists for the purpose of preserving the
nature of the character.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"You wanna kill me!!!"

[Nanaka]
"Sorrieee〜s!"

The girl puts her hands together in apology.

[Taichi]
"This damn maiden..."

Pah! I spat her way.

[Nanaka]
"Owieee."

[Taichi]
"Are you even capable of understanding the zeal of the people who gambled it all on the Messerschmitts!"
//Told you: HEIL TAICHITLER!!1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I'll be fine without understanding that..."

[Taichi]
"Don't go turning people into propellerish things dammit!"

Dusting off clothes and pride, I turn back towards school.
//誇り+埃 -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ah, waittup!"

She gives pursuit.
Lining up to me, she hops back onto the bike.

[Nanaka]
"Yott'oh!"

Keeping pace, slow and steady.
And still, this maiden...

[Nanaka]
"Yep! You calmed down nice an' nice this time as well."
//Likely from the panic attack he was having above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...eh?"

[Nanaka]
"Taichi's extraordinary, innit."
//Great + awful. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...huh?"

A dangerous person?
DAI KIKEN?
//Guessing, these kanjis don't sound familiar. -GHS
...me too, then.
No, more like, all us are.

[Taichi]
"Wahah!"

[Nanaka]
"?"

[Taichi]
"...'sly."
//Seriously -GHS

Laugh on.
However, who or what is this maiden?
However I look at her---

[Nanaka]
"Yott'oh!"
//Assuming the 'girl' tag is a typo. -GHS

She makes display of a little wheelie.

[Taichi]
"!!!???"

Her panties-?!?
Thought pattern interrupted.
//HACK shake screen -GHS
Unforeseen erotic events are my weakness.
Incidentally, the short term memory is also wiped without leaving one tiny bit behind.
What's with my brain.
Ah, who cares.

[Nanaka]
"Welll, ain't it hot!"

[Taichi]
"'Cause it's Summer."

[Nanaka]
"New school term, Monday, new meetings, farewells."
[Nanaka]
"And then, the Hokora."

[Taichi]
"Yes?"

Ho-ko-ra?

[Nanaka]
"When you complete this chapter, the choice to go to the Hokora will appear."
//As "scene" is explicitly used to refer to chapters in the Xbox 360 version achievements. So she is perfectly correct (provided you actually complete the routes). -GHS

[Taichi]
"No, that choice will not appear."

[Nanaka]
"Heartleeess!"

She was close to tears.

[Taichi]
"Why do I just have to go all the way up that mountain! I got school too!"

[Nanaka]
"'Cause there's nobody at school."

[Taichi]
"That is not true."

I say with serenity.

[Taichi]
"This is a dream, therefore, if I go to school everybody will be right there."
//The funny thing is that yes, this is a dream. And yes, everybody is there. He'll just pretend they aren't. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Nope, mankind has fallen."
//HACK shake screen -GHS

[Taichi]
"YOU LIEEEEEEEEEE!!!"
//Composed and calm and relaxed. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Nope, seems like it's reality."

[Taichi]
"I'm not listening! I don't want to hear that SF novel-ish crap!"
//See CCC0016A and others for why SF needs to stay like that. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"An SF novel, hmmm."

[Taichi]
"There, there, that topic is now all done!"

[Nanaka]
"...every time but every time, always in a different mental state, aren't you Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Every time?"

The maiden exhaled a very big sigh.

[Nanaka]
"If you're thinking you're oddly calm, you're rejecting reality."
[Nanaka]
"But just that you're not fixed to one specific tendency, maybe it's a strength..."

She grabs me by the lapel (while she's still riding the bike!)(what skill!).
//She's the Kamisaka after all. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"And thaaat's why I gotta work so hard every single tiiime!"

ShakeyShakeyShake!

[Taichi]
"oUUoUUoUU!"
//We're at 8 total (?????) -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Go to the Hokora, please, just go!"

[Taichi]
"Violence, violence no more!"

[Nanaka]
"Will you go to the Hokora?"

[Taichi]
"I will, I shall!"

Agonizing... dying...

[Nanaka]
"For sure?"

Bob bob steady nod.

[Nanaka]
"Goody."

Emancipated.

[Taichi]
"Pant, pant."

Non-disobedience appears best.

[Taichi]
But, why the hokora..."

[Nanaka]
"Nah, it's just that in that area, there's a god there y'know."

Our two gazes locked for a brief moment.
Then suddenly and simultaneously,
//HACK Nanaka zoomed 1 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahah!"

[Nanaka]
"Ahahahahahah!"
//HACK Nanaka zoomed 2 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahahahahahah!"

[Nanaka]
"Ahahahahahahahahahahah!"
//HACK 'clock' dissolve. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"He's got this amazing graciousness, y'know."

[Taichi]
"I wish you wouldn't just go on like nothing happened."

[Nanaka]
"Naaah, wanting to ridicule it is totally natural. If some guy saidd'at to me with a really straight face I'd laugh too."

[Taichi]
"Therefore you just said that to me with a straight face to make me laugh, have you."

[Nanaka]
"Right, but... this is sort of a serious thing, this is."

[Taichi]
"The god?"

[Nanaka]
"Yep."
[Nanaka]
"This is something precious!"

[Taichi]
"In what way?"

[Nanaka]
"Whatever, this is something p-r-e-c-i-o-u-s!"

Major emphasis.
//And blatant disregard of his words. Then again it's hard to have a dialogue when it's technically a scene replay. -GHS
Don't get it.

[Taichi]
"On that regard, who or what exactly are you?"

[Nanaka]
"...you would like for me to state who or what I am?"

[Taichi]
"Did you think I wouldn't get it?

I sweep my bangs with a 'fwasah'.

[Taichi]
"That this myself that I am could never see through, did you think?!"

[Nanaka]
"Ngh."

This is an elite cadet of young adulthood who is experienced in the ways of the world, having tasted both its bitter and its sweet! To deceive the eyes of Kurosu Taichi is something a clever Panchira-jou alone will never accomplish!"
So I proclaim with a swiftly thrust finger.

[Nanaka]
"'chira."
//HACK Nanaka panties -GHS

Panties visible for one instant.
//HACK out with 'em (earlier than the console version because, well, it's for an instant dammit) -GHS

[Taichi]
"uhWOOOOOOOOOOH!!!"
[Taichi]
"uhWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!"
[Taichi]
"Le bambole!!!"
//According to http://ts.revinx.net/project/dic/crossc.htm it's confirmed to be this: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%90%E3%83%B3%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AC And that makes at least two references so far to 1950-60s Italian movies. Of course, the title means "the dolls", so it could be just about Taichi being a living doll. -GHS

A nosebleed blows out as I was collapsed.

[Nanaka]
"Weeeak..."

[Taichi]
"Blblbl!"
//Blx7 so far (...) -GHS

Taken off guard.

[Nanaka]
"And even a nosebleed! What are ya, an '80s love comedy?"
//Probably not intended to be sourced, but to hint that Nanaka spent a long time talking to him about this stuff. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Foul play rejected!"

[Nanaka]
"That was because you're carelessly prying into people."
//...film noir now? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Doing that's normal."
[Taichi]
"When got close and talked to in a familiarly familiar way by a maiden whom I had no previous meets with."

I stand up.

[Nanaka]
"No such thing as having had no previous meets."

[Taichi]
"Double negative."

[Nanaka]
"What are ya, AT*K?"
//that has to be the lamest censoring ever. What's next, p0rn? -GHS

[Taichi]
"When did we also meet?"

[Nanaka]
"...a hard question that one."

The maiden looked in the distance.

[Nanaka]
"I can't answer that skillfully!"
//See CCA0017A -GHS

[Taichi]
"...this has been bothering for a while now."

[Nanaka]
"Mnyu?"
//Moe words. -GHS

'Mnyu?' now she blurts.
Don'tcha be disdainfuuul!
//Might refer to both... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"You bastard, you're not an earthling are you?"
[Nanaka]
"Huh?"
[Nanaka]
"What planet are you from?"
[Nanaka]
"Earth."

[Taichi]
"You lie, no terran like you exiiists!"
[Taichi]
"Why are you all fluffy-fluffy and airy! Ain't that weird!"

[Nanaka]
"Fluffy fluffy?"

[Taichi]
"Because you're sort... like the fluff of a big clump o' fur, or maybe that you're as slippery as the point of our talks, or maybe that your presence's just wrong, I can't explain skillfully but it ain't no mistake!"
//As above -GHS
[Taichi]
"Huh?! Could it be, could it be that I have been made to fall into captivity of this bawdy bewitching petal and that I will be made to spoil by having all my essences slurped out?!"
//その花弁に淫妖を? FLUIDS. -GHS
[Taichi]
"A temptress? A Delilah are you?!"

I become frightened as if a little kitten.
//NEKO-CHANS HAVE SUPER POWERS, LIKE KNOWING THE DAY YOU WERE BORN. OniIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiIiI-chAaAaAaAaAn. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Calm down."

[Taichi]
"Fnwah?"

I am hugged,

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaka]
"Seems you got a little nervous didn't you. There, there."

tightly.
A pressure that surpasses the softness, in which my head sinks in.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh...
[Taichi]
"These could only be the hills of Mother, two hills that for certain will make a strong founding stone for the developing eRoman Empire, such that the neighboring countries shall tremble before its very name!"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Rome Traditionally, there's one hill in Rome per each of these seven kings, hence the connection. God of the hill, seven Kings, seven hills. Also, Romulus was in the legends raised by a female wolf, among other things. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Don't go over my chest."
//As always, rub + consider. Previous sentence was the latter meaning. Very much a reading key right here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Been a while, boobies..."
//Intentionally generic. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I'm telling to lay off them."
//HACK fix 'em bugs! Also shake screen. -GHS

A knee flows into my solar plexus.
My body elevated into the airspace.
//HACK and more bugs, this time the screen shake command was wrong. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh'gwoh..."

I grovel down on hands and knees.
That was most uncouth.

[Taichi]
"...hmmm?"

[Nanaka]
"Anything wrong?"

[Taichi]
"Something."

I open and close in front of my eyes the hand that pulled that sexual harassment just moment ago.

[Taichi]
"A sense of physical discomfort. No, not quite. How to say it... hmmm."

Understanding vanished.
The moment I touched the girl there was an explosion of emotions that now have dishearteningly wilted.
As if I had been castrated.
//So many senses. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...did it hurt?"

[Taichi]
"Nah."

She's even worried that seriously.
I stand up.

[Taichi]
"Naaah, I have held something good."
//~various meanings~ -GHS

For the time being, back to the mark with the frivolous thoughtlessness of always.

[Nanaka]
"Come on! That is something absolutely ordinary for a lady to have!"

[Taichi]
"A certain kind of gentleness and refinement that, from within, whiffs a fragrance of valuable sweetness. An article, if I may be allowed to say, extraordinarily rare in recent years."

So I said in the manner of some critic.
//May be possible to tell who he is from the terms used, but I got nothin' -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Your words are most generous."

[Taichi]
"And now that things have calmed down,"
[Taichi]
"State your name!"
//Declare is taken... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...didn't I state it now?"

[Taichi]
"I heard nothing but how you are a maiden just happening to pass by!"

[Nanaka]
"Don'tcha call me a maiden just happening to pass by..."
[Nanaka]
"Me Nanaka."

[Taichi]
"Me Taichi."
//We've gone from the Beatles to the Monkees now. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Knew it."

[Taichi]
"How do you know my name?"

[Nanaka]
"Shi! Kuh! Ret!♪"

Many mysteries here, huh.

[Nanaka]
"How about leaving it at that?"

[Taichi]
"So, the main question then... who could you possibly be?"
//See CCA0001 -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Bai baaai!"

[Taichi]
"Waiteee!"

To her departing back.

[Nanaka]
"Whattattity?"
//*runs* -GHS

Ngh, that never-heard-before moe word.
//Now wondering if Nanaka, among the many monologues with infant Taichi, was trying to come up with new moe words (which of course would've been outmoded given the age difference). -GHS
No mistaking this, it's a word that is certain to attain the same level of worldwide popularity and frequency of utilization as Irkutsk Mania.
//I wanted to adapt this to Hepaticocholangiocholecystenterostomie Gravis, but my editor (who is inexplicably a sock puppet) said no. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you do desire me to deferentially overlook that pitiful affectation of a word, then confess at least from which star you come from!"

[Nanaka]
"I! Told! You! Ea-ar-th-ling I am!"

[Taichi]
"You lie, you have a different presence than an earthling!"

I took a most skillful Karade stance.
Karade is the ultimate martial art.
//It's only ever used to fight aliens for 'some' reason. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Heh heh heh!"
//Dunno why it's tagged. Maybe because it's not a loud laugh? -GHS

A white fingertip shot out, pointed at me.

[Taichi]
"?"

No, at something behind me.
Turning around, my field of vision was captured by the school for several moments.
No answers there.
My gaze returned to Nanaka.
The girl had vanished,
along with her bike.
Not a Phenomenon that's going to be settled quickly.

[Taichi]
"......mother of...?"

It was a quiet new school term, when even the cicadas didn't cry.
