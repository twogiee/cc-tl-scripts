[Sakuraba]
"Hoy, Taichi."
//HACK Flashback intro, doll. -GHS
Monday September 7, 1998 -GHS
This beginning part is, besides the troll and the first warning that Taichi isn't "right" yet (and will never be, for that), a very good test of reading comprehension. Being able to spot all the parts of the story and flashback this is made up from, and most importantly how Taichi has modified them, gives an excellent reading key for exactly the kind of similarities, overlaps, and connections that need to be made throughout. If you 'get' how this is just a riff on the same verse, you might 'get' the harder parts of this. -GHS

Oh my, Sakuraba?
//These doll changes are all slower speed. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Here, it's the script."
//See CC3028, Sakuraba still writes the script. That's even more hint that he's the guy that understands this. -GHS

A script, what might it be?

[Sakuraba]
"...you're the DJ aren't you?'

DJ... me?
It felt like it was true.
//See CCA0030 -GHS

[Miki]
"I'm sorta looking forward to your DJ, Senpai!"

What's that 'sorta'?

[Kiri]
"Me, I am looking forwards to Senpai shaming himself."
//See CCC3030. -GHS

You just decided I'll shame myself!

[Sakuraba]
"Howsit, that script."

Not bad, maybe, I think.
//"That one last chapter sucked ass, though." -GHS
Contents... I don't really get this. Read I can read, but I can't understand.
//And now he as the storyteller realizes that he's on the same level as the reader. But Taichi doesn't need to understand the script; that's the job for others, if they want to. See CCC3028, as well as the challenge near the end of this route. -GHS

[Touko]
"Come on now, what're you being all slack-jawed for? Be dignified already!"
//See CCD2002, exact words he uses at her. -GHS

Touko...

[Touko]
"What's that face for. Don't you got enough fighting spirit now?"
//Irony, given she lacks the fire to live for most of the story. -GHS

[Miki]
"Or maybe it's lovey-looove!"
//See CCA0027. See CCA0012: maybe he IS still in love with her, however impossible their relationship is. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Lovey-looove."

[Touko]
"I wonder if you just said something, you first ye〜ars!"
//Revenge for dumping the autograph on her? -GHS

[Miki]
"Said nooothing!"

[Kiri]
"Have said nothing like 'lovey-love'."
//HACK SECKUSY DOWLL -GHS

[Touko]
"Should I just slay them, I wonder?"

[Miki]
"Ahahah, this is bad. Senpai, help, we'll be slain!"

[Kiri]
"You can help us, Senpai so get on it!"
//Lit. "please", but tone is this -GHS

My my... I'm so convenient, am I.

[Touko]
"Really, Taichi, who are you allied with now?"
//See CCD5001, same word, so not overadapting. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"The-ere, done! Sigh, that was close..."
//See CCA0007 -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"What caused that? Inadequate contact?"
//Symbolism. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Nope, severance. And that's why I toldja to go buy a better type of cable."
//Taichi is disconnected from the world like an antenna with a snapped cable. SY[snip] -GHS

[Misato]
"But if we had done that, there would not have been enough to cover the cost of yakiniku for everyone."
//There wasn't money for a connection that wouldn't sever because there wasn't enough to get everyone food. There's enough symbolism to make Equilibrium look almost not targeted at people who get there a 'little later' than most. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"What're even your priorities, nee-san!"

Hahah, 'nee-san'?
You mean 'onee-chan', right?

[Tomoki]
"Shaddap you, I'm at the time of self reliance, ah' am!"
//He's not talking but he's talking, and that's obvious since he's hallucinating... but how often has this happened so far? Like with the further weeks showing sepia during flashbacks while the first week doesn't, it could very well be the same here. See CCA0011A, it's unfortunately not visible here but it's the same as his "pwease" back there. -GHS

So warm.
This world is so warm.
//Sepia=warm, memories are better than reality... or the sunset of reset is. It's not gonna work like this. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Senpai, I can't do anything, but I will be cheering!"

Yusa-chan.
She was in the Broadcast Club, was she?
//Well, the people can't be eight; it says nothing that they can't be nine. -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi, your uniform is disheveled."
[Youko]
"= the heart itself is disheveled."
//See CCD5001, supposing it's a direct reference. -GHS

Youko-chan...

[Youko]
"Here, I will adjust it for you, yes. Embarrassing Mutsumi-san is completely unacceptable."
//Because she prepares his uniforms, even if she's not anywhere? Nah, possibly meant to be that she now cares about Mutsumi, see CCC3012B. -GHS

It felt sorta... nostalgic,
but,
suitably... gentle.
Suitably... rigorous.

[Sakuraba]
"I want to asexcessively go on a journey. Wanna go?"
//無性 is also 'asexual', and given Sakuraba... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Don'tcha go..."

[Miki]
"I'm always thinking of doing that, but what do I do about the travel expenses?"

[Sakuraba]
"Managing with just what you have somehow is what makes a competent Traveler."

[Miki]
"With a monthly allowance of 3,000 yen that's just sooo beyond even imagination."
//See CCD4003 -GHS

[Touko]
"Don't you let yourself be fooled now! Sakuraba's family's made of naive spoiling. His 'just what you have somehow' must run in the hundreds of thousands!"
//See the coins scene - it does. -GHS

[Miki]
"Gwyoh!"

[Kiri]
"Hundreds of thousands?"

[Misato]
"Suspension, Sakuraba-kun!"

[Sakuraba]
"What for..."
//HACK -GHS

[Touko]
"As long as you overnight at hotels while traveling, you still have a long way to go, mister!"

[Misato]
"Ah, Peke-kun, it is time, are you sufficiently prepared?"

[Miki]
"Who knows, it's his first DJ, maybe some demon will appear."
//HACK -GHS

[Kiri]
"Maybe a snake will appear."
//lism! -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Don't just assume something bad'll happen just because you never know what'll happen."
//HACK -GHS

[Touko]
"Well now, go do your best!"

[Sakuraba]
"Do your best!"

[Yusa]
"I look forwards to this!"
//HACK wow, this smile may actually be intended. -GHS

[Youko]
"Take the tension out of your shoulders now."
//HACK to sky, it's even more similar to CCC3004 now. -GHS

Ahhh---
This is just right.
So fulfilling.
//See CCA0014A -GHS
In the convenience of this all, anxiety flashes by. However,
//First sign. -GHS
can't I just feel so much happiness now, with this?
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
                    Well guys,
          how about some horsing around?
//HACK out the fade -GHS
Tuesday September 8, 1998 -GHS
HACK zoom -GHS
HACK ADV mode -GHS
And then I was awake, as it was already past noon.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

I slept over at school again, dammit.
//Misato again. -GHS
When I have to go back to my house in order to live my days like a decent person...
But getting this thing ready on my own is really really difficult.
Senpai was so admirable.

[Taichi]
"Sooo then now, shall we get down to it today as well?"

I deliberately vocalize.
It feels that if I don't do that, I could forget words themselves.
Beginning work.
............
Suspending work.

[Taichi]
"Hunger."

The lunch that Youko-chan used to prepare was now also no more.
I have to arrange for everything myself.
Inside the school there is, in addition to that disgusting curry bread, some croquette bread.
If I go out into town, well, I guess there's all sorts of stuff I could eat.
I pass my gaze on the surroundings.
...empty packets of curry bread were scattered about.
//Yes, he eats Sakuraba's thick, hard bread with all its spicy curry inside, likely slurping out the filling before stuffing his mouth whole with it. -GHStillHereToHelp
I can't bring myself to even taste the croquette bread, however delicious it should be.
//See CCB2010, CCC0025. Symbolism. -GHS
Silent corridors.
Silent club activities.
Silent days.
The obtainment of what I desired.
The heart is at ease.
A world where the wounding of others cannot be.
A world where I am never made to be aware of how much of a good-for-nothing I am.
A world where I can live honestly about the impossibility of my ever improving.
//Hints that this is far from over start here. -GHS
Living life in honesty with myself.
Living the springtime of youth with close friends.
Though these two concept are often used as a set, in my case that fell completely apart.
In some parts distortions will be necessary, I suppose.
For example, that online RPG character I used to have had only Intelligence and Speed at 99.
//This is separate from the Phantasy Star II comparison. Not enough data, but 1998 already had Meridian 59 and Ultima Online, plus early Korean MMOs, not to mention MUDs and the like. -GHS
Rest was at 1.
But he was so strong.
Once balance is indirectly rejected, what is correct becomes unknowable.
...just like with me.
But if I am here,
I can live with gentleness in my heart.

[Taichi]
"...there's lots of memories, aren't there."

I try peeking into the classroom.
I have no purpose.
//HACK G-G-G-G-GHOOOOOOSTS!!1 -GHS

[Miki]
"---"
//HACK nope -GHS

[Kiri]
"---"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Miki]
"---"
//HACK doll -GHS

[Kiri]
"---"
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

A conversation between these two.
//He's totally peeking at the real two of them. -GHS
These two were living together all day
while never becoming co-dependent.
//That's not quite what co-dependence non-means (either English or Japanese). I suspect he's using it as synonym for Alter Egos, which are impossible. -GHS
One side sought replacement for something that
was there before,
//Kiri -GHS
one side arranged that reliant girl into a tool.
//Miki -GHS
An inhumane composition.
//See CCA0030. -GHS
And at its utmost extreme,
the two had touched each other only a little.
The discovery of that tangent point is a
blessed happiness.
However... are they even capable of eventually
reaching that point, now that they've returned?
For Miki to regard Kiri with honesty, a large
amount of experience will be necessary.
For Kiri to be released from the curse of her
guilt it should take time.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

Let's stop here.
Think as much as I want, I have no more ways to contact these two.
Crossing is now impossible.
All ways of intercommunication are closed.
//通 -GHS
And,
the two have run over here.
//HACK out -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

Making so much noise, they run past to my left and to my right, and disappear.
The tip of the nose is gently caressed by soft breeze of girl. As if a lingering scent.
But it is just illusion.
The gate stays unclosed.
There is no more need for it to imprison,
//But it could never imprison him, see CCC4012 -GHS
because this is a world where no one exists who can hurt.
I will not be reproached should I desert during school hours, of course.
//Like he never was, because he can escape the guards easily. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

I ended up coming here.
Just because it's a shop I'm accustomed to.
//And conveniently there's no one there for him to talk to. -GHS
I scrounge food and drink as appropriate.
//The curry bread was probably the day before. -GHS
For whatever reason, here the phenomenon of saprophagy does not occur.
//Because fresh food is still brought in. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

I decided to post a memo on the wall,
//Because the shop still operates. -GHS
as I end up doing every week.
                           X/O
                       Sweetened bun
                        Cup Noodles
                       Green King Tea
                       110￥+180￥+110￥
//Not signed. Same "date" as Sakakibara diary. Day of Cross, Month of Loop. See CCZAS. -GHS
An act devoid of meaning,
but in the procurement of food there just should be some measure of hardship.
Because abandoning even that is to arrange for a slow death.
Whatever happens, however, my being in a position to dream is unlikely to change.
//In positive or in negative. -GHS
So ironic.
//See CCZAS. Indeed. -GHS
I decided to eat in my own classroom.
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
Touko always sat here.
Because she could not but be there.
Head held high, chin jutting out,
so cold and dignifed she was when she walked.
//She's probably doing so right now. -GHS
She was not accustomed to it, perhaps, so that if a hand was extended in help just once she immediately grew corrupt.
The Winter Child, Touko, grew dangerous when melted.
If merely treated kindly, her wall would end up torn down.
Her clumsy tactlessness expressed her lack of skill at socializing.
However much reliance there might be, an appropriate distance ought be kept.
Complete dependence will be all kinds of painful,
because what can happen is mutual destruction.
Those who don't mind can go and be dependent.
//I truly cannot tell if Tanaka's still sorta half-assed in the end, or if he's just trolling that hard. In the end, for some things, there's nothing but conjecture. -GHS
I don't want to.
There's that about Youko-chan, however.
It seems that I like beautiful and still things, very much so.
It resembles the feeling of admiration.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
HACK classroom instead. -GHS
Is that girl crying on that other side, I wonder.
And with no one to rely on.
In the end, I betrayed Touko twice.
//When he rejected her and when he sent her back. No sell on that "experiment". -GHS
...will enduring that be possible?
//Both her and Taichi. Taichi's sins are not gone simply because he changes so as to effectively vow not to commit more. -GHS
I let out a heavy sigh.
//HACK more ghosts -GHS

[Touko]
"---"

And so I heard those contemptuous, lisping, high-handed words she had for what I did.
Only within my ears.
//HACK out with doll too -GHS
The club room.
The place was a gathering area.
//See CCA0007 -GHS
Their profiles, naturally, are nowhere.
//Class is still in session. That, or it's 4 AM. -GHS
The relationship between the three of us was, well, I could call that wholesome.
A relationship that could exist anywhere, anytime. Something near that.
Consequently, for me, it was like a miracle.

[Taichi]
"..."

There are no words to speak.
Just the dazzling holiness of things released from grasp, that the more my thoughts went over imagining them, the more my throat grew tightened by the creaking discord of my what's in my breast.
//Regret for having let that get away from him. Though it would've happened anyway; and perhaps it has. -GHS
I stood up absent-mindedly.
//HACK zoom rooftop -GHS
Once again to club.
To what extent must I persist to get everything in order even if alone?
I had found a way of pacing myself.
If I truly give it all, I would be done in three days.
//Which points out the troll in the Misato sendback - no need for Youko to be there - as well as show how can get everything done here in time despite not working for most of the time. He did Monday, he's doing Tuesday, he'll do Saturday, and most of the rest he'll be mad. -GHS
This is something I've done all over again so many times.
I had the knowledge.
I had resolved on a procedure as well.
Therefore, I want to do this while deliberately taking time,
while detouring on diversions.
In ways different from Senpai's.
//Misato kept meandering about and refusing to get to the point, whereas Taichi wants to simply take breaks and pace himself. He'll fail here. -GHS
In a certain sense, in what she did there were also detours.
Sometimes I do think about that.
Disregarding efficiency, including wasteful processes:
but it is unimaginable that Senpai, always supporting the club alone as she had, would not know the basics.
A gulf in the family,
and then people disappearing.
For Tomoki and for Senpai both, that was reason sufficient to end up in flight, with all their strength.

[Taichi]
"Let's put some pep into our slow-handed tardy club."

I vocalize.
And today once again I spend all my daylight in labor.
//HACK zoom rooftop, and use the damn correct one... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Evening, is it..."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

Sunset.
All living activity on the surface of the Earth had frozen,
nevertheless the sky still did its job over and over again, with integrity.
As if a hologram of Summer, left behind inside a mirror,
//The Melty Blood term for Hologram Summer is actually 幻影の夏, but this is so similar it works just too well. Also 1 Cor 13:12, all but explicit here. -GHS
it disappears at the speed of light, late behind the real image.
And now, a spot of leisure.
//Things are slowly, slowly, slowly dissembling. -GHS
An instant in the history of the universe is for a person just one week, week 'X'.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"...should I just go home."

I know that no rain will ever fall, but I still return the machines and the tools to the prefab.
//I.e., he knows rain might fall. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Good job today!"

I give my farewell to that place where no one is, and get on the way back.
On the way home, I drop in to the shopping street and replenish my stock of food.

[Taichi]
"Hoh..."

I arrive home and feel relieved.
Regardless of whether people exist or not, that doesn't change.
//COUGH. -GHS
I cook leisurely.
I cook the rice in the garden.
Simple cooking, with trash collected in a plastic bag.
There is no necessity to put out the trash.
//Or to put up bills. But he does that anyway, doesn't he. -GHS
For a single week, one bag is sufficient.
//Either he seriously cleaned up his act, given the absolute mess his room is known to become, or he indeed means one day. -GHS
The evening breeze tastes burnt.

[Taichi]
"Dammit!"

In a panic to the courtyard.

[Taichi]
"...bwaaah, all black!"

As expectable, inedible.
Gotta recook.
One time or another, I had ended up burning down the house.
//Which is odd. How many weeks have passed since CCD5001? And only now he has problems...? -GHS
That one was nasty.
Because for some reason I can't feel at ease spending time at other people's homes, I ended up staying in the club room.
//Who knows what actually happened. However, After Story starts with a scene with the Club in the club room at night, so Gunjou truly doesn't care. It may just be opened 24/7 anyway... -GHS
I must be careful.
If I burn myself up by mistake this will all be meaningless.
//See CCB2009, but he also singes his bangs on the candles. -GHS
............
A late evening meal.
By the time I had finished eating, is was fully night.

[Taichi]
"...ngh."

I could feel some type of reservation in my heart.
Has it come just this night, I wonder.
I've got to compose myself.
And therefore, I decided to keep a diary.
Keeping one's hands busy is very important,
and particularly at times when one's tiny heart feels like it would explode.

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm, what happened today... was,"

I diarize the details of club life.
//See CCC3017. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, next up there was..."

And there my pen stopped.
Nothing at all.
Nothing has happened.
//That hasn't stopped him from diarizing before, see Week 1, especially see CCA0015C. Three quarters of that stuff was made up! -GHS
Not even the possibility anything would.

[Taichi]
"...therefore,"

Therefore?
The hell you've been keeping the diary for, you.
I closed it up. This began to taste bad.
I search for something to do.
//HACK It's the Kiri Route(s) inverted! MADNESS!!! -GHS
I light a candle and try to read a book.
//So he was writing in pitch-black darkness. Yeah, sure he was! Anyway, he seems to start from books, and then goes to read a comic book. Seems intentionally discordant. -GHS
Soon my focus scatters.
I will never have the chance to ever read the continuation of this comic, either.
//He's not reading a manga? *badum-tish* -GHS
My stomach felt heavy.
Dammit.
Tomorrow I will go to a bookstore and hunt down the complete comic book set.
//And that's why he could never read the conclusion ever: he didn't own it, as the implication is that the comic has ended its run and is available complete. Pure troll. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, gotta sleep!"

I dive onto the bed.
//HACK to black. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Get sleeping!"

I try raging.
//To exhaust himself? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Noooise! Noooise!"
//Seems to be a variant on "gyaasuka", see CCC3018 -GHS

I try swimming.

[Taichi]
"...haah, haah!"

I got tired.
//HACK starry sky -GHS
The wind blows through.
Leaving the window fully open is just fine, as there are no insects.
A cool Summer.
//It's probably early Spring by now. -GHS
I am grateful for it now.

[Taichi]
"Making use of this tiredness, I shall fall asleep in a single beat!"

Let's count sheep.

[Taichi]
"One scapegoat, two scapegoats..."

Sheep are mundane so I tried counting goats.
It felt like it was sort of wrong,
and also that it was so extremely correct.
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

With no one to call out to, there are no little pleasantries to deliver.
Yet there was a little bit of expectation within me,
for that girl's omnipotence.
//Nanaka is omnipotent, of course, Holy Spirit and all. -GHS
But that would only be self-convenience.
Shaking off regrets by force, I set up to walk with energy.
To school.

[Taichi]
"~♪"

And my whistling, as well, this morning just kept growing husky.
//This seems oddly ambiguous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's set off at a nice and slow pace today too, then."
//HACK zoom rooftop -GHS

So announcing, I immediately set off to work.
Take out the tools stored in the prefab, and line them up in the pre-decided order.

[Taichi]
"...whew."

Inside of me, this was already a point where I could pause.
//There it is, he's slacking off and doing nearly nothing on Wednesday. Well, I edited these three lines, I can pause now. -GHS
I enter the shade under the tent.
I do not sleep,
I just lay down a bit, that's all.

[Taichi]
"Zzz."
//HACK out -GHS

............
//HACK back -GHS

[Taichi]
"..bWAH?!"

I ended up sleeping like a log!
And if in the end I spend a whole day doing nothing, what will I do?
Five revolutions of anguish (oh no).
//Not a figure of speech that I can find. See CCB2002, going with the same joke. Maybe he just tumbles around the floor. -GHS
I set out to work, in a haste.

[Taichi]
"OwwwCH!"

I hurt a finger.

[Taichi]
"Injuries are nooo good! They are no good I say!"

There are no doctors.
//That he'll admit to. -GHS
If I ended up with some disease that I can't treat... ah well, not that there's anything I could do.

[Taichi]
"Ugh."

This ended up a hassle.
I bring out a water pistol, and fire towards the outside of the fence.
//Meaning they're on the premises, possibly even in the prefab. Where Misato would've put them on Sunday evening as she came back from the Camp and immediately set to work on the antenna, probably into the loop phenomenon. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Pew!"

The collected water jet is promptly scattered by the wind, morphing into a mist.

[Taichi]
"Ah, a rainbow!"

A tiny bridge of seven colors.
//Gen 9:13. It's the bow part of cross-bow, after all. -GHS
It adorns the dusk with refinement.

[Taichi]
"Hooh."

It set my mind astray a little.
//True mind screw starts about here. But it's peanuts compared to what came before - provided you understood it. -GHS
The Hills to School.
A thing of memories,
//HACK Yutaka & Nanaka - now that's an odd composition. -GHS
with Yutaka, with Nanaka.
//One is the boy he couldn't forgive, the other the spiritual guide and Holy Spirit. Odd, but extremely appropriate. -GHS
Especially.
//HACK just her -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nanaka."

On her name passing my mouth, my physical heart feels like it's being seized.
Why did she even persist in being my ally to the last?
//HACK and out -GHS
The last?
It's not yet certain it is.
//It can never be the last; the problem can't be "solved", not before the end of the world. -GHS
It's just... she merely doesn't want to show herself to me, doesn't she.
It is in Nanaka's character to make things clear and definite on parting, no mistake.
If she fell in love with someone, she'd confess to this partner of hers by sending them flying, no mistake.
//Did Taichi's eroge memories (his new-oldest memories) and his true oldest memories (Nanaka) get completely and irretrievably contaminated? A good possibility. That, or Nanaka was a hardcore eroge player and that's where he got it. That's... wow. -GHS
...but I might be making too much of this.

[Taichi]
"Heeey, Nanakaaa!"

I try calling her.
//HACK oh, it was a typo all along. -GHS
It's as if she would turn out all of a sudden, riding her bike, off from a blind corner of the hills.
That is what it felt like she would.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah!"

Reading,
a manga however.
//Because manga are Japanese, comics are foreign, so he's regressing. No, wait, Japan is Narnia and, uhm, you know what maybe it's not that important. -GHS
Time passes leisurely.
And I myself must absolutely live deliberately.
There is no need to hurry life along.
If hurried, I would just explode.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah..."

The manga is funny.
But if there is something that leaves me dissatisfied, it's in how its subject is so bustling and lively, perhaps.
//A more profound statement on the hollowness of using narrative as socialization surrogate for Japan's locked-at-home culture in the background of the question of whether hikikomoris are truly withdrawn from society or are merely deluding themselves is, sadly, hard to find. -GHS
So many people appear in it.
Right now, that takes just a minute amount of toll.
//Week 4A -GHS

[Taichi]
"On the mountaaa〜ins, deep in Saitamaaa〜!"
//Do not seem to be real lyrics. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Strand~ing♪"
//It can mean "that's right" with a Kansai ~nan, but see CCA0002: same word as what can happen on these hills/mountains, and we know what that represents I hope. Also, that's the province where the doll town Kounosu is, see CCA0018B. As usual, the truth comes out of his mouth without him being openly aware that it is. -GHS

Work proceeded as I created an impromptu song.
Anything I don't understand I immediately check.
//Dot dot dot. -GHS
Time is wasted with moderation.
Books brought from the club room and the library one by one fill the rooftop to the brim.
//See CCC0044, he's beginning to Youko it up it seems. -GHS
As returning them's a pain, against my better judgment I cram them into the prefab.

[Taichi]
"...still, if I were to really send an SOS, there'd lots of more efficient ways to do it."

As there's no EM waves, picking a location for the wireless transceivers would be a safer and faster bet.
//See CCD0022A, Misato claims the mountains are a problem. Credibility unknown. Yeah, he COULD just write a book or something, but truth is, few have heard of Romeo Tanaka as it is; if he were an LN writer, that'd be even less so. -GHS
Senpai must've realized that,
how neither people nor anything has survived.
Therefore, as far as results are concerned, club activities are the right choice, and it is appropriate for the club to include a degree of waste higher than the intrinsic.
//The problem is, this applies to before the loop exactly as well as it does afterwards. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whew."

And when I noticed, I have come all the way to the shopping street.

[Taichi]
"Ngggh..."

I ended up as a night walker.
And furthermore, 'when I noticed' is not quite correct.
//Possible somnambulism. Possibly that it's actually night, since he has his dreams/flashbacks in his sleep throughout the day. This "when I notice" is here commented upon, but there's several, one of the most suspicious is CCA0013. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wanna go home."

I was tired of running around.

[Taichi]
"Good night!"

A salute to myself.
I wrap the sheets around me.
//Futon wa? -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

And yet I couldn't just fall asleep.
//Thursday September 10, 1998 -GHS
HACK zoom rooftop -GHS
I'm looking down on the world from the rooftop,
on countless daily existences squished down under an infinite variety of roofs.
And then at the mountains. At times at the sea.
What scenes could be perduring beyond those I could not even imagine.
//It's heaven out there. -GHS
On occasion, the City would dispatch its feeling, its very breath.
//Heaven, occasionally, farts in his general direction. Hmmm, I'm not sure if that's the best way of putting it. -GHS
I had begun to forget it, so faint it was.
Because it had no desire to become the core of this, definitely.
//Seems to mean 'to expand into a big city' (AKA "to become a fallen world for humans to live in") -GHS
And with these eyes I have, stared at by people at any time, anywhere, I knew.
//Hair??? -GHS

//Friday September 11, 1998 -GHS

On waking up, I am alone.
In solitude.
People are essentially alone, or so I read somewhere.
//Quick search seems to be Hunter S. Thompson, but of course it's almost a cliche' by now, even in this VN. -GHS
Any living creature could be said to be that,
but to be aware of it is only for people.
And I end up thinking that, among living creatures, insects might have the highest degree of perfection.
//See CCC3009. He's yearning non-sentience. Like Misato wants to be a robot, Taichi acts like an insect masqueraded as a human. Or, in short: craaawling in myyy skiiin... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngggh."

I'm sleep deprived.
And yet, if I don't go to school...
If I end up dissolute here, later on it will be painful.
It will become an additional burden on solitude.
At any time, at any moment, people feel the pressure of those others around them.
Being occasionally released from that is pleasant.
If that restraint is excessive, the heart distorts.
And yet, if there is none, the self would end up spreading endlessly.
//The self becomes the whole world during excessive solitude, or, loss of adherence to reality, or, see Taichi. -GHS
But no self can exist that has that kind of density.
If it is diluted endlessly it is indistinguishable from nothing.
I cannot imagine it,
a self that has assimilated with the world.
//I can imagine at least a couple of variants, and so could Tanaka. This is naturally troll. -GHS
Wouldn't that be lonely?
Wouldn't it end up forgotten, that tiny little physical body that is deposited in the very center of a self that has become equal with the world?
//This explains the Cross World psychologically. -GHS
But to begin with, why is this thing, this heart, even dwelling inside of people---
//Dun dun DUNNN -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

Trying to enter the school hurts.
Heart hurts.
'Cause it's just an empty box.
When it was once a jack-in-the-box.
//Something you wind up and wind up, and then out comes, perhaps surprising you, perhaps looking creepy, but otherwise completely harmless. Another metaphor for the truth about Taichi. -GHS
Now it's no longer there.
It's a box of nihility.
Or rather of fear.
//These are both heart and school (was that necessary to add yes it was yes it was). -GHS
That's what it felt.
When before there was someone close, someone close who would respond when touched.
I discarded reason and went inside.
Ha-AH!
Vocalizing is hard.
Construction of language is hard.

[Taichi]
"...all that... aside..."

That's bad, I got hoarse.
Speaking's waaay hard.
Doing it consciously, especially.
Therefore, there's always emotion to be found in subjective descriptors.
//Here Umineko enters in its Core arcs. -GHSoHelpful

The pigment in my hair was lost via yelling.

When I was a child, because of the vagaries of the Japanese writing system, I totally thought she was called Marie-Ann Townette.
//Katakana includes katanas, and that's why ninjas are Japanese ~logic~ -GHS
And I also thought that Angkor Wat was a guy named Ang Korwat.
//ious CR in the original line. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat FWIW, but none of these things seem to matter at all. -GHS
I thought that a 'turtleneck' was a 'totalneck'.
//See CCA0015C. Apparently he learned. Not that those aren't trolls. -GHS
And as for the Heart of Neolithic Orkney, that sounds very much like a giant oarfish saying he art of Neoli the Corkney.
//Except! One of the most famous ruins of neolithic orkney is Skara Brae, which featured in both The Bard's Tale and Ultima, both classic RPGs. One of the developers of both also worked on Wizardry, which was so popular in Japan it had Japan-only sequels and inspired the author of Dragon Quest. Reaching, but only so much given how much Taichi seems to be into this. -GHS
Well whatever, not worth worrying about that.
Yu.
                                                      8
//See CCZAS. The key 8 on a kana keyboard triggers the 'yu'. This is impossible to understand without Tower of Friends spelling it out. -GHS
Anyway, this is a corridor.
There is no one.
There is nothing.
//Classes are in session, duh! -GHS
Things stirring... none.
Cats, y'know, they're veeery sensitive to stuff that moves.
//And, as said, that's because they're nearly blind in daylight compared to humans. -GHS
That is part of their specs.
And so, that is also part of my specs.
//The extremely subtle Taichi as Dog vs. Taichi as Cat argument. He can't be a dog; dogs can't go into boxes. and he's obviously into one. Even though Cross Channel is a cat and FlyingShine is a box. -GHS
The Japanese term "shoganai", commonly translated as "it can't be helped", literally means "there are no ways", in the sense of specifications.
//Literal. -GHSarc
It means that no finished product can be delivered if there isn't some design documentation.
Or so I say, but that's just a setup to get Tomoki to straight-man me with a "don'tcha toss out bull that the programmers'd believe!"
//The development team of Cross Channel might be one of the most trolled groups of people in VN history, outside anyone who thinks CC is good because of its vocabulary spam, superficial archetype deconstruction and incomprehensible ending. I wonder if there's a single person at Will/FS who knew this is a Christian story. -GHS
Tomoki's a nice guy.
//I totally wrote 'nice gay'. -GHSob
I really love club activities.
//HERE topic whiplash works. -GHS
I'll go, and just watch me getting enveloped by an overwhelming feeling of omnipotence even today!
I still have a number of memories with Tomoki.
The two of us, and with Sakuraba that'd be the three of us, we had readied a SIStem to have fun wherever and whenever! (†)
//HACK zoom rooftop. Maybe I should've macro'd this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............aaaaaah"

Seemed "it" was close to exploding.
"It" is of course "that" kind of "this" which cannot be described with a mere "it".
//Penis. -GHS
"It" is "it", "this" is "this", naturally.
//Peee-nis. -GHS
Therefore I swallow.
Swallow. Swallow.
Swallow seven times.
//Hooooooo. -GHS
And then swallow.
//And that's the cursed eighth. The annoying momlike existence is gone, but is what she has done gone from the heart? Not while he's alive. Evil is tempting, always. The want to go back, not to the place where he belongs, but to the festering rot of fallen reality is always there. -GHS
A most delicious meal.
Shrieking in the heart.
Belly's filled.
What exists on my inside lays heavily on the bottom and doesn't come out.
What a PITA.
//Saka-ben (or Kumamoto-ben, Japan's confusing and full of lolis) http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BD%90%E8%B3%80%E5%BC%81 this one seems appropriate, since it does sound like "except from the back". -GHS
Club tends to lag behind.
It's already Friday.
Taken! Too! Light! Ly!
//I'm so lucky with syllabification. -GHS
And therefore I decided to work.
First part of our Newman Movement.
//Sounds oddly Nietzscheian, but that's it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Woooh!"

Five minutes later, I was thinking about all and sundry and it started leaving a bad taste in my mouth so I stopped.
That was the end of the first part.
It's alright. There are two acts.
Once the first part ends, there's the second act.
Mother of---?
//As random as it has always been. -GHS
"First part" and "second act" aren't connected are they not.
There were some pretty weird words there.
//HACK to sky -GHS
A spray of water shoots through a sphere colored orange that had been hung in the sky.
//Water pistol again. -GHS
Nope, it ain't spherical.
That thing might be circular, dunno.
//I.e. 2D? -GHS
The flat sun theory, yeah!
//Just that 'sun' typo fixed, see CCA0008. -GHS
A world without nothing moving kills my heart. Happen, something!
Just the sun being mobile all slowly slow is unsatisfactory.
//Same. -GHS
Because I can't perform a GET on it.
//"Sure. WALK to the sun." -GHS
That light-weight heavenly body can't even become a black hole.
//Light/right, really? See CCA0002. That is correct, the sun'll become a red giant. -GHS
It feels like it's a loser.
//See CCC4016 for who's the winner. -GHS
Go learn something from V861 Scorpii!
//See CCC0006B. Red giant + Scorpii = Red Scorpio? See CCC4025. -GHS
I wish something'd happen that was much more like 'dun-dun-dunnn'.
And I wanna see a white dwarf.
//Being that he's a dark nukige survivor this can only be read to mean one thing in English, unfortunately. In the original, despite the kanji, 'mitai' could be read as "white dwarf-like". -GHS
I'm sure Sakuraba has.
//Pun with 白色矮性, "white dwarfism"? Taichi's the White/Silver one of the duo. -GHS
Would the premeditated crime of feeling above the role hit the target?
//Laterally 'fit the bill', but it connects to below. It also refers to the sun, see CCC3022 where he uses the same word. -GHS
Those white-collar criminals guilty of being unsatisfied with their given fields merely acquire targets for archery use.
//HACK and out -GHS
Look at me please.
//And there we go again. -GHS
Ah, branch, branch!
//木 (tree) + the 支 in 支倉 (Hasekura). Zero odds of coincidence. -GHS
The braaanch! The braaanch!
It destroyed the fence.
An Imaginary branch has come!
//See CCA0002 and more -GHS
I can't see it!
Amazing! It's perfect!
//HACK to rooftop -GHS
And then it fell!
The power that draws the Air branch towards the ground... it's Pulling Power!
//引く力 was only ever used in CCA0002 -GHS
The fence was wrecked as if by a pair of gigantic industrial-use pliers.
//That's what he just did as he goes to try to kill himself of course. Odd he wouldn't use the weak spot - but does it even exist? The pliers are what Tomoki uses to wreck the antenna so there's a pair in the prefab, see CCD1001 (they're just 'large' but here = chuunidenpa). -GHS
I shall name you Attractive Force... no, because this matter is most grave, Gravity!
//Pun seems a little more obvious in Japanese, though perhaps not to this extent. -GHS
This is an important discovery.
The beginning and the end of the Age of Discovery.
//Specific term for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery but we seem to be a little late for that. -GHS
The part of the fence that was cut down glides down awkwardly.
Words without number,
swimming in the brain,
taking the synaptic jump.
//A real thing? http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_does_a_message_jump_across_the_synaptic_gap_and_passes_to_the_next_neuron though this still seems to be about how he's about to jump down. And he's likely still there when he starts hallucinating all the next stuff! -GHS
Nooo, nooo.
Touko came to attack,
//This is like how she took an arrow for him in the end of her route; so much that the very CG returns just below. -GHS
leaving no space for the interposing the deep emotions of meeting and parting and then reuniting.
I can't locate Mother either.
//See CCC0008B, CCC0036A. Another intentional non-sequitur. -GHS

And then she's defeated.
//Killed? See CCA0019 - same term, and as Tomoki says, not that kind of 'fainted'. This reminds me sooo much of the true best VN ever written, Atashinoriri. -GHS
Sorry Touko!
Squeak, and my heart aches like a living thing left out in the freezing winter.
//PCP CCB2012 for the same reason of 冬子 vs 疼. Jikuri doesn't seem to be a known SFX, or anything at all, except... 軸力/axial tension? -GHS
I felt blood.
Liberation is necessary.
I must shine by myself.
In order to redeem the stigma, I woo Kiri.
//Perfect dreamlike confusion -> sense of dissatisfaction as he goes after Touko -> Downfall, Touko is "dead" -> he pushes himself on Kiri. It's the same pattern as that route. -GHS
In order to relinquish the honor, I woo earnestly.
Woo continuously.
Raising the loudness of the wooing.
Uncriticizable Nanpa.
//Let's go with the tech term. See CCA0008. -GHS
But a favorable response in good color I don't get.
//Just means favorable response, but also literal because she went white and, most importantly, bled. Interesting he considers this just him hitting on her; that's very likely not incorrect, given what The Great Pattern means to him. -GHS
How come?
That would be because Kiri is scarlet.
//And there you go. 赤の他人, a 'red stranger' also means a 'complete stranger'. Red because of foreigners being classically associated with red hair (though today it's blonde). A bit too lateral to include, however. -GHS
Regret.
Fuck, fuck!
When it ought be better to regret doing than to regret not doing!
I just can't get adjusted to being alone, you know.
Well, Kiri, have a response to me's feelings!
//See CCA0030, Sakuraba, same "ora". -GHS
So I proclaimed while freely making use of monologue.
Monologue has the meaning of speaking by oneself, however, with regards to videogame lingo, it is utilized in the nuance of descriptive and narrative text, so people who like to nitpick should start attacking that.
//It's meta because this is teh videogames. A more correct term would be 'soliloquy', rather than monologue. -GHS
Truth is, I hated the word 'proclaim'.
//Hence why I had to translate it so specifically alll the way through. -GHS
It's sorta half-baked, should I say.

Gyarandou is nice.
//http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/1788928.html Not to be confused with Gal Undo, which is a fighting game Cancel Move where you travel back in time and kill the parents of the guy you're fighting, so you automatically win the match. -GHS
Yeah, let's do that.
Then well then.
//Miki -GHS
So I gyarandou'd while freely making use of monologue.
//Reflects above. -GHS
Daaaymn I'm so awesome.
//Seems to be just an old-fashioned term. -GHS
I like how it resembles the impact of the galaxy-like word Gyarak'shi too.

Better than that spiraly thing that's the >K<ana 'no'.
//That decodes to K. Maybe kill... maybe that was the hint to look on a kana keyboard? -GHS
So, Kiri, how about, 'K?
//TL NOTE: K means の means no wait what the FUUUUU-GHS
Kiri said with an edge that wasn't of a wooden sword:
//Kiri's about sharp knives, and see CCC4014 where she's a wooden log (due to :reasons:). More contrast this way. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...are you worried about the gender of fried chicken?"

Ahhh, I am, I very much am!
Well, it can't be specced.
//Shoganai in kanji = callback to above. -GHS
The flashbang had exploded.
//That's likely the SFX it actually had. -GHS
We had died.
With great armed skill you fought and well, but the scorpions were so many in number that defending from the stabbing of all their poisonous stingers was impossible.
//More scorpions, does seem like it's all pointing to Nanaka. See CCA0004: Touko had poison tips, too. Line was split like this in the console version anyway. -GHS
Eventually your consciousness grew faint, you collapsed, and the scorpions that submerged your body enjoyed the deliciousness of human flesh for the first time in a long while.
Your adventure has ended.
To foil the evil plan of the Warlock Morlock, you must return to Paragraph 1 and redo your adventure from the beginning.
A sufficient blessing of the Goddess in your next adventure we---
//Split as in the console version. Ah, it's a choose-your-own-adventure book. Hey, those are like printed VNs! This is extremely telling: it has the bad ending from what is an obvious expy for VNs mixed not just into an event that is very likely not to have happened at all, but one involving Kiri, meaning that death in CC as a whole is meant to be taken as nothing but him meta-hallucinating. Goddess sounds like one of the rare non-Christian references, but given the scorpions, it's just the complementary troll-filled hint that this is a reference to Nanaka. -GHS
I apologize for getting a book I read a long time ago mingled with my thoughts.
//HACK to black and wait before returning -GHS

Naught else may be expected from one who received formal Ichihara training.

That is incorrect.
That is considerably unusual.
//Hmmm, 縁は異なもの[味なもの] ("the ways people are brought together are inscrutable"), second part optional. -GHS

Uhmmm, it is heterogeneous due to feeling like extra-super competent.
//Osaka-ben, going with slight off-tone -GHS
What does one do about humans that have no failings?
Well, once it has been put into words, it is merely a human with an extremely low probability of failure.
Like in a situation where a normal person would die a hundred times, they'd survive two hundred times.
//This seems wrong, but 回生 is also resurrection. Hmmm. -GHS
That is almost like an ah'tress! That is the performance of a Holywood protagonist at the one hour, forty-five minutes mark!
//Now this is odd. The terms should be "actor" and "hollywood", but the transliteratearearezddfweasdings are off - in the case of "aata", which should be 'akuta', waaay off. And Hollywood written like that gives me just http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Holywood which is... hmmm. -GHS
Before the last ten minutes, their performances are at the absolute highest, indeed.
And with that I thought: anti-movie.
A story where until the last ten minutes he does nothing but take naps, then at the end he goes into Hyperman Mode and defeats the bad guy.
//That's your average poorly-written bottom-loaded piece of crap, lots of stuff like it. Guessing troll. -GHS
And then without a damn trace of logical connection I had one more idea:
a story that has its beginning with the Fall of Mankind.
//Cross Channel is pre-apocalyptical in the strictest of terms, therefore what's at the start can't be the destruction of mankind. OTOH, this is him chuunin'. -GHS
That, yah.
Really feels me-ish.
It's a hymn to the self.
//BTW, check the etymology and definition of that. Still religious in meaning. -GHS
But which is vulgar now, that or making oneself great by tearing down others?
Well, what do we do about that?
I asked out.

Waaay philosophical. Bummer. I can't beat this.

What else from Mimimi-senpai.
The weakness of this person sort of resembles the tactile sensation of boobs.
Therefore great love is the true intent here.
//Given she was in love with him and very very much from the start, I'd say it's hers, but leaving it ambiguous, as it could be the reading key for CCA0010 - his true intent was getting consoled, not diving into her boobs. -GHS

That we'd fall in love is just something established by the scenario's Settei.

It seems I ended up as someone who just looks at panties.

That'd be good thing to be.
And I, for roughly fourteen hours, fixed a stare on the underwear.

As far as time is concerned it was an event about four seconds long.

Since we're on the subject, legend has it that the reason the Japanese roast and eat octopus was in memory of the Great Fetish Fire of 2067, which ended the great majority of tentacle porn (and tentacle porn writers, though some historians deny this ever happened because it's yet controversial whether any ever existed). -GHS
Consciousness wrung to observing the present world.
//HACK slower back on this -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hah, hah, hah..."

I had just about begun to lean myself out of the fence that I had wrecked by myself.
//Now go back through the VN and find how many imaginary 'branches' there are. Let's start with Mutsumi telling Taichi to sweep Youko's ex-room in CCC3012B. And did he really do all that stuff above after breaking the fence, or was he always here? And did he break the fence or just use the available hole? -GHS
Stiffened fingers are grasping the wire mesh on the left and right.
This was just barely the last moment indeed.
The fence had been excavated into door size.
My doing. I have the recollections of that.
No sooner than they had been memorized they had been torn up into tiny pieces and mixed with other languages, that I could no longer decipher them.
//See the top, that's why he can't understand the script Sakuraba wrote. And therefore, the real difficulty in understanding all the VN. It's actually easier to do so as a foreigner, paradoxically enough: the less you're bound to the conventions of read Japanese, the easier it is to notice how much Tanaka hides in plain sight. -GHS
My fingertips are as white as plaster.
Perhaps because they have been gripping all along.
I restore my center of gravity to my back.
//He was leaning forwards. -GHS
This is safe. I won't fall.
Still the fingertips eat down into the fence. I peel off with difficulty.
//Because his recovery was automatic. Given everything, this would normally require a memory reset. -GHS
Mild pain.
When I turn them upside down, blood was surfacing in a reticulate.

[Taichi]
"I...

I can't believe it, I was trying to commit suicide.
Death is out of the question.
Because you made a living by killing so much.
//The 14(?) at the mansion and possibly all of humanity in the same sense, not the rest. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Isn't that right... Youko-chan?"

I call her, but the girl does not turn up.
//I don't think it was her who yanked him up. This was him on his own power, and nothing else but the memories to help him. This is the great big change, the rest is just him... kinda realizing it or something. The simplest message is against suicide. -GHS
I hug myself.
So cold.
I become unable to sit still.
I start to run.
Inside the school building.

[Taichi]
"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
//あx14 (including the one in the wa) -GHS

I dash.
People!
People!
Anywhere, people!

[Taichi]
"Miki, Kiri!"

Not here.
I throw around the desks.
//This desk. -GHS
Knock them down one after the other.
//This desk. -GHS
Textbooks slip down to the ground.
//This desk. -GHS
The two are not among us.
//This desk. -GHS
Terror.
//This desk. This desk. This desk. This desk. This desk. This desk. -GHS
In this room there is no one.
//Is an eyesore! ...seriously, they translated it like that? I know it's about the eyes like it is here, but... -GHS
I run away.
A thin and narrow space.
A sense of impeding danger that says I would never survive should I be subjected to a pincer attack.
The enemy are the Nihil.
//FINALLY getting out of that Nietzscheian bullcrap. -GHS
Those bastards are everywhere.
By now they are engulfing me.
If I keep this up I will spread, and end up diluted.
//See above, the Endless Self thing. -GHS
I pass through the staircase to the Second Years' classroom.
Touko's private room.
//Possibly literally so. It's not like her family can't pay money for this, can they? -GHS
A tiny fortress, separated from its surroundings.
But its master is not here.
She was sent back together with her stiff determination.
But wouldn't it have been nice if she had stayed here for just a little more?

[Taichi]
"AAAAAAH, AAAAAAAAHHH!!!"
//x6, x8... 7, 7 -GHS

Running and falling and stumbling I fly across the gate.
I roam downtown,
in search of the living.
Whether or not these dregs of a crossed world that these are, and nothing more, ever held the living in the first place.
//DUN DUN DUNNN no wait wait wait I mean SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
But I cannot but search.
I cannot but seek people.

[Taichi]
"Ah... haah, hah...!"

Building by building I examine the houses.
For a half day of madness,
I continued to seek.
In front of the gate I lose my strength.

[Taichi]
"...'mmit now... there's nobodyyy!"

Howevermuch whateverway I search,
there was no one anymore anywhere.
//Notice how he never ever goes out that trail into the outside world? Or search for anyone but Kiri, Miki and Touko, who would be in the classrooms? -GHS
But in exchange for all this fatigue I had calmed down, just a bit.
It's because to make strenuous movements I needed to make use of the brain, right?
//Uhmmm... but it does connect to CCD5001, something that is a purely physical activity due to bodily want is a necessary "waste" that allows the margin for higher, spiritual, mental functions. The mind can work when the body shuts up, to say. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah."

That's right.
Stimulated, I head to the mountains.
I couldn't believe my eyes.
There's nothing here?
//His eyes see nothing. Think about that. -GHS
That blurry, indeterminably incomprehensible space had vanished without a trace.

[Taichi]
"...that's absurd."

Hasn't this thing continued to exist for many thousands of weeks?
//This isn't the first unlooped week, in the slightest. It couldn't have gone away in the last five days. Simplest explanation: it never was there. Also, see CCD0023: the gate isn't there on Monday, why would it be there on Friday? See below. -GHS
Nah, it might even be tens of thousand.

[Taichi]
"Why has it gone now!"
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

                   Resentment.
                  Desperation.
              Feelings I am incapable
                  of describing.
                      Pain.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Shackled by what is brought out from the bottom of my heart I stood, petrified.

[Taichi]
"Why..."

I want to run away.
//He wants to return to a fake idea of a world that never existed. He is indeed lost on these apparently silly hills forever. -GHS
An everyday emotion.
It existed in this frantically cultivated, worthlessly tiny heart of mine as well.
//HACK one last big PITA before leaving. -GHS
Mimi-senpai,
//HACK -GHS
Tomoki,
//HACK -GHS
Kiri,
//HACK -GHS
Miki,
//HACK -GHS

//HACK out -GHS
I can't really laugh at all you guys.
However the gate is no more.
I can't go home even if I want to go home.

[Correction]
the 'shift' was no more.
//Indeed, as said above the gate wasn't there before Sunday in CCD0023, though on Monday there was a "phase shit", see CCD0101. -GHS

Alone.
In a world that has crossed,
the crossing is at one single point.
Their respective flows are still continuing.
//With the implication that they STILL ARE. The idea one can live at the center of the X is pure delusion, this has been the theme all along. Ergo, what he's doing must be different from that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh... that's right."

This town of nihility where I now live... is now---
Past its point of crossing.
Understandable if looking at the very character "X".
//This is his rationalization, which is of course nonsense. If he's thousands of week past the point of crossing, how does everyone hear his message? The delusion comes in simple examination of what he's saying: the world that exists at the center of the X would no longer be at the center of the X because it's moved on. So just where is it? This sounds so much like a deep statement that is yet ultimately nonsensical. Now see the end of CCD4003: Miki said it, yet once again. -GHS
Two lines. Their respective flows continuing.
//Except the lines that make up X are segments, not l-- OK that's overthinking. -GHS
The crossing is an instant. Yet the flows don't stop.
Did I ride a third flow here?
//See CCZAS - of course, he rode the flow of Denpa to this place. But if there's a third flow, then it's an asterisk, specifically what's referred to as a 'full-width' asterisk, "*" instead of ※. And that's an euphemism for asshole, as uhmmm "illustrated via Sakuraba". IOW, this explanation is literally full of shit. -GHS
Nah... gotta be something else.
//Really now. -GHS
This town, now, is just the dregs.
The afterimage of the Cross Point of two continuing flows.
A Cross Point where Real has passed by and became Imaginary.
//HACK new lines! -GHS
This Phenomenon is, I would guess, something like two sheets of paper overlapped and shot through with a thumbtack.
//See CCZAS. This doesn't make literal sense, as the sheets aren't moving, and if they were, the thumbtack would either move with them, or tear them apart as they move away. The metaphor works if considered laterally: it's a sheet of paper containing a Settei pinned onto a moving reality. And you thought elephants on a turtle was odd. -GHS
And I have been existing overlapped with worlds A and B both.
A convenient world, as if modeled after a patchwork.
//Of VN and anime tropes, of hallucinations, of religion, of reality... but the most interesting is the patchwork is one of hearts, see CCD1001. -GHS
However, worlds flow on.
Make no mistake that this hologram of the present will someday vanish,
//It's an explanation non-explanation. How does he know this? Because the metaphor says so? The metaphor he made up about something he all but states he doesn't understand, because there's no way he can understand since he physically has no means to? Ah, but he can understand, as long as he doesn't know it explicitly. -GHS
like the tangent point that was the gate has vanished.
//The center of the X has moved on after a random time. Still a full-width asterisk of an explanation. -GHS
Or perhaps, is this merely a decay in the functionality of my eyes?
//"Is it all this pretentious sci-fi crap that doesn't make sense and that I pulled off of my literal full-width asterisk, or am I just censoring the world"? Being it's a religious metaphor, of course, the answer is neither. One more thing that's not been considered so far: staring too much at computers (or reading in general) will kill your eyesight, slowly; that's why all the reading and gaming is making him like this, as in at least one meta-explanation, he's also an stand-in for the hikikomori readers of VNs and such. -GHS
And at the moment when the sky itself has vanished, I will---
//...will live on, provided Christianity is true. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hahah."
[Taichi]
"Hahahah."
[Taichi]
"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahah!"
//Ha x18 8-1=7 -GHS

This laugh is,
a blessing.
How much time it had passed before the gate had disappeared, I have no idea.
//Has he never even looked at the gate before here in any week he was here after CCD5001? I tend to doubt it. Another explanation: he hasn't been living at the hokora at all; since there's no reset, and he's meta-aware now that he's finished his religious awakening, so he simply doesn't reset. But that means he hasn't been going to church every Sunday; hence, he's forgetting. -GHS
Maybe it was kinda quick.
But maybe it was a number of months and years that would boggle the mind.
//The number of years that have been since the Great Flood is unknown, or, this isn't Young Earth Creationism. -GHS
Whichever it is, I will have to patiently endure this.
In times when the place of refuge grows farther, the struggle is to the bitter end.
//Which is why he removed it. Then again, the other side is death, metaphorically even if the literal is troll, although it's not troll and yeah I'm going cross-eyed. At least there aren't allegorical layers being added every five minutes to no payoff like in Forest because the author can't hack it, let's go with that. -GHS
I won.
That alone is certain, isn't it.

[Taichi]
"If I have no place of refuge... outside of living on... I've nothing... nothing..."
//No places to escape from living life, no ways to go 'home' manually: ergo, no suicide. NOW he's rejected death! After all, there's two forms of suicide: wanting not to live, and wanting to live in this dreg of a 'real' world. -GHS

That is good.

[Taichi]
"Just dessert, yes."

Just dessert, oh true self.
You shall (I shall) be kept here until you die.
//Also "keep deadwood on the payroll". -GHS

[Taichi]
"......hahah."

Within my chest, emotions without number blend in shape cruciform.
//Because he's become Christian, duh! -GHS
An Air tapestry is being knit.
That is the glittering sparkle of the varipatterned varicolor of emotions.

Shouting.
//tried joining that once but they only ever drank alcohol -GHS
Up to the boundaries of voice.
Vocal cords vibrate, enough to tear apart the sky.
That's no longer voice.
It's noise.
It could be nothing else but the physical squeaking creak of the phenomenon that is my eigenexistence.
My field of vision covers with special effects.
//109 is a common one, though 10 is my favorite. -GHS
Hallucinations that took the shape of my consciousness.
Beautiful as if lace it was, yet, it was being knit out of hair-raisingly eerie emotions.
Shake it, and you can get a peephole's glimpse on a wasteland of impurities.
Is this... me...?
The eyes are perceiving what cannot be seen.
//Visuals (hee hee) -GHS
It's an illusion, I think, but on the other hand I also get that it is truth.
Ahhh, this is,

Denatured Consciousness.
//Except for fixing the typos, that's exactly what it says. I actually suspect the typo is intentional, not just because like all pseudoscientific crap it's pure troll, or because with that added 'e' and 's' it's now 14 characters rather than 12 (spaces excluded), but also because it's never been fixed in any version. This is far too obvious an error to not be caught. I fixed the typos, but put two more pointless characters to keep the 14 letters total. -GHS
Trance. Insight. Enlightenment. Divine Revelation. Mystical Experience. Those are the names it is called by.
//Carriage return in original line is spurious according to console versions. Not that it matters here, since that's where the line breaks anyway. -GHS
The Phenomenon where a soul reaches the extreme of an impasse, and that layer becomes connected to the subconscious.
//Psychological Explanation at the very least. Though since all science is troll, that's only an explanation for those who'll settle for it. Taichi himself does. -GHS
I had been driven into a corner,
//See CCD5001 - so was Youko, if there's any difference between the two. -GHS
by means of stress.
Hmmmmmm?
As I stood there stock-still struck by this electric shock, the side of my consciousness ached.
//Yeah, go on and avoid KAMInari. -GHS
There is something on its side.
//See Week 1, where he keeps striking the side of his head. That's why smacking his head works, like in Another Story when Miki batons him. Is it a tumor? Well, not necessarily, but since Youko has been described as something that can be read as 'tumor'... -GHS
That is the layer of the precipitated knowledge laid to keep the complicated emotions at a distance.
//It's all the bullshit we've read so far, IOW. And it's about to talk. So how reliable is it going to be? -GHS
The profound consciousness proclaims:
//Oh, it's just a random thing, not God, nooo not at all. -GHS

I exploded with understanding.
The pressure had nearly mutated into a physical phenomenon, pinning me down.

Beginning and ending become connected in the shape of a circle.
In the shape of a circle.
The circle of understanding.
//After all, O and X must coexist. And, X has created an O and eventually will be able to connect to the O. And that's how something that was born evil comes to God: the same way a persimmon tree can be born from peanuts that have been simply named persimmon seeds. Add some stuff about curry and full-width asterisks and rape, and there's Cross Channel. What's so complicated anyway? -GHS
My awareness had been,
from the very beginning it had been, denatured.
//HACK faster transition (flashback isn't used) -GHS
That day,
I completely degenerated.
And so I have remained, to this very day.
//Continuing the idea that his white hair (perhaps even his eyes!) were a result of that moment. -GHS
A bypass to the depths, that someday soon it might just explode.
//Possibly already has, after the training camp failed. -GHS
An always-on connection.
I cannot control the amplitude of the vibration of my heart.
Instincts scattering and spreading,
rationality going mad,
nihilistic conversations and thoughts working to protect the consciousness in the stead of rationality.
//All the weird stuff, again. But this also hints that it should be examined seriously: it's merely the *protection* of consciousness, not its complete removal. Which is how this is a stream of bull that yet makes sense. -GHS
So as to cover with muddy water the sewage being blown out.
//And serious examination reveals Taichi's error: there's no sewage down there at all! The problem is the muddy water, not what's below it. Or rather: there's sewage covering up the muddy water; and muddy it may be, but as Taichi says, in the desert even that is precious. -GHS
So as not to be eradicated by the world of rationality that spreads around it.
//It's difficult to tell whether this naive idea that there are "sufficiently correct" people is purely Taichi or if Tanaka still believed this... but that's more of a philosophical/theological nit. -GHS
And then,
the recollections of that which is so far gone floated up from that tar-like substance that was the deepest layer.
//This is the true payoff of keeping the oldest/psychopath pun, see CCA0001. This is his problem: not memorizing or having memories, but recall. It's all in a stream of tar and mud, but it's what the layers LOOK like, not what they actually are. -GHS
This is a story even older story than when that of the denaturing of my consciousness.
//He's kidding himself if he thinks the denaturing happened there. It crystallized, perhaps. Nothing else. -GHS

"Sorry, Taichi."

Why... her?

Violent emotions that are not covered by the basic descriptors of happiness, fear, sorrow, pleasure.
The emotions... of a baby.
//To come to Him, pure like babies they must be. This is also his screwed up perception of time. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I... remembered... about mother..."

This heart of mine I thought so tiny, yet what a thing was kept hidden within.
It's as if you're dead exhausted after a long voyage in search of someone, and then the very first time you turn around there the person you were looking for was, wordlessly following you, grinning into a smile.
//How I wish that is what it felt to analyze this. Ugh. -GHS
It felt as if everything could unconditionally become positive.
//The love of a parent. ...and all sins will be made nothing but the stumbling of babies as they learn to walk... -GHS
Vertigo.
There is one more recollection.
One more memory that I can scoop out.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
Darkness.
The time of my babyhood was an existence together
with darkness.
//See CCB0018. And it's explained! -GHS
Nanaka... mother was hugging me as she laid
down in pitch-black darkness.
//Given all the things about Taichi's eyes, this darkness may merely be her being near dead. -GHS
There was no conversation.
A mother and a child sinking into the darkness.
What was the reason for that I have no idea.
//This is nothing but pure conjecture, I admit, but could he be the son of that tortured and killed servant couple? Slightly more probable that his backstory is actually Youko's, which he pushed on another persona to keep himself sane - provided Youko never existed, however, rather than just after the Mansion events. -GHS
For long long hours,
mom was sorrowful, and seemed terrified.
That's the feeling I took from that.
Father was nowhere.
Dead, likely.
That, one way or another, I had understood,
//When he was literally weeks old? Yeah, keep projecting your current knowledge on your memories, buddy. -GHS
together with how I had not been endowed with
the words with which to console her.
Mom was hugging me close.
A girl with no one to rely on.
//Oedipuz Komplex, ja! -GHSigmund
As if fighting with the darkness of her fear.
There we laid, both of us, incapable of crying.
When I came to notice, I seemed to have
become capable of seeing mom in the darkness.
//He just finished using the very word 'darkness', kanji and all, to describe his mother's fear. That's what his eyes actually allow him to see, the truth of people below what they seem to be - just what he says Kiri can do. And this explains his night vision: he sees, even if he doesn't necessarily understand. Like the script all the way above, though examples of Taichi telling the truth without telling it are nearly everywhere. Note that "and then I noticed". -GHS
A few months after birth, the central nervous
system switches over completely from the
mesocortical pathways to the visual cortex,
a period of time taken for the development of
peripheral functions suitable for the outside
world.
//And here begins the final scientific troll of Cross Channel... though not the last one. See book. -GHS
Inside the darkness I, wordlessly, kept
seeking mom.
//...though there's always how it could be a miracle... but let's also add that this is where he grows his preference for sexual harassment (that's what she plays around with him, though hers seems a whole lot healthier than Youko's) and pointlessly talking on, as that's what she was doing likely to cover up her own fear. He inherited a lot from her, a lot that only on surface looks like stuff he got from after he was broken and rebuilt by Youko. -GHS
That beckoned a physical mutation.
Mom was a youthful prisoner of fear, so she
did not possess knowledge.
//And given how bullshit-filled his talks with her are throughout the story, it's not impossible she was the one to make this up. Maybe to explain the illness he was born with, as well, which she should've been well aware of, given it should be readily visible. Nothing but a mother playing with her son, in that sense -GHS
The rod cells and the cone cells, likely
undergoing optimization had, at that time,
acknowledged their host as a creature of
the night,
//Just look at the ruby text spam! Tanaka was laughing so hard when he wrote this... -GHS
deciding to increase the amount of the rod-shaped
cells distributed.
The unspecialized cells around the retina
create a pseudo-tapetum lucidum.
//I love how 未分化細胞 keeps turning up around all sort of wonderful illnesses such as leukemia, see CCB2012; what if it is true? -GHS
Overlapping errors, maybe, or the cellettes
failing to lose their transparency as they
merge into the glassy body, maybe.
//As described, this sounds like he would simply become blind, or at least have a severely impaired vision. -GHS
What it was, I have no idea.
The result being that I was endowed with
a structure where the light entering my
pupils would be twice overlapped on the
reflective cells.
Structurally speaking, it is identical to what
dogs and cats have.
Also, these eyes had higher sensitivity
for things moving than ones still.
//See CCA0030 for the only thing he sees this way - Youko, who might not exist at all. Particularly odd considering that in Misato sendback, see CCD1001, he just uses a seeming sixth-sense that can't have anything whatsoever to do with sight. -GHS
As a cat plays around with tiny insects,
I, myself...
//And finally, see CCA0002, where Touko says the idea that brain cells can undergo mitosis. Was that even Touko, or did Taichi hallucinate that as something consistent with this? -GHS
In the heart of the night, mom had kissed me
so many times.
What kind of influence could I have gotten
from that?
//Momcon, from the looks of it. Possibly his saliva fetishism. -GHS
The memories that can be extracted from the dark
rushing torrent of the subconscious were those,
no more.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Right.
Mom had died.
She had died after that, I'm sure.
That is why I was put into custody of the Hasekuras.
...which leads to now.
Well... what is the Nanaka that I have been seeing?
No way---
...let's stop here.
//Same word he used for Miki and Kiri's presence. Suspicious isn't the half of it. -GHS
Nanaka has been, to me, an unconditional ally.
She has always been watching over me from the bottom of my recollections, definitely.
I want to think that.
The world can go know the truth.
//And that's all you get, readers! No clunky rainbow-colored truths or enough stupid to send me flying into a rage at the mere thought nearly two years after reading it. -GHS
I have no need to know.
Merely having been loved, to me, it's--- more than plenty.
//See YMK/Aeka again. and particularly interesting given that Aeka's hair and her relationship with bullies... but that's another story. -GHS
And with the regainment of tears, next came the recognition.
//See most Sendbacks, he couldn't cry... though he could cry just fine all throughout, so it's more troll anyway. -GHS
If people merely are... there, that's enough.
//This is the lesson that he keeps learning, isn't it. -GHS
Their place, their nature, their gender, it does not matter.
It's a want for them to be there.
People want people to be there.
They want to feel them nearer.
To be reassured that someone will be there even before they extend their hands.
That is what they want to obtain.
And therefore, people call out:
with telephone, with words, with letters, with behavior.
...with the radio.
//...with VNs. And despite this all but autobiographical tale, some actually wonder why Tanaka hasn't had a blog or a Twitter for years. Tanakafags, you fail forever. -GHS
So that they can get someone somewhere to listen.
That is their wish.
Mimi-senpai was right.
She was running but she was right.
//Note the lack of anything that could sound even remotely SOS-like. After all, her SOS via the antenna was always intended to be her asking for help by putting that together, not talking to the world via it. The subtle implication is that the whole thing was never about looking for "certain" kinds of people - "friends", in ToF parlance - but for a want for people to be there. His flight was ignoring mankind all along, and her flight was not from the absence of people. -GHS
And so I am a person.
Ahhh.
I can't believe this.
Disturbed by my deep consciousness, I've been innocent-mindedly destroying humans, that's what.
//Because he's been hurting them, we're supposed to understand... but now that he's admitted that he doesn't know, it's more hints that this is just how he's pretending they're not there. -GHS
Seeing as my urge to cooperate was being obstructed by impulse, that'd be obvious.
And yet I... was a person.
I can live.
And I will live with that sense of fulfillment.
So the gate may disappear, and the world may change, perhaps.
//The world will go on ahead... -GHS
This is a Cross Point.
If it becomes past, then its afterimage alone will be what is beautiful.
//I've been looking at this 10 year old crossing for 18 months by now, so I guess I don't really have any grounds to disagree. In this metasense, the Crossing will never go further even as the world goes on. -GHS
The time will come when it will become an illusion and disappear.
//Eh, there'll be reprints, but the older version is easier to manipulate. And it doesn't have multiple screwups like changing the prompt for no good reason, missing some ruby text including the Tomoki is Food joke, a far worse pixelation effect, and changing the developer's name so it requires redoing the opening into something way way uglier, as well as ruining one of the jokes/major interpretations (FS Phenomenon). Nor a lack of every single change and improvement made in the console versions, though I guess given the scope of the job (which I know altogether too well), I could see why. -GHS
How far ahead will that be?
Next week maybe?
The week after that maybe?
Next year, maybe?
...and between that and my death, which will come first?
Dying is out of the question,
for if I die, this irreplaceable feeling would be crushed into dust.
//The return into the "time loop", not his actual death. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I'm gonna live."

I will struggle to live.
Until that very last day.
And then I will wish,
I will wish that before my eigenlifespan ends, somehow,
//Not before his life ends... -GHS
for the sky itself to finally pass away.
//...because he's wishing for him to be there after the world ends. Rev 6:9-11. -GHS
Nanaka is smiling.
//HACK It's now translucent. Unlocking the normal version anyway. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Sorry... I could leave you with nothing more than that..."

What she left me was a string of characters comprised of the world's most extreme cliche'-class words, and a craving to move throughout the course of my entire life towards being an ordinary person.
//My ass she ass! See CCA0004: like the Tasaki Store owner's parents left him more than an inheritance, Nanaka left him with way more. She's the one that leads him to the hokora, and the first words out of her back in CCA0003 were about God and religion. What she left him was also a big finger pointed at the hokora, which is about Christianity and religion. By Rule of Greek Chorus(?), the same was true of the Tasaki Store owner. That's why, in the Materials Book interview, Tanaka says the Tasaki Store owner has a pretty detailed personality for what should be less than a minor character. -GHS
And I told her,

[Taichi]
"Thank you. I'm alright now."

Nanaka replied,

[Nanaka]
"...OK!"

It was an ear-to-ear full face smile of blessing.
//HACK display the CG fully, then leave. -GHS
And then, simultaneously with my correct understanding of Nanaka,
my heart gained a transcendental serenity.
//HACK slower back -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

I stood there, alone.
In the heart of that grove, the only one thing remaining was this being, this being called me.
It was silent.
To a level that I had never experienced before in my life.
//It's a very specific quietness that's instantaneously recognizable to those who've experienced it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...the impulse... is gone...?"

The violent stirring of my heart which pushed me out of control had... disappeared.
It seemed so excessively quiet that even the sounds inside the body could be heard.
I become anxious.
I could no longer feel the violent ego that until now has been the tyrant of the imaginary landscape in my mind's eye.
//How odd he'd phrase it this way, isn't it. -GHS
Did peacefulness really come to me,
or is this but a moment's dream?
//He learns his lesson throughout most routes, then forgets them via time loop; he learned his lesson in Youko's route and Sendback, and doesn't have the time loop to blame when this week comes and once more he's forgotten; so there's no certainty that he won't at least move towards forgetting once more after this. That's why the Lewisian concept of constant reminder fits so perfectly here, especially considering his Sunday noon visits to the hokora. -GHS
Discouragement.
But... this is normal after all.
Here, individually, people nurture their emotions.
//個々に - the pun was always there... -GHS
I lay a hand on my chest,
and, tightly,
take this upon myself.
//Going with lateral. Now he's gonna have to carry that heart with him 'till death. No tricks. -GHS
Which week this is as far as numbers go I have no idea.
How many dozens, or perhaps how many thousands have there been?
//Notice the counter is technically fitting with 1771. -GHS
Therefore, let's just call it Memorable Week X.
I'm not a dagger anymore.
//And the week, and the "time loop", and murder... see CCZRooftop -GHS
And like this, I finally had become one, single, individual person.
Too late, however, and now it's probably meaningless.
//But isn't it odd? He said the problem is that he hurts people, not that he doesn't want them. But of course, that was his lie all along. -GHS
But... tears came from my eyes.
Tears of sadness.
Tears of happiness.
The two sides mixed, that words to describe them I had no more.

[Taichi]
"Hahahah... hahah..."

I cried, laughingly.

[Taichi]
"YAHOOOOOOO!"
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
HACK zoom rooftop -GHS

Next day. Rooftop. Club activities.

[Taichi]
"Well, let's give it all!"

The antenna's sorta becoming an objet d'art though...
//OTOH, *this* describes accurately how it was to write the damn monograph itself. -GHS
If I give it all through this one day, I will make it somehow.
//HACK zoom these, slower transitions -GHS
Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS
HACK zoom -GHS
Sunday.

[Taichi]
"...I did it."

One way or another I made it in time.
I relaxed.
Because Sunday isn't even a half-day, this is a big problem.
//11:31 hint -GHS
For the time being, it's complete.
I'm enveloped by a sense of accomplishment.

[Taichi]
"Wholesome so wholesome!"

I look at the sky.

[Taichi]
"...right, Senpai?"

I look at the sun and get sleepy.
//Had the wrong sun kanji again. -GHS
But if I fall asleep here that'll be a big problem.
//Hmmm, see CCE0001? -GHS
Let's just broadcast right away.
I take my seat.
I was dreaming.
About this kind of silly innocent club activities, about an ordinary life as if an ordinary student.
As long as there are memories, I will be fine with that.
I will be satisfied---
Draw in a breath,
An evening wind that still captured that scent of Summer kidnaps it with a mischievous sleight of hand.
//Uhm, but now that doesn't make sense. Oh, whatever. -GHS
So, to broadcast.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club."

Even if I understand its futility,
I will cling tightly to it, and live on.
I pushed out these forceful words:
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
     Are there people still living out there?
//No tags for these. Not that he's talking to anyone but the reader, as this is how the message makes it to the other side in the first place. -GHS
Should any be there, please listen to me.
I have no idea of what situation you could be in,
right now.
You might be in despair.
You might be going through hard times.
And maybe... you might even be on the very
verge of death.
And to all, to all of those people, I
will say this:
...please keep living.
//This message is weak. It's intended to be, as this is what should come through in case all else is ignored and ununderstood. Pure ablative writing. And still, too much focus on hiding stuff and being clever rather than on story itself, though I suppose being overtly religious wouldn't have sold as well. The target audience is what it is. -GHS
Just... keep living, please.
Will you not please just hang around?
That, simply put, is what I ask of you.
Because, should there be any person who is hearing
this voice, then I won't be all alone.
Because the very instant that a listener
comes to exist, even if we're not aware of it,
there will be a connection between me and you.
//The distance between the reader and Taichi was always, from the start, the same as the technical distance between him in the Cross World and the people in the real world. It's a single frequency, after all, on a comparatively obscure media for the time. The odds someone would read this and the odds someone would catch that signal are roughly comparable. -GHS
That is what I think.
A person is born alone, and will die alone.
//Ah, the "mothers are fictional" theory, that's widespread. I subscribe to it, but only as an extension to my continued belief that women are fictional. (I admit, though, that it's more of a hope.) -GHS
Even if he comes to be on good terms with
someone else, in essence he is still alone.
//Since Taichi's felt loneliness inside himself is inevitable, whether he is literally alone outside of himself is irrelevant. What he feels will - ought - be the exact same regardless. -GHS
Even communications with reciprocal understanding
are not the co-ownership of everything.
//See CCA0006, CCA0025C, CCC3025. This is a repudiation of Alter Egos and the impossible perfect codependence and phenomenization it attempts. -GHS
This thing, this living, is a lonely thing.
The ways with which to swindle that loneliness
are... precious.
And I think, isn't it just for that purpose...
that other people exist?
Do you have any memories of being together
with someone?
Those are things with value.
Please make sure you never forget them.
Because those are the sole and only support
for someone who is facing loneliness.
Ideally, there would be a someone existing nearby.
But now, even something that very ordinary is
no longer guaranteed.
//Another lateral justification besides the ultimate loneliness of life: the growing egotism and distancing of people. And this was 2003 commentary; though it would've applied in 1998, it's even more poignant ten years later, when the end of the current civilization(s) is visible to all but the most foolish. -GHS
And yet... I will be here.
So that you can still be there.
//HACK to black, ADV mode -GHS
I close my eyes,
and flood my words with thousands of feelings.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
  This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club.
//HACK just a little waiting -GHS
    Are there people still living out there?
//HACK wait, ADV mode -GHS
So I prayed---
//HACK NVL mode (straight to dimmed) -GHS
         Well then, see you next week.
//HACK out the fade, to zoomed antenna (slow fade), ADV mode -GHS
I ended the broadcast.
Stand up, switch off the power.
Time to tidy up I haven't.
I must absolutely go to the hokora,
and repeat this once again.
This act may just be futile, I have no idea.
But I will continue to call out,
I will seek a moment of intersection, a temporary crossing in my heart,
//How would he do that if there were truly no one? -GHS
throughout a number of weeks that will transcend all count.
For the sake of proclaiming "see you next week".
///Or, "the memories of bustling people", but see CCC3004: bustling goes IN the memories to be a Person. -GHS
//Lit. "embrace this rusting world", but sabitsuku, much like rusting, also has this meaning of fading away. Total is 25 lines, of course. -GHS
