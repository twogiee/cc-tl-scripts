After suitably passing time in the club room, I'm on my way back to the classroom.
A maiden was crouching in a corridor devoid of human presence.
//Pun not as obvious in English I'm afraid. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is everything well, ojou-san?"
//Formal. -GHS

I extended my hand towards her behind.

[Girl]
"Woh'tt'ooo!"

In a display of explosive force, the girl stood straight up,
and gained distance with a suri-ashi.
//Specific judo technique, that is the correct English term. This is pretty clever for Miki, but still not Unreset clever. -GHS
She's quick to transition into combat readiness.
And, simultaneously with her springing up, she inflicted an attack on me.
//Rag below. Still sharp enough to mask some of her later behavior. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...nice one there, very nice."

[Girl]
"Same to you, Senpai."

The rag that she threw towards my face fell from the one hand I had caught it with to the floor, in silence.
//See CCD5001. This is a move he learned from Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Been a while, hasn't it. 9, no, almost 10 hours now?"
//HACK this was changed in the console version to make it less as if Taichi is remembering the loop, also specifying current hour and time since last meeting, which should've been around midnight since the "loop" begins at that time. -GHS

[Girl]
"It has."

This girl so like the heroine of that famous fantasy novel adapted to the big screen stands up.
//I sooo wanted this not to be Hermione from Harry Potter, if only because first film is from 2001 and would mess up the dating in a way that would force me to consider that Taichi would only have read the book, despite it having been released in the US the damn same month the VN takes place in and the translation to Japanese being Dec 1999, which admittedly is one of the earliest translations... but CCZDXC confirms it. Personality-wise, it does fit in many ways, especially that part near the end of book 3. If it helps, Wikipedia reports that Hermione was named from Shakespeare, further cementing things. What Johnson has to do, however, I still only have the vaguest idea. -GHS
Be at ease. That's just her looks.
//Actually, Hermione does fit the Genius Loli archetype nearly to a tee. Or she would if she weren't surrounded by people the same age. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Would it be strange if I said that we haven't met in a long enough while that I forgot your name and the like?"

[Girl]
"Naaah."
//Think about it for a second: Miki'd have no problem with Taichi forgetting even her name. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, but be at ease..."
[Taichi]
"Johnson."

[Girl]
"At least use a girl's name."
//As for the reference itself, no one in the Harry Potter cast is named "Johnson", so that looks like a dead end; maybe the Johnson & Johnson baby shampoo, with its iconic yellow color - see CCA0027 for Coppertone, so it's not alone. This *may* be a reference to Robert Johnson, see CCC3002. This would fit as an early-bird spoiler. The only other I can think of is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Johnson_Kiriakis (notice the KIRIakis, so very Japanese-sounding though it isn't), given the Adrian/Adrienne vs. Alien, see CCZAS. But that's really really reaching. -GHS

A face one could say had had enough of being thought foreign.
//Ah, there we get deep into the Nations of the World metaphor. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You've improved your skills, Miki."
//More ambiguity: Miki already seems better than she should be. At this point it should just be trickery, but since there's no certainty that this is the very first week, it's not impossible that with the above lack of surprise at the memory loss, that Miki already knows Taichi has "reset", and therefore is not quite aware of all that he taught her in the weeks before. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yep."

Yamanobe Miki stuck out a chest so unplentiful it invites tears.
//See CCA0009B: she DOES have boobs that he doesn't expect. This loli flatness vanishes around Kiri's route, never to return. -GHS

[Miki]
"Because my behind is valuable."
//Not yet "because I hold myself precious", but suspiciously close. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Although I managed just to graze it."

[Miki]
"Fanservice."
//Going with technical term due to imitative behavior. -GHS

Unperturbed.

[Taichi]
"But until I flip that skirt..."

[Miki]
"You shan't flip. (Decisevely)"
//... (silence) -GHS

Not bad.
Bluffs are no longer effective, then?
//See Mi(yu)ki. Those were largely threats. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But it's fine. For this once, I'll let you carry the flowers so that you can take credit for this."
//Literal and lateral due to overlap with the nickname. -GHS

[Miki]
"Eheh!"

She smiled brightly.
Waaah, hug meee!
//Supposing he wants to be held back. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Watcha doing? Playing cleaning lady?"

[Miki]
"Ah, yes, things are a bit dirty lately."
[Miki]
"Me, ah' like 'em clean."
//Dagnabbit. Supposing the dirty words and dirty thoughts, not so much the dirty corridor. Though if it IS Kiri's blood due to her period... -GHS

She flexes an Imaginary bicep.
//NOT the bicep polishing gesture, as far as GIS claims. -GHS

[Taichi]
"All of your own initiative, that is very cool yes!"
[Taichi]
"...ahhh, I get it, I get it, say nothing further my sweet! There's no way, it's about my autograph, right? You desire the autograph of this Ijuin Taichi here. You've merely engaged in the good manners typical of our chosen career path and made a demand in ways roundabout."
//Should be a reference to the typical Japanese way to neeever ask (or say) anything directly. "Our" career path would be them being teacher and pupil. Still going with this as shouganai due to CCX0001. http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BC%8A%E9%9B%86%E9%99%A2%E5%85%89 wait he has twitters too? K. http://twitter.com/HikaruIjuin See CCC3004 for possible origins of this. -GHS

[Miki]
"...ahh, yeah... that one, yes."
//Ah, this scene is unclear. -GHSoHelpful
[Miki]
"Really been a long while there."

She makes a face that looks very pained.
Or should I say, isn't she as if about to cry?
Or should I say, isn't she as if about to cry?
I even thought that twice dammit.
Getting flustered is a no go, cope with this with composure.
Like an elite cadet of young adulthood who is experienced in the ways of the world, having tasted both its bitter and its sweet!
//Boy this will return. Literal and lateral because uhmmm science. -GHScience

[Taichi]
"Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what is wrong, Yamanobe-kun?! If that is so disagreeable, than I shall not even think to wast that blank space! I proclaim this with honesty, see?!"
//Blank space of the notebook I guess. -GHS

My voice just shakes.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, she's crying, ahWahWah!"
//It may be because she's annoyed at how many damn times she's done this in previous weeks outside the loop; but it may be that she is, genuinely, sad that this hasn't happened in a while and simply doesn't understand how to correctly express this emotion. In this sense, she's just like Taichi. -GHS

She wipes the corners of her eyes,
which carries me to tearfulness as well.

[Miki]
"Ah, no, it's nothing, SAH!"
[Miki]
"It's just that my lachrymal glands leaked some adolescent juice..."
//Ê±Å juice, it's a crying cross. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoa..."

Adolescent juice then.

[Taichi]
"Don't scare me then."
//He's absolutely unfazed by the nonsense that is "eyes leaking adolescent juice". He doesn't seem to understand the point of tears at all. -GHS

I wiped off cold sweat.

[Taichi]
"Well then, this time the Autograph of the Prince (me) is postponed."

[Miki]
"NO!"

A shriek as if her throat was hoarse.

[Miki]
"I need you in this! Do this please!"
//"I need it" + "put it in" & "please do it" + "please do me". This is another overreaction; Miki just doesn't seem capable of taking things in proper measure, which is why he takes Taichi's Settei so damn seriously. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Y, you want this done to you that badly?"
//Still puns. -GHS

Faltering from my direction.

[Miki]
"Do this please! Do this please!"
//Same as above. -GHS

I'm repeatedly called to "do this please" with a shrill voice.
The lower abdomen grew hotter.
//See CCD0021, it's probably the clearest. -GHS
But why, really?
For what reason, even?
Why must the erectile tissue of this innocent young boy ignore my volition and just rage---
//Adapted boku again, see CCD4003 for more (you know you want). -GHS
I may have thought this in the tone of a fairy-tale, but the graphicness didn't go away.
//see CCA0007. Break out that On Fairy-Tales essay! -GHS

[Taichi]
"I-, I got that, well then 'that' I'll do."
//Break out that "On 'that' I'll do" essay! -GHS

[Miki]
"Here!"
//Break out that "On Here" essay! -GHS

Miki groped about her perpendicular chest, then produced her MateBook.
//CURSED YE SHALL BE WITH THE CLIFFENING!!! -AkihaTohno -GHS
So it is called at this school, this ID booklet with a second role.
Yes.
No dignitary of this school would be unaware of the existence of MateBook, the high-class bathhouse #1 in popularity located in the popular spot behind the main City's train station.
//This will be one of the weirdest running gags in the VN. The MateBook will be repeatedly said to be named (or not) after a possible whorehouse, SoapLand or public bathhouse. The origin will change pretty much every time. The point, of course, is that this is part of Taichi's Settei and its origin changing constantly and without warning is the reading key to watch out for other things to. Clarified as it's not necessarily obvious in English that being behind the train station is a popular spot, not a seedy one. -GHS
A notebook is given on gaining membership, and for every use a Princess Stamp is received.
//Can't source the euphemism, if it even is one. See CCC0000: Ichiko would of course leave a princess stamp... -GHS
The accumulation of stamps is the measure of how cheaply one can enjoy services such as the Double or the Triple.
...what's even a triple now.
//See CCC4007, though there's another in CCD3003B. -GHS
What kind of world would be that?
Would it be Shangri-la?
//"A permanently happy land, isolated from the outside world", reminds Wikipedia. IOW, endless sex with Miki and Kiri in this Cross World. Remember that extra scene in Kagetsu Tohya, Flower of Thanatos? That's all that needs to be said then. -GHS
And is the sun yellow?
//This was an odd mystery in Cross Channel: sun miswritten as Â§ßÈôΩ instead of Â§™ÈôΩ. This was used nearly systematically with only two exceptions in the original script; all the ones that still appear in the all-ages version (ie not this one) have been fixed, so it was just a strange typo. -GHS
I have erected...
This is bad!
If I take a gentle forwards Shift here, Miki will notice.
Miki might be a literal maiden, but she is acquainted with male physiology,
because I explained it to her.
Even if I don't lean I'll likely be spotted, but if I stay confident, I should at least look cool.
//No, that's never cool you damn unrepentant beta. -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

Ah, she glimpsed right then.
Miki's face goes fairly red.
She says nothing.
She turns her gaze towards the outside via the window, and fidgets slightly.
//Is she embarrassed or horny? -GHS
Wah, this is even more embarrassing! Say something!
//The damn M. -GHS
Please make sport of me with words instead!
But the embarrasment is so great that this savage god of destruction grows subdued.
//Of course there's a god in here. -GHS
As a consequence of a lack of combat experience, perhaps, direct confrontation is a weakness.
//His dick and Miki both. Remember, she's a Witch of Words. -GHS
Directassment prohibited.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
* Directassment = Taichian for the Direct
  Performance of Sex-related Harassment.
  Mainly, infantile acts of obscenity such as
  exposing one's genitalia and making a person
  of the opposite gender touch it.
  Imitation chonmage, self-destruct button,
  fishing with a pole, et cetera. Depending on
  the situation, these could end up being
  considered molestation.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Or should I say that they all are flawlessly unquestionably molestation.

[Taichi]
"You've been using this notebook thoroughly, Miki. It's all worn!"

[Miki]
"All worn."
//Will return. -GHS

Miki assents by meaninglessly repeating my words.
//See CCD4002B -GHS
Flipping the pages, I see annotation fields filled with my large-sized signature.
//No one else's, meaning it's their game. -GHS
I pass by several pages.
It's as if she were collecting my signatures.
Or, to be precise, this is me making her collect them.
//Possibly either. It's their game. -GHS
I find a blank page and there I fill out a fresh signature.

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"You know, this little game of ours here was just because I wanted to put my autograph on your chest padding... not because of mean intent, OK?"
//Oh dear. Word itself means "practice with a sparring partner of higher skill", with the implication of imitative behavior; this form means "to have a contest with you"/"challenge you"; and literally it's "borrowed your chest". All necessary. Left vague, because it is after all. -GHS

[Miki]
"I'm telling you I didn't dislike it."

[Taichi]
"You-, don't?"

I finished writing my signature.
//fucking kanji amirite amirite -GHS
Miki was making a tranquil face.
There's certainly not a whiff of pretense of having disliked it.
//This is basically screaming the reading key for the Misato scenes, that 'wind' needs to be read 'pretense'. -GHS
I quickly check out the rest of the pages.

[Miki]
"Ah, I don't really write my dating plans or anything there."
//It's not her World Domination plans, either. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah well."

I return the notebook.
She holds it against a chest so like the bottom of a slipper.

[Miki]
"Please be at ease. Miki most certainly is still a virgi„Äún!"
//This is so funnier in the console version where we are reassured that Miki is a girl. Wow, she's not a trap? -GHS

[Taichi]
"It-, it's not like you need to reassure me of such things!"
//Intentional -GHS

Flustered, I regress to childhood.
//He just wrote the blandest tsundere line ever and then called it childish, I just love this stuff. I'm adapting those blatantly badly written lines as parodies of generic bad VN translations, if it's not clear. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes, yes, I do understand."
