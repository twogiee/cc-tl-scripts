A faint smile.
I am controlled by a mischievous heart.
//Automatism. -GHS
Quietly I approach from behind.
I kill my presence.
Without making one sound, slowly.
Well then, where will you notice me now.
Maybe I will soon make one sound from her behind.
One step. Again one step.
Kiri does not appear to be sensing me.
If I embrace her as this is... I will have beaten her.
It will be possible to prevent the entirety of Kiri's resistance.
It will not take one minute to make her lose senses.
And then---

[Taichi]
"......"

Suddenly,
//Also å¤ª -GHS
I become aware that I have been pushed to act by hideous carnal desires.
What is going on is... not to be.
It would hurt Kiri.

[Taichi]
"......"

One step, I move back.
Without making one sound.
Move back, move back, to my original position.
And there Kiri turned around.
She notices my figure at the entrance and startles.

[Taichi]
"Heeey."

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu... senpai."

A mood of mutual enmity drifts in.

[Taichi]
"Yeppy yep. This your Kurosu-senpai, Kiri-chin!"

[Kiri]
"...your business?"

[Taichi]
"None!"

She points to the entrance with a sharp motion.

[Kiri]
"Please leave. We have no requirement of you either."
//"We" due to Miki, even if she's not in yet she'd totally include her, and reflexively so. -GHS
