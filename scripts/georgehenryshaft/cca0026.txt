[Taichi]
"Ah, right!"
[Taichi]
"Senpai, wait here just a moment, please."

[Misato]
"Yes?"

I go,
and come back.
I hold up what I was grasping in both hands.
//-.-' -GHS

[Taichi]
"Handmade popsicles!"

[Misato]
"Wah, that is amazing!"

I hand one over.

[Misato]
"This tastes like the ultimate resourcefulness of mankind!"
//Or their latent power, but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh, to put it in yet insolent other words, it is that of this Kurosu Taichi here, indeed!"
//...can you read this as anything but "it tastes like my sperm"? -GHS

[Misato]
"So cooold, deliciooous!♪"
//Though it's 99.9% the opposite. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mankind banzaaai!"

[Misato]
"Banzaaai!"

Super Popsicle Uproar.
//Only on Kyuppachi, though soon to be ported to the 100 Mega Shock! -GHS

[Misato]
"What did you use as ingredients?"

[Taichi]
"Lemon, sugar, white of eggs."
[Taichi]
"...and this harmless young boy's adorable two hundred million little Wonderful Lives."

Senpai comes to a halt.
For unknown reasons, her glasses suddenly fog up.

[Misato]
"......"

The very ambiance broadcast danger.

[Taichi]
"Uhm, of course that was a joke."

[Misato]
"...please exchange this with yours."

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes."

[Misato]
"If you keep saying tiresome stuff of this kind I will have no alternative but to give you a good punishment."
//That word includes spanking. See CCA0013, I guess. -GHS

So she says without the most damnable hint of emotive inflection.
Incredibly scary.

[Taichi]
"I-, I shall pay most thorough attention from now on!"

[Misato]
"...seriously."

Her fogged-up glasses suddenly clear out.
//Mirrors above. -GHS
Is it voluntary?
But by what mechanism even?
Frightening.
//HACK music starts just a sentence later -GHS
However, in counterbalance to the risk there is a result:
!!INDIRECT KISS!!
//ONLY CAPS CAN CONTAIN IT -GHS
And furthermore, because it's a popsicle, it's a sticky wet, deep indirect kiss.
Carefully and deliberately I enjoyed myself with this, yes.
//Girly. See CCA0015 -GHS

[Misato]
"I came here for some offer of gratitude, but I received a tasty treat in return!"
//Cough cough cooough. Someone had impure intentions. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh, naaah, what you mean! Please do not fall in love with me so easily!"

[Misato]
"Thank you for the food, Peke-kun. I have not fallen in love with you."
//Of course. She was in love with him long ago. -GHS

Hopeless.

[Misato]
"That made me feel all cool and refreshed."

[Taichi]
"Because every day is so hot, right."

[Misato]
"Hot indeed."

[Taichi]
"Well, it is Summer, what ways are there, none."

[Misato]
"...but I do want to go the beach."

Senpai looked outside of the window.
That sea that should be farther ahead is, in the darkness, invisible.
//It should be possible to see the sea, or a bit of it, from Taichi's house. His room's window should be towards the front of the house, and the front of the house is north towards the sea. IMO the wipes make it look like he moves right, rather than left, towards the school but that's the map. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's go!"

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Let's meet up tomorrow, in front of the school, at noon."

[Misato]
"Ehhh?"

[Taichi]
"I will call everyone, of course."

[Misato]
"B-, but today is already tomorrow..."
//Here's a random discussion whether it's 今日の明日 "today's tomorrow" or 明日の今日 "tomorrow's today" instead (in Japanese): http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/3345596.html -GHS

[Taichi]
"I shall make do somehow!"

Thumbs up.

[Misato]
"But say... Kiri-san, or Hasekura-san, will they come?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, those guys demand ingenuity."
//Begin Walls of Nietzscheianisms... why would Youko demand clever scheme? -GHS
[Taichi]
"The mediocre masses require no good faith to get into motion. Striking at their weaknesses is enough. Wahahah."

[Misato]
"...I would like for you not to say things that horrible with a face that invigorated."
//See CCB0005. This is another thing that seems to get Fixed. -GHS
[Misato]
"Ah, but I might not fit into last year's swimsuit anymore."

[Taichi]
"EH?!"

[Misato]
"It-, it is not because I got fatter!"

[Taichi]
"Eeeh, in other words you grew as in towards adulthood, is that what you mean?"

[Misato]
"It is."
[Misato]
"It really is, OK?"

[Taichi]
"Nah, there are no real doubts about those parts."
//Ambiguous. -GHS

So her boobies are still getting big~ger.
My thoughts boioioing into a gallop towards wild delusions about Senpai's bust.
//Powaru = http://ts.revinx.net/project/dic/crossc.htm "to have wild delusions" but given powa-powa, putting it like this. What, you are actually asking me what in the sentence allows me to double the 'powa'? Do I have to draw it for you... (.)(.) there you go. -GHS

[Misato]
"...!"

As if sensing some kind of maliciousness, she hides the midriff with both hands.

[Misato]
"Sooo that is why a swimsuit would be..."
//"...impossible to procure because that would be stealing (mankind's nonexistence regardless)"? Except, she doesn't have a problem with stealing, see CCC3016. More likely that she doesn't want to go buy one at Atomic Goods, or maybe they don't have her measures. -GHS

[Taichi]
"One of these?"

[Misato]
"You have all theeeeese?!"

[Taichi]
"The standard string bikini perhaps?"
//#3 from the left -GHS

[Misato]
"Whyyyyyyyyy do you have all these?!?"
//Counting the letters in the last word (rU, nO), that's 14 held letters so far. -GHS

[Taichi]
"With size 86 C cup, this should be right."
//8+6= 7x2. But if C=3, 17 1+7=8 -GHS

[Misato]
"Hyh?!"

[Taichi]
"String and Seashells of Shameless Ocean Paradise, how about it?"
//#2 from the left -GHS

[Misato]
"That gets a no!!!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, then this! Pearl White Bombshell Bikini!"
//#4 from the left. Similar, but not quite the same one she'll wear in CCD1001. Suspecting a design inconsistency, though. -GHS

[Misato]
"This? But this is transparent even before you get it wet..."

[Taichi]
"Here's an odd one, Ropeless Crest Swimsuit, yes!"
//#1 from the left. Is that from Resident Evil? -GHS

[Misato]
"These are just pasties only on the front side are they not!!! Are you stupid!!!"

[Taichi]
"How about this most daring one? The part around the chest is transparent vinyl as to lead to a performance equivalent to toplessness..."

[Misato]
"I-, I will be defiled!"
//This recurs. Obviously. -GHS

Senpai covered her face.

[Taichi]
"Next we have a Women's Fundoshi."

[Misato]
"Whyyy would I wear that and nothing else!!!"

[Taichi]
"This comes most recommended! A test of human intellect: Naked Summer Queen, a swimsuits that idiots cannot see!"

[Misato]
"That is just going nudist is it not!"
[Misato]
"That is vetoed! Veto veto veto vetooo!!!"
