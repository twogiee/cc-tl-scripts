[Miki]
"Ah, Senpaaai!"
//HACK doll later -GHS

[Taichi]
"Howsit."

A random encounter with Miki leaning against the wall, idling.
The impression that I got from looking at Miki was that she was not particularly shocked by all this.
But it's probably her just acting like that.

[Taichi]
"Have you been eating properly?"

[Miki]
"Sah! Thanks to club, somehow."

[Taichi]
"...that one more club innit."

[Miki]
"Yes."

[Formal name]
Life Maintenance and Improvement Club.
//vs. 生存部 = Survival Club & whatever Taichi decides to call it today. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Kiri-chin's also a member there, right."

[Miki]
"Yes. A splendid one."

[Taichi]
"Indeed, splendid."

[Miki]
"Very strange that you are not participating, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Ngh, c'mon you. Kiri-chin and me, we---"

And on talking about her, Kiri-chin came out of the toilet.
//HACK Kiri and Miki at the same time -GHS

[Taichi]
"Did you flush?"
//Remember, no running water. -GHS

[Miki]
"Th-th-th-th-that's the forbidden question!?"
//HACK doll here, still Miki onscreen -GHS

Gryyyt.
Kiri seems to have a bit of bruxism.
//Most vexing, verily. *tweaks monocle* -GHSnob

[Kiri]
"...KUROSU TAICHI!"
//HACK less flustered Miki -GHS

No honorifics then?
And treated like a sworn enemy as well?
//HACK doll position 2 -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

A frosty look was turned towards me.
Ever unchanging Kiri, always in the same way she was.
Ease up a little!

[Taichi]
"Kiri, as always such a lovely skin you have."
//Skin very likely not meant just literally. -GHS

I extend a finger.
//HACK shocked Miki (these is a rare script where these non-directly cued changes don't look like obvious bugs) -GHS

[Kiri]
"Please do not touch me!"

The back of her hand supplely shoots me down.
ShiverShiverShiverShiver!

[Taichi]
"...nice."
//HACK Kiri doll position 2 -GHS

[Kiri]
"...huh?"

[Taichi]
"Nothin'."

I sweep my bangs.
//HACK less happy Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"AhWahWah, quarreling is no go!"

[Taichi]
"I would never do something as uncivilized as quarreling."
[Taichi]
"I would prefer something more refined, like a duel."
//HACK Kiri doll position 2, shocked Miki -GHS

[Kiri]
"...do you mean to provoke me into a game, Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed. It is a Duel of the Night."
//Poor Miki, originally stuck in this position through the scene... -GHS

[Miki]
"Blush."
//HACK Kiri doll position 2 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Let's go, Miki!"
//HACK out with them -GHS

Kiri pulled Miki's arm and spun on her heels.

[Taichi]
"Go let's go, apologies for the intrusion, yes!"

I line up.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
The three of them really go well together.
//Sudden third person. -GHS
Three gay sisters that remind of rapeseed blossoms!
//If this wasn't intended, well, it is too good to pass up anyway. Even creepier considering Taichi's backstory. -GHS
And this is the story of these three girls, a beautiful tale of love!♪
//HACK restore screen -GHS
...not even clooose.
//HACK Kiri returns -GHS

[Kiri]
"Senpai..."

[Taichi]
"Aw, I was noticed!♪"

[Kiri]
"The only one who has not noticed is Senpai with his lightweight brain matter."
//See CCA0002 -GHS

[Taichi]
"But it's gray you know."
//HACK Kiri doll position 2 -GHS

[Kiri]
"But unless I speak candidly you do not understand, it seems."

[Taichi]
"Wahah."

Kiri did not laugh.

[Kiri]
"...thoughtlessly optimistic even in this situation I see."

[Taichi]
"Naaah, now, please, not all that praise. You want me to go all red in the face?"
//As usual, he sounds like he's ridiculing her, whether he intends it or not. -GHS

[Kiri]
"..."
[Kiri]
"But I know, and well. Therefore."

[Taichi]
"Whaet?"
//{}? -GHS

[Kiri]
"Therefore I have no intention of letting my guard down."
//HACK out with Kiri -GHS

The two take their leave.

[Taichi]
"...sigh."

Really now.
Too much... tension in this air.
I call out towards the backs of both.

[Taichi]
"Heyyy, you two!"

Stops in her tracks and turns around, however, Miki alone.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

Fumbling for the right words.

[Taichi]
"Be thoroughly careful with your physical conditions!"

A refuge in safety.
Certainly, as we are cut off from civilization now, managing physical condition is paramount.
Miki gave a vigorous salute, Kiri shed but a peeking glance.
