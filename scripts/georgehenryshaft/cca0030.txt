                And then, Sunday.
//Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS
Rooftop.
All preparations are in order.

[Taichi]
"Thank you for your hard work."

[Misato]
"...you too, Peke-kun."

Senpai was a bit... absent,
//It also literally reads "botlike". -GHS
therefore, I proclaimed this:

[Taichi]
"We are not finished yet!"

[Misato]
"...we are not?"

[Taichi]
"This Broadcast Channel must always be subject to improvement."
//Paraphrasis: "dinnae be depress'd ya wee lass, woak be not ovah!" -GHSuddenlyScottish

[Misato]
"..."
[Misato]
"It will."

[Taichi]
"At your discretion."

[Misato]
"Yes!"

Handshake.
//Or clasped hands...? -GHS
Senpai had gathered and set aside all equipment, so that we can look up at the antenna.

[Misato]
"Broadcast capable, yes we are!"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Misato]
"We may broadcast now, but that does not necessarily mean everything will go well because of that."

I think so as well,
but this won't be meaningless.
Because this has been only a want to move and nothing more.
If one does not have something to do, the balance of the heart can just never be attained.
I am, myself, like that.
However, my motive is a little different from everyone else's---

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, did you manage with that script?"

[Taichi]
"Ye-, yes, let us say..."

In truth, not at all.
Senpai smiles brightly.

[Misato]
"Then, you will take the role of the DJ, please."

[Taichi]
"I?"
//That was waaaaaay intentional. -GHS

[Misato]
"We have no time to make an aircheck right now, nor do we have spare time to have retakes."
//I think she means this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircheck -GHS
[Misato]
"I leave this to you!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, huh."

On the contrary, this may just be expedient.
After all, this script is sort of almost entirely blank.
I'd have to come up with a suitable cover story otherwise.

[Tomoki]
"Taichiii, can you help me carry some of the equipment?"
//As with the constant talk about mucous membranes, this thing about 'equipment' is always so oddly unspecific. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Okkieh!"

Having finally turned up, Tomoki glances towards Senpai.

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

The gazes become divergent.
There isn't the same sharp thorniness of before.
For now that is enough.
Because after this, no matter what, they are going to have to be living face-to-face.
We have nothing but time. Enough to grow disgusted of it.
After that, we transported equipment,
so as to be monitoring from the rooftop.
//Not actual PC Monitors, as usual. -GHS
The goal of this plan was for the very first broadcast to be a live report from the rooftop.
//Conveniently, because that means they don't need to set things up to the actual broadcast room. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Damn that Sack, even at times like this did he have to be a stupidly cheerful slacker!"

[Tomoki]
"...didn't he just start?"
//Unclear, but it sounds like Tomoki actually knew he was there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right. That numskull!"

[Sakuraba]
"Damn straight."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"..."

[Taichi]
"G'wah! Sakuraba! Why are you here?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Friendship demands---"

[Taichi]
"Nothing in return."

Tahm!
We laughed fearlessly as we stuck our thumbs up.

[Tomoki]
"Nah, yer using that wrong."
//That 'iya' sounds like it was (mis?)cut. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Been a while, Sack."

[Sakuraba]
"Indeed."

[Touko]
"...yuck, the three stooges."

[Taichi]
"Oh!"

Touko and the rest have come.
The rest!
Behind her were Miki and Kiri both.

[Miki]
"GWOOO-D MOOO-NIIIN-G!"

She rose both hands energetically and shouted.
To that loud voice Kiri furrows her brows and shrugs.
There was a scene there,
titled The Usual of Seven People,
that should have been lost.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, what is this...?"

Senpai repeatedly tugged at an edge of my clothes.

[Taichi]
"Welll, I made a deal or so."

[Misato]
"A deal... but, Peke-kun, but...?"

[Taichi]
"For I am the Supah Directah, and that is my success!"
//screw it *chug* -GHS

[Misato]
"..."

Senpai made a tearful face.
She had no words for about a minute.
And finally,

[Misato]
"A whole club assembly, then."

[Taichi]
"HAI, BUCHOU!"

/screw it *chug* -GHS
A whole club assembly.
Will there be an opportunity like it after this?
No, improving on this union from here on out will be enough!
//Should recall line about 'broadcast channel'. -GHS
...just kiddin'.
That is something I cannot do.
//Notice that he knows he can't do it. He learned his lesson. And then he'll forget it. -GHS
Therefore,
because this is only the now,
I will make it into a memory.

[Taichi]
"Attention!"

Raising one hand, I call attention to everyone.

[Taichi]
"Well then, to celebrate the re-gathering of the Broadcast Club, we shall after this re-assault a bakery."
//re- in both cases. Hum, so they did this once? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"What even for?"

[Sakuraba]
"I thought we would, so I came prepared to eat curry bread."

[Tomoki]
"Don't toss lies around!"

[Misato]
"A bakery, do you mean that place run by that ex-Yakuza in disgrace*? Can us seven even triumph over him?"

* = Tasaki Shop
//See CCA0004 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't you give this serious thought as well."

[Tomoki]
"But really, being all here, 's been a while."

[Touko]
"...whyyy are you even looking at me!"
//I suspect this is Tomoki... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Because you're a traitorous bastard who never ever comes to club."
//...and by Tomoki's signature 'traitor' he seems to be quoting. Interactions between Tomoki and Touko are more unique than rare. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't you say that."

[Tomoki]
"Don't you say that."

Two High Bloodshed Power Single Fist Straight Man Ripostes (literal meaning) strike with a time lag.
//Tsukkomi does have a violent meaning beyond the more usual comedic one (plus at least a sexual one, like every other word in Japanese). -GHS
Sakuraba sinks wordlessly.
By the way, the division of characterizational labor of this three-man team ended up becoming:
//See CCA0007 -GHS
Sakuraba = Boke        (silly guy)
Tomoki   = Tsukkomi    (straight man)
Taichi   = All-rounder
//Tried making it fit, but in the end, it doesn't work. It's all in two lines above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I shall be the one to disentangle her heart. With the power of love!"
//As it'll start soon becoming obvious, this script is obviously composed of scenes more or less elegantly stitched together. Maybe it's just Taichi dreaming (<- fanwanking). -GHS

[Touko]
"Don't you hug me!"

[Tomoki]
"...don't her voice seem to be seriously saying no?"
//See CCA0012 -GHS

[Taichi]
"But her body here has evidence!"

[Touko]
"Go stand in a fire!"
//Lit. "go boil", but 煮 = 火 fire + 者 person ergo SCIENCE! -GHS

Her Elbow Strikes go thunk-thunk as they contact my head but I don't care.
//Doesn't match picture. -GHS

[Miki]
"Kirihara-senpai!"

Miki hugged Touko's butt.
//See CCC3004. Imitative behavior GO! -GHS

[Touko]
"UWYH?!"

She makes a high octave scream.
Miki thoroughly rubs her butt.
//Doesn't match picture either. -GHS

[Touko]
"You-, not you too Yamanobe!"
//Too many Ys. -GHS

[Miki]
"So soft... so way too soft..."
//Hum, but in CCC3004 it was bony. And she's totally starving, still. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kirihara, only your looks are the best!"
//See CCA0018B, interesting. -GHS

Touko's face cramps up.

[Touko]
"Let me go! Don't touch me!"

[Miki]
"Senpaaa〜i!"

[Tomoki]
"Mass sexual harassment innit."

[Sakuraba]
"Yah."

[Touko]
"Don't just look, do something!"

[Sakuraba]
"Neutrality in civilian affairs, ma'am."
//Official Japanese police policy. Unsure if there's an official translation of the term. -GHS

[Touko]
"You the police?!"

[Misato]
"Kirihara-san, have your physical conditions improved now?"
//Likely asking about how she had been fainting. This flows with the scene sooo well, doesn't it. -GHS

[Touko]
"Before you start a normal conversation, do something about these two monkeys!"

[Misato]
"But those poor things are living on instinct, there is nothing we can do to change that."

[Touko]
"You're even saying that all calmly... eEH, where do you think you're touching me?!"
[Touko]
"Ah, yAhn, wha... really stop iiit!"

Out come the tears.

[Taichi]
"Ah..."

[Miki]
"Ah..."

Confused, we release her.
//See CCC0009B. Miki's totally only stopping because Taichi does. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Sob!"

[Taichi]
"What are you even crying for!"

[Sakuraba]
"But isn't Kirihara crying too?"
//I guess this is a hint to the imitative behavior above. See CCD0002, CCC3022: nice, huh. -GHS

[Miki]
"The weeps are contagious!"

[Sakuraba]
"Hyper heartrending!"

[Tomoki]
"Natural Raw (Natural airhead as Raw materials) innhe."
//http://ts.revinx.net/project/dic/crossc.htm confirms that TenSo is a portmanteu of Tennen Sozai, Natural Materials (but the 'natural' also means 'airhead', used around Sakuraba back in CCA0002 for example). Not sure why there isn't a * interjection, maybe because, like everything Tomoki, it's sort of obvious and lame. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Anyway, sorry Kirihara."

[Touko]
"......aren't you... stupid..."

I was smacked in the back with the flat of a hand.

[Taichi]
"Owwwie!"

It hurt like it was a whip.
//It's... too late, yeah. But see CCA0002. -GHS
Well, just desserts isn't it...

[Kiri]
"...sigh."

Kiri disdainfully turned away and exhaled a sigh.

[Taichi]
"Here, I'll give you candy."

[Touko]
"...do not want."
//Screw it, it's not like we don't have literal catspeak anyway. -GHS

Grabbing her chin, I cram the candy down her throat. Fingers and all.

[Touko]
"MMMMH?!"

[Taichi]
"Have a taste, it's like your mommy used to make!"
//Pseudo-recurring. Made it into some kind of ad slogan, I think it's intended (if it's not a parody of one that I can't source). Literal is "you should eat mother's flavor", but written sorta bookishly/old-fashioned. Actually a lot creepier considering the 'mom' is Youko. -GHS

She wants to escape, but I catch her chin tight and don't let her gain distance.

[Touko]
"Nh... nMh, nh, hrhruh...!"

[Taichi]
"And ooone, and twooo... weeell, how many will this adorable hole be able to take, nooo〜 one knows!"

[Touko]
"Nnh, nMuh, nnh, nh... hfhuh... nh..."
//Why isn't this counted as a sex scene? -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you disliked this, you could just bite the fingers you know?"
//See CCE0001. Indeed, when it comes to food, her body has evidence. This is why I believe CCA0012 was intended to be about force-feeding, not rape. It's gangrape used as allegory for eating food instead of letting oneself die, not viceversa. This thing is just so classy. -GHS

There is a faint animosity in her vacantly open eyes,
but, as I churn her oral cavity, entwining and pulling on tongue, her eyelids shut tightly.
Seems Touko is very sensitive on the inside of the mouth.

[Taichi]
"And threee, and fooour... mwah hah hah hah, take this and this and thiiis!"
//I'll actually be keeping the 'sora's later, but only because they match voice and they sound wrong otherwise. -GHS

I push down to the root, utterly trampling it down.
//Totally a sex scene. -GHS

[Touko]
"NmKh, nh, hrhuh... nFhuh, nnnh... 〜〜〜!!!"

[Taichi]
"Mwah hah hah, sweet is this not?"

[Misato]
"AwahWahWahWah!"

[Miki]
"ERO-Y ERO-Y ESSAIM ERO-Y ERO-Y ESSAIM..."
//Claims to be medieval, but of course it's Napoleonic era at best. Seems to be famous due to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makai_Tensho and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akuma-kun though the latest references are Hayate the Combat Butler, but that's 2004 at the earliest. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Ta-, Taichin! That is a bad thing to do, it's way too dirty! (infantilized)"
//I added Taichin, but it's too good to resist. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Th-, that's why... this person is dangerous... I'm always..."

[Sakuraba]
"To me it's part of a Give-Me-Candy, nothing more."
//Odd sentence this. Don't think he's rating him. -GHS

Excluding one person, all members were quivering and shaking.
//All members excluding him and Touko, I guess. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mwah hah hah... eh?!"

My intent of apology turned into bullying?!

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry, sorry."

I set her free.
With a sqlick I remove the fingers, dragging out strings of saliva.

[Touko]
"...nh, ahn..."

Staggering, Touko gains distance.

[Taichi]
"Weeell anyway, sugar intake means you can go living energetically."

[Touko]
"Haaah, haaah..."

She was disoriented for a while, but on return to her senses, she gives me an audibly sharp glare,
while her mouth is filled to the brim with candy, like a squirrel.
//See CCB2010. -GHS

[Touko]
"...stupid... shtupid Taichiii!"
//Mouth full. Very much not that angry, nope. -GHS

[Miki]
"No talk back there!"
//Both sides. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

[Kiri]
"...bunch of children."
//I know, 集団 is translated differently above. Oh well. -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes, yes, recreation extends no further than this!"

Clap-clap claps Senpai.

[Touko]
"...wasn't recreaSHion... sexual harassHment..."
//Sweatdrop Touko removed because it makes no sense here. -GHS

And her words just fall through.

[Misato]
"Sakura-san, Kirihara-san."

She calls out to the two estranged ones.

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Misato]
"We have gone to so much effort, how about letting us be together one more time?"
//Console version has a closed-eyes Kiri responding to the wrong line. Fun fun fun fixing the bugs in two different versions. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

[Misato]
"We call these Club Activities but there is little hard work, so how about killing some time by just looking on?"

Kiri and Touko...
Two gazes that were made to loosely cross each other.
Where each of those two stands is subtly and individually different.
//Physically, mentally, in society, from each other... -GHS

[Kiri]
"I have..."
[Kiri]
"I have come only because Miki called me."

[Misato]
"Is that a no?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin..."

[Kiri]
"...I will be accompanying Kiri until she leaves, no more."

[Miki]
"A-ha!"

The mood relieved. One half of it only.
//See CCC3012A. Except there, the first level is [Y]ouko and the second Kiri. -GHS
This other half, however, is still stopped in a still grimace.
//Intentionally intentional -GHS
She holds down with a hand her mouth stuffed with candy and spins words.

[Touko]
"I only came in becausHe HasHekura-sHenpai told me to come!"
//See CCA0027. Same thing, still. -GHS
[Touko]
"But... it doesHn't look like she'sH here, sHo..."

She goes to leave.
I grab her arm.

[Taichi]
"Uhm, that'd be me."
//Can't you just picture him giggling like a maniac as he writes lines like these... -GHS

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Because I thought if I used my name, nooo way you would come..."
//Indeed. Just his own name. But on the postcard, whose writing was it...? -GHS

[Touko]
"Leaving."

[Taichi]
"Wait, wait!"

[Touko]
"If you called me then I wouldn't have come in the first place!"
//Mouth not full on this one? Great direction, guys. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha be so angry!"

[Touko]
"Alllways doing this, acting conveniently for yourself! Like back then!"
//Their parting, I'd guess. -GHS
[Touko]
"You have fun mocking people and making them look stupid, treating them just like toys, don't you! How about thinking at least a little about the feelings of others?! It's annoying that you think that people don't get hurt just because you never get hurt yourself!!!"
//This one gets split in the console version, but I managed to keep it somehow. Indeed, although harder to see than should've been, Taichi does treat people like things. He certainly sticks words in their mouths like they were but puppets. And in the end, what's stuff like the beginning of CCX0001 but turning people into his toys? -GHS

[Miki]
"It's a quarry..."

* Quarry = Mikian for Lover's Quarrel.

[Tomoki]
"Won't this stop?"

[Sakuraba]
"That is a request for candy, Taichi."
//Indeed, all her whining and preening and moaning, but she just wants to be pushed down and defiled. She's more M than he is. -GHS

[Misato]
"You are always the same, Sakuraba-kun."

[Kiri]
"It feels like this will continue until the President stops it."

[Misato]
"I-, I guess."
//Touko reacting to the wrong line in the console version also not brought over. -GHS
[Misato]
"Uhm..."
[Misato]
"Stop iiit!"

[Touko]
"○&□%▽x◇＄＃!!!!!!"
//Uhm, circle and square % inverted square * rhomboid equals... pfhor? -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Effect visible is 0."
//SYMBOLISM!!! for the situation doesn't progress ergo circle ergo time loop. Also it's people talking different languages see CCZAS ergo SYMBOLISM!!! again. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ngh..."

No good. Seems I'll have to settle this on my own power.

[Taichi]
"Touko."

[Touko]
"What now!"

[Taichi]
"I really love your angry face."

[Touko]
"What... is that supposed to mean?"

[Taichi]
"Therefore, can we have the these friendly fights from now on, how about?"

[Touko]
"............"

And Touko gives a long despondent sigh.

[Touko]
"...whatever. I'm tired."
//Yeah, totally. Definitely not her not minding this. And totally not the author being unable to find ways to make this flow better, cough cough this script really reads cobbled together cough cough. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Did you get all that?"

[Touko]
"I told you I'm tired. Can we just hurry and begin activities?"

[Taichi]
"Just don't leave!"

[Touko]
"...do whatever you want."

Asserted and understood.
I take her by the hand to where everyone is.
//Metaphorical and physical, again. -GHS
Touko, still hanging her head, did not say anything.
//Moved a sentence later. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Commander, by one mean or by another, the restoration of that ordinary that was lost has met with success!"

[Misato]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Er, rather, it may be all cobbled together but I have finished mending these human relationships."

[Misato]
"Ah, huh."

Not a fully satisfied face.
//See CCA0011A -GHS
Of course. Because those girls still have their own personal differences in viewpoints.
//I can't read this as anything but a creepy "because they are still individuals". Maybe intentional. -GHS

[Misato]
"Anyway, it has been a long while since we have been full force."
//Notice the lack of concern for Youko? And later on... contradiction! -GHS

[Taichi]
"IESSAH."

The mood with seven people is so nostalgic.
Club activities had begun.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, do you mind if we leave things to you?"
//After mucous membranes and equipment, we have these mysterious unspecific 'preparations'. I can't seriously think of this as some sort of gag. This is also contradicted after the toilet scene. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, leave it to me!"
[Taichi]
"But before that, I have to go to the toilet for the small one."

[Touko]
"Shut up and go, dummy!"

[Taichi]
"Fiii-ine."

I will help her to more harassment afterwards.

[Sakuraba]
"Were you just refreshed by a harass of thoughts about later harassment?"
//HARASUmento + ki wo HARASU. -GHS

[Taichi]
"T-, thinking that far's weird!"
[Taichi]
"Wheeew."

So in retaliation I used the women's toilet, neh.
//Still trying to get Taichi to sound girly at times like this. Unfortunately, English is not collaborating even after repeatedly smacking it with a pipe wrench and sticking bamboo shoots under the fingernails. But if violence doesn't work then there's nothing that can! -GHS
And the stall that Touko always uses, too.
//Is that the same one Kiri will use? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hoooh hoh hoh!"
//Noblewoman's laugh? Going with that. -GHS

Elated in my triumph, I wash my hands with the water in the basin.
//Term implies the water itself may or may not be running. The real problem is the stalls (yuck!) -GHS
In the mirror she was reflected.
//Possibly intended to be Touko on start. Instead it's Tou--, Youko. Close enough. -GHS
Hands stop.

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan?"
//See CCA0001. This is a coincidence in the same way that the sevens and eights are. -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"So you came to school, didn't you. Just like always, an elusive phantom."
//This'll be a bit of her nickname. Term has kanji for 'god' and 'demon' in it. -GHS

[Youko]
"Pretend-a-club, having fun?"

I did not think there would be any reply, which surprised me.
//Of course it would. It's just himself. Split personalities aren't supposed to answer. But is she one? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...but this isn't pretend-a-club, this is club."

[Youko]
"But... it has no meaning."

[Taichi]
"'s no such thing."
[Taichi]
"There's practical meaning. For my sake, and for everyone's sake as well."
//Taisou is both 'exaggerated' and 'calisthenics'. Given CCA0020/CCB0018, I suspect the pun is intentional. -GHS

I smile.
Yes, club activities are truly worthwhile.

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Who's even got a personality capable of staying still at home here!"
//Both of them, really. It's why True Solitude is unachievable by Taichi, and why what he sees of that in her is false. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Well, did you come here just to make that sarcastic remark?"

[Youko]
"Sarcastically... I didn't mean it that way..."

Voice wilts.

[Taichi]
"You went so far as to wear the uniform."
//Part budget saving, part because school's in session. And part because Taichi is wearing it, so she has to as well. -GHS
[Taichi]
"You went to all that effort, you participating?"

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"This is club! We're gonna broadcast right after this."

[Youko]
"Those are toys, they can do nothing."
//Equipment and the people. And given it's all about the message, VNs in general. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Of course it's just for a mere temporary peace of mind."
//Notice he's basically trying to convince himself this is worth it? -GHS

[Youko]
"That is meaningless."

[Taichi]
"There's meaning in the peace of mind."

[Youko]
"...I decline."

[Taichi]
"What if I hugged you while begging you to participate?"

[Youko]
"Will go."

That was simple.

[Taichi]
"..." (pondering)
//What SEKUHARA-DESU to give-desu her-desu -GHS-desu-desu
[Taichi]
"What if I pestered you to give me the panties you are wearing now?"
//Odd he'd ask, isn't it? Let's say it's a demonstration. -GHS

She puts her hands under her skirt.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, I knew it, donnn't!"
//See below for specific type of frustration he's having here. -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

She stops all motions.
What am I now, the protagonist of a platform hell game?
//鬼畜ゲーム Kichiku geemu, lit. Brute Game. Sounds like it's a porn game, doesn't it? Instead, top representative is I Wanna Be The Guy and all games of that style. Given she's quick to obey his orders and he has to be quick to stop her, platform hell actually makes more sense than hardcore porn. ...annnd there goes another one of those sentences. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well... keeping your distance is fine, just look in. You're a misanthrope after all, aren't you."

[Youko]
"Not hate mine... just disinterest."
//Don't forget your etymologies now. hmmm that starts with the same letters as EThanol for some reason. I knew it! It's about aliens! -GHS

So she says, dispassionate.
It might not seem like it, but she's using all her strength to force herself to talk.
When it comes to other people, she occasionally doesn't tell even the most necessary of things.
//This actually uses the 'proclaim' kanji. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But this has been an Event hard to organize, so how about we just participate together?"
//vs. her just staying afar and looking on? Maybe her previous assent was just sarcastic. -GHS

[Youko]
"...mh."

With a tiny nod, she left the toilet.

[Taichi]
"But still..."

I had gone into the girls' toilet, but how quick she noticed...
//As if she was always there with him. -GHS
What else from our Super Kunoichi.
I leave the toilet.

[Taichi]
"By the way, did you know that if you disassemble the kanji for Woman, you can get the 'ku', 'no', and 'ichi' to make kunoichi? They're hiragana, katakana and kanji respectively, tho."
//Curse, double curse, and triple curse the lack of kanji display. 女 = く+ノ+一. But also a point here is that it's written くの + 一, as the last one's kanji and is just like Taichi's name. -GHS

[Miki]
"First I've heard. So,"

Our path cross but don't meet as she goes inside the toilet.
//See CCD5001, same term furry'd after the "for the sake of..." bit. IOW: SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhm... me going in the girls' toilet you keep a secret, OK?"

I clung to her.

[Miki]
"Wooon't I nooow, whaaat should I dooo..."

[Taichi]
"Just not to Kirihara, really."

[Miki]
"Sooo, telling Kiri-chin is all right then?"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, that's also baaa〜d!"

They are the two most pre-emenint cold-blooded females at this school of ours, are they not?
//Only in their tsun part I guess. -GHS

[Miki]
"Miki wants to eat Nata de Cocooo!"

[Taichi]
"Is-, is some Agar to your liking instead?"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar OK, I can't look at that chemical structure without seeing an orgy, I've officially been at this too long. -GHS

[Miki]
"Well then, seems this mouth here will be opening and go all Pepe le Pew with wooo〜rds!"
//Seems to be just a cutesy variation on perapera (fluent, talkative), but it sounds like Pepe le Pew was mixed in to that so here's another unsound effect for the pile. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Have mercy!"
[Taichi]
"Hello hello."

[Misato]
"We juuu〜st managed to set up everything!"
//I'm suspecting she told him to get stuff ready, then he basically skipped and came back just in time for everything ready. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then it's time for Ultra Super Charismatic Broadcast Club Member Kurosu to DJ!"
//lit. just "ultra super charismatic DJ", tweaked for below. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Super-'Member', to say it in a word..."
//Super-goose. Goose as in 'glans', that is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"S'yah!"

Rear Mawashi Geri.
//http://f.hatena.ne.jp/gryphon/20091016034346 That IS the correct English name. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"G'fuh!"

[Taichi]
"You don't go saying that stuff in front of our wencheees!"
//Overly familiar/derogatory term. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Everybody knows that one already."
//Unclear. "It's so old that joke that everyone's heard it"? Maybe it connects to that derogative term above. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"...pain beyond reason."
//See CCA0002 -GHS

Sakuraba can take lots of punishment, so he didn't have much of a reply.

[Misato]
"Okaaay, that third rate sketch ends there, so let us begin on the double!"
//Considering a consistent translation of 'とっとと' (see CCA0029) ... ... ... reconsidered. -GHS

[Trio]
"YE-ES!"
//Funny story, this was changed to 'duo' as, well, Taichi doesn't talk. Maybe same reason the 'duo' line was removed in the cafeteria? Oddly, the line is assigned to Sakuraba alone. -GHS

Lethargically the male troupe begins to move.
Kiri stood a bit apart, watching all of us attentively.
Solitary as she is, in Miki's absence she seems bored.

[Taichi]
"Hey!"

Kiri had no reply and merely faced away,
stomping a heel, frustrated.
Dear dear...

[Miki]
"Back!"
//...omata??? Doesn't seem that appropriate here. -GHS

Miki returns.
Extremely naturally she goes to stand next to Kiri.
Those two...
Kiri looks and acts very much like a guardian, and that is fact, Miki is important to her.
The truth was that their relationship was the complete opposite of that visible from an outsider.
That composition, that felt of dominance,
was in my heart as a morass of chatter.
//These three are pretty ambiguous, I suppose they only explain that Miki's in control here. -GHS
But right now I've got to think about the broadcast.
This script is no more than an introduction.
//How long before the rest was this first week written? -GHS
Speaking of not-quite-things, Youko-chan's profile is nowhere to be seen.
As she said she would join in, I expect her to be somewhere.
I search.
Within the radius of 20 meters, there are only six things moving with some vigor.
//6+2+0=8. The specificity of things hints that other things are moving, but given CCX0001 also says the sun, it may be just a Week 1 troll. -GHS
Just beyond that there's a vague sense of physical discomfort.
//This term means "a moral or physical disturbance at seeing something that mismatches". It will be used to describe Nanaka, as well as Youko and more, hinting that what's being seen may not be actually there. -GHS
The water tower.

[Taichi]
"There she was."

As I should've thought, that is to say, she was lurking on top of the water tower.
//Seems like ninjas like that spot. -GHS
A tiny silhouette, just barely moving.
//But the water tower isn't that high, it's barely taller than the antenna whether it's above the stairs or not. She should be clearly visible from there. Either Taichi's pretending she's harder to see than she is, or Youko is either nonexistant or no larger than an actual physical doll. -GHS
It's her.
Her motion is no more than a mere stir,
but if there is even just the smallest of movements, I can tell.
In this insipid and dull world, my senses had become sharper than anyone's.
//"I don't sparkle in the sun, but my hair being all white allows me the supernatural power to dodge heatstroke!" -GHS

[Taichi]
"Really uninterested, innit."

[Tomoki]
"Eh? What?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, I wasn't talking to you, Tomoki."
[Taichi]
"Sooo broadcast, to broadcast."

[Miki]
"Does this broadcast even have some kind of name?"

[Misato]
"Hmmm, we have not settled on one, no."

[Sakuraba]
"Ma'am!"

[Misato]
"Go on, Sakuraba-kun."

[Sakuraba]
"Hell and Dismay Broadcast Relay."
//Doesn't seem to be a specific reference...? -GHS

[Misato]
"E'hy!"

B'guh.
The President Punch sank into Sakuraba.

[Misato]
"Vetoooed. Anything else?"

[Sakuraba]
"Hurts, yes〜."

[Tomoki]
"You are really an idiot yannow."

[Sakuraba]
"But but, doesn't that one have an impact?"
//Well, the hell part's there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's do like machine guns and just fire off some suitable ones."
//See CCA0015 -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Yah."

[Taichi]
"Super Ninja."
//Why would he want to call this VN after Youko? -GHS

[Misato]
"..."
//Doesn't seem a reaction, more like she can't come up with anything. -GHS

[Miki]
"Bushido of the Sexual Harasser."

[Sakuraba]
"Licentiousness of the Betwitching Flock of Beauties 〜Author: Yumem***a Baku〜"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Yumemakura One of the kanji is wrong, but it's 漠 vs 獏, may be a typo; however, this Baku here can also be read Hiroshi, Sakuraba's name, so may be intentional. The style of that author doesn't seem to lean towards the nukige, so... "his works are influenced by outdoor interests such as fishing, particularly Ayu fishing", hmmm. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Broadcast bu."

Looks like the trend has been completely dictated by that first one.
//Nukige name? Nukige name? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Super Ninja."

[Miki]
"Kenneth Broadcast Channel!"
//Kurukurupa originally a much worse word http://japan-cc.com/slang.htm http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/2664417.html Since it refers to insanity, that's probably the real reason why it's so chastised here. Replaced with something appropriate. -GHS

All members in the proximity of her location poked Miki in manners businesslike and clerical.

[Miki]
"OwChCh... meeniesh..."
//Intentional -GHS

[Misato]
"Imprudences forbidden."

[Miki]
"Apowlogies..."
//...though it's more like "I won't make any", but Artistic License. -GHS

Back to square one.

[Taichi]
"Super Ninja."

[Tomoki]
"That's getting a lot of votes ain't it..."

[Sakuraba]
"What sort of Ninja's that."
//Anti-demon from the way this is going. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorta like Hyper Super, Mega Future..."

I explain via gesticulation.
//Very Misato-ish, this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"A ninja that in a single jump can, say, clear a wall around ten meters tall. Then, with Favored Sword * Kogarashimaru, woosh-wooshing---"
//Around "cross" meters tall. 木枯丸 Kogarashimaru seems to be from Tale of the Heike, and has a sister sword in Kogarasumaru, not sure, and not much more information unfortunately. Since the term means "cold wintry wind", I suspect it's just a vague reference to Touko, who will have an actual sword. More Youko<->Touko referencing, then. Unsure what the correct English term, if any, for one's favored sword is, and unfortunately it'll return for the abovementioned Demonic Bread Harakiri (may be curry-based). -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Slays the wicked magistrate?"

That's hackneyed and boring!

[Taichi]
"Nah."
[Taichi]
"Slays a girl raised in the town."
//All these are of course gender ambiguous, but it's obviously Youko. She's even literally referred as a Super Ninja in CCA0027 (but a Super Kunoichi above, because Tanaka's a bastard like that). -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That's a psychopath!"

[Sakuraba]
"...psychopath."
//Proposal. And now see CCA0001. -GHS

[Misato]
"Veto."

[Tomoki]
"Give it some elaboration!"
//Could be to either. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Difficult."

[Misato]
"Distance yourselves from that negative direction pleeease."
//Probably both negativity and, uhm, 'weird stuff'. -GHS

So Senpai screamed via megaphone (which she had).
//Never mentioned before or ever again. Can't see puns, so this should be the extent of the joke. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah!"
[Taichi]
"Mimimi-senpai's peach pink G-spot."
//See CCD1001B. Because even this needs to play a part in things. -GHS

[Misato]
"S'yah!"

B'guh.
Punched.
A beautiful Straight Punch to the Midsection it was.

[Taichi]
"Oh'fh!"

[Misato]
"Vulgarities are not to be, is that clear?"

[Taichi]
"AYE!"

[Sakuraba]
"Let's make the Flowers the DJs."

[Taichi]
"EEEH?!?"

[Miki]
"I'll have to try asking Kiri-chin!"

[Taichi]
"Bu-, but, wait..."

[Sakuraba]
"Girls are a must have."
//Tough words from Mr. Yaoi here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh."

I get it, but...
...I do have regrets.

[Miki]
"Then well then!"

She ran over.

[Miki]
"---"

[Kiri]
"---"

She came back.

[Miki]
"'Save the sleeptalk for when you're dead, you black porgy assholes', she said."

[Sakuraba]
"Hu! ...as always, firm of hand."
//The 'hu' laugh will return. -GHS

Sakuraba wiggled and swayed, looking very happy. Because he's a masochist.
//Look who's talking. -GHS

[Taichi]
"A porgy, what's that?"
//He doesn't know this. It's very interesting he wouldn't. -GHS

[Misato]
"It is the Japanese Black Porgy. It is a Tai with this weird face."
//http://www.savoryjapan.com/ingredients/fish.html#Tai it's also one of the most popular fishes for game hunting in Japan. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Weird face?"

[Misato]
"Sooort of like this:"
//This thing was so lo-res it was nearly unreadable, and that was the 800x600 graphics! For some reason, the 360 version is no bigger than that, and completely unreadable on the screen. Fortunately all the specific terms are sort of on the Wikipedia page. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How daaare you, Kiri! You better pay close attention to your chastity when walking the streets at night!"
//Of course, see CCA0022 and CCB2009: Taichi is not a Porgy, he's a Trout! ...wait a second porgys trouts KINOKO NASUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-GHS

[Kiri]
"...(pfui)"

[Taichi]
"MokYYYYY, that puss!!!"

[Tomoki]
"Come on, come on!"
//Not CP above, dammit. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Me somewhat tired now."
//He's all but officially a chimpanzee anyway. -GHS

[Misato]
"You are one to say..."

Expectably, a feeling of war-weariness had begun to hang in the air.
//"I dunno how to proceed with the scene!" too much letting the mood write the story here, man. -GHS
This is but an intermingling of petite failures of character, after all.

[Taichi]
"Right! Kirihara, your opinion?"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"As far as it goes you're a club member, aren't you, so say something you curtana!"
//Sword + bitch. Curt-ana is a valid alternate spelling of Cortana, which is good because Halo references here are a bit lacking. (Cortana is now a Halo reference FOREVER, by the way.) (also ana is hole fnarr^2) -GHS

[Touko]
"Hmph!"

She snorts, seeming annoyed.

[Touko]
"...o-baka-chan-tachi (The Idiots)"
//Proposal. Literal is Baka's (sic). -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"I take offense to that last one! How dare you ridicule others as idiots just because your social class is of the somewhat wealthy!"
//High class twit. This is another thing that gets used in CCX0001. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You're the same."

[Taichi]
"You're the same."

Same time and same style of riposte (literal meaning) sinks Sakuraba to the mat.
//stop spanking the monkey dammit -GHS

[Tomoki]
"And anyway, you're stupid because you have money don't you. So stay like that."

[Sakuraba]
"...pologi's...
//Intentional -GHS

[Taichi]
"Certainly this guy's an idiot, but that proposal is unacceptable, Kirihara."

[Touko]
"...TSUUUN."
//It-, it's not like I'm translating this literally because I'm laz--- wait -GHS

[Miki]
"Doesn't look like we'll settle on anything does it."

[Taichi]
"Your opinion, Senpai?"

[Misato]
"...does seem unlikely."

She probably thought it was time to give up on entrusting this to the conglomerate of idiots.
Senpai folded her arms and mulled it over.

[Misato]
"If Peke-kun is the DJ... Kurosu Channel."

[Sakuraba]
"Simplistic."

[Taichi]
"But also the most decent."

[Miki]
"Also, it including the name of that guy that I so like is Ultra Kyute!"
[Miki]
"...or so Kiri-chin murmured hot and bothered in my ear."
//...she's trying for a save on her de-facto confession, doesn't she. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I didn't say that!!!"

Kiri's angry at a distance.

[Taichi]
"Dammit, hiding your true thoughts and finding me moe! You're challenged to a date, Sakura Kiri, you bastard!!!"

[Kiri]
"I did NOT say that!!!"

[Tomoki]
"That aside... instead of Kurosu, Cross is better isn't it?"

[Misato]
"Ah, you mean the English word?"

Addressed by Senpai, Tomoki goes flustered instantly.

[Tomoki]
"...well."

[Misato]
"Cross Channel is it? Yes, I like it."
//Notice they're both English now. -GHS

Mixed feelings remain on his face.

[Tomoki]
"Well, that's nice isn't it..."

[Misato]
"What do you think, Peke-kun?"

[Taichi]
"The use of this worthless servant's appellation as prefix is something to be extremely and humbly delighted of."

[Sakuraba]
"Wait."

[Taichi]
"What is it now, Camerata Muttsolini! Surely there is no secret plot within you to mutt-er a most morose complaint to this wonderful naming?"
//Backing away veeery slooowly here. But I suppose if we'll have Mein Third Reich, might's well have him. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Not Cross Channel, but Cross†Channel is better." (reading does not change)
//It's commented out, but I assume that's just a writing oversight, that's obviously part of the line. Also, this is Sakuraba's most explicit contribution to the storyline: adding the actual Christian Cross to the story. It doesn't get much blunter, frankly.. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I don't get him... seriously, this guy I just don't get him..."

[Taichi]
"Niiice that one."

[Tomoki]
"Do you even get that?!"

[Sakuraba]
"Confidence: present."

[Taichi]
"I can concede that it's a nice idea, for you at least."

It's decided:
Gunjou Institute Broadcast Station Cross†Channel has officially been inaugurated.

[Taichi]
"Well then Tomoki, it's to broadcasting! Put some fire into that boiler!"
//They should be using dynamite. ...of course they'd have some, it's post-apocalyptic Japan, the only thing odd here is how they're not drowning in the ammunition and medkits that they will find in every locker. They're certainly drowning in crossbows and bolts. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"No such thing."

[Sakuraba]
"Full starboard."

[Tomoki]
"This a ship?"

For some reason, Tomoki's straight man replies were all businesslike.

[Touko]
"Idiotrio."

An irritated muttering.

[Taichi]
"If it wasn't for the dumb, then this would've been less than a complete club gathering wouldn't it."
//Seems like a subtle insult. -GHS

[Touko]
"?"

[Misato]
"Being really all here... it would be great if we were."
//Now isn't this odd. -GHS

A great ball of gloom leaves Senpai by the mouth with a 'hoh'.

[Taichi]
"By the way, Kirihara, you went the effort to come here so do get all wet because of this flowing speech I'm gonna make, OK?"

[Touko]
"...extradummy."

Directing herself in the other direction, Touko keeps tossing candy in her mouth.
//So now she has reserves? -GHS
Crunch-crunch she chews down.

[Taichi]
"Embarrassed?"

I peer into her face, coming from below. Distance between her lips and mine: five centimeters.

[Touko]
"KIYOOOOOOOOH?!"

Touko fused "KYAAAH!" and "NOOO!" in an innovative scream, and smacked her fist into a person's face.
//That's oddly impersonal. Less odd when considering this is where the sunset coming for the loop is hidden (or not), meaning the strangeness is intentional. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, do we begin?"

[Miki]
"So very lucky for us that this is not a media that transmits images."
//Trolllllllll -GHS

[Taichi]
"Damn if we aren't."

There's no way we could show the aftermath of that punch.
//Of course not. It'd spoil that this scene doesn't take place hours after the last one but just moments after the time loop starts... or viceversa, that the time loop is just Taichi having fixed this event in his memories, and therefore joining Sunday morning with Sunday evening in his Settei as herald of the Loop Event that is just his self-selected removal of his memories. Or pretension thereof. -GHS
I sit in front of the prepared microphone.
A nice evening breeze.
//Damnably, the bluffing returns. -GHS
It gently sweeps the rooftop, scraping away the leftover warmth.
//And the enthusiasm. -GHS
Tension rises.
I send a glance towards Youko-chan, my thumb raised.

[Youko]
"..."

She immediately returns me a thumbs up.

[Misato]
"...Hasekura... san?"

The President alone saw, and noticed, this exchange.
//How convenient! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yess'sah."
[Taichi]
"All members are present."
//Interesting he points this out AFTER he's been smacked and technically knocked out, isn't it. -GHS

[Misato]
"Peke-kun... you...?

[Taichi]
"Surely this is pretend-a-club, no mistake."

Insubstantial,
lazy,
full of deceits about which absolutely nothing can be done about.

[Taichi]
"But at this time, at this very moment, this is what is needed."

[Misato]
"..."

Senpai stiffened, standing stock still in the spot.

[Misato]
"But, I am just..."
[Misato]
"For a reason that sacred...!"
//Very unclear what this part means. Probably about how this should just be flight for her, but she's recognizing it isn't so for him. May have something to do with Youko's "presence" screwing things up. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I said it's fine, that's something that sounds very like a true intent."
[Taichi]
"Club activities with everyone. There, that is all."

[Misato]
"I..."

All members are here assembled.
Everyone is right here.
//Emphasis on 'living' and 'individuality' (kokoni means "here" and "separately one by one") -GHS
It doesn't simply mean that all of the Broadcast Members are assembled.
It's the wreckage of intimate friendships, created over a number of lies and deceits.
And for us who live in this world that will become a tiny elongation of our lifespan, of the limit before the downfall of our hearts.

[Tomoki]
"All right, Taichi!"

[Miki]
"6 o'clock in 5, 4..."
//-7' to loop. This is a very important reading key. How does Miki know it's six o'clock, when the evening on Sunday means it's 11:31 and the loop is coming? Also 5+4=9, 6+9 = 15 = 7+8. -GHS

Miki closes her mouth, and decreases the fingers one by one.
3.
I was dreaming.
/２。
2.
About this kind of silly innocent club activities, about an ordinary life as if an ordinary student.
1.
//6 o'clock +5+4+3+2+1=7x3. -GHS
As long as there are memories, I will be fine with that.
Zero.
//Here comes the loop. -GHS
I will be satisfied---
Draw in a breath,
release the script from the grasp,
and an evening wind that still captured that scent of Summer kidnaps it with a mischievous sleight of hand.
//see CCX0001, this needs to work with or without the script line. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah?"

The manuscript pages took flight, one by one, and in pieces disordered they scattered and spread in the air.
So, to broadcast.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club."

Even if I understand its futility,
I will cling tightly to it, and live on.
And then, I pushed out these forceful words:
/Are there people still living out there?
///STRONG focus on the living part. As Living is actually the eternal, Christian life post-life, then this is also a call to Christians the world over. Certainly a prayer, in more than a sense. -GHS
CALL ndemo0001
