[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

I should really go with her, shouldn't I.

[Taichi]
"...gentleness, innit."

Men are gentle.
//Different from CCA001A -GHS
Lies are also gentle.

[Kiri]
"...?"

Kiri was among us.

[Taichi]
"Heeey!"

[Kiri]
"!!!"

She's petulant.
Damn crotchety virgin!
//fnarr fnarr "crotch" -GHS
Kiri is way too excessively virgin.

[Taichi]
"Where're you going?"

[Kiri]
"...none... of your business."

She leaves at a brisk walk.
I follow behind at a brisk walk.
My stride is large,
so I caught up effortlessly.

[Taichi]
"Going to link up with Miki?"

[Kiri]
"Please do not follow me."

[Taichi]
"I got something to do with her too."

[Kiri]
"...!"

Quick march.

[Taichi]
"〜♪"
//I arbitrarily changed this to a reference to this unknown nukige known as Cross Channel. -GHS

Quick march for me, too. Whistling.

[Kiri]
"......!"

Pace going up.
Closing in.

[Kiri]
"...really!"

Kiri bursts into a sprint.
Reflexively, my body moves.
Tag chase.
//追い駆ける (pursue)+追いかけっこ (play tag). See CCZAS, where the same is done to Misato. -GHS
We pass through the shopping street.
Ain't the hill road just ahead!

[Kiri]
"Stay away!"

[Taichi]
"Why are you running away!"

[Kiri]
"Because you are chasing me, Senpai!"

[Taichi]
"Because you are running away!"
//Should be a variant of the more usual "joke" (painfully bad even by Japanese standards of bad joke, and that's saying something) that includes mostly the first two lines. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Do not follow meee!"

I wiiill!!!

[Taichi]
"I have, been, forged by, these, hills but, how will, you survive, you bastard!"
//See CCA0004. Hopefully a comma communist somewhere saw the screenshot of this and died. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hah, hah, hah... haaah."

Hoh hoh hoh.
Pooped already are you?
//screw it *chug* -GHS
And then, because of how my hair turned white overnight due to terror, there's how I am very resistant to sunlight.
//See CCX1001, CCA0012. Since his flashbacks say he had white hair throughout, this is more evidence of exactly how he remembers. The wham lines were the throwaway ones all along. -GHS
I would call that a Hyper Advantage.
We cross over the hills.
One hill,
//hey japens if ur so cool whyyy don't hills get ther counter? -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hah, hah, hah!"

two hills,

[Taichi]
"HohHohHoh."
//Maybe laughing, maybe tired. -GHS

three hills,
and Kiri's speed fell.
Chaaanche!

[Taichi]
"Getcha getchaaa!"

[Kiri]
"...back oooff!"

Grrr, she has unexpected reserve power.
//See CCA0026? -GHS
It seemed this would become a drawn-out battle.

[Taichi]
"Here we have my hooouse!"
//tour guide? -GHS

[Kiri]
"SHUT UP!"

We run past.
Our course runs in circles through the back streets and returns to the school.

[Taichi]
"Gw'ooh!"

The chastity belt was chafing.
It hurts!
Too much to even think about sexual harassment!
Nevertheless sexual harassment!

[Taichi]
"You think this'll be a neck and neck!"

Fighting spirit was boiling.

[Taichi]
"HohHoh!"
[Taichi]
"HohHoh!"
[Taichi]
"HohHoh!"

School INNN!
//Gakkou in <-> Gakuin (institute). -GHS

[Taichi]
"HohHoh!"

Without switching shoes GOOO!
And like that to the Second Years' classroom.
//In the console version, this is the Harakiri Wolf, see CCB0004C: it seems they didn't add the SFX, the just replaced this with that one. This is true in both PS2 and 360 version. Good job as usual! -GHS
Slam!
//Unfortunately the term is now overtaken by some music group or something that I can't be arsed to look closer at. Wondering if it's a corruption of ズダーン. -GHS
I opened the door Kiri had shut and fly inside,
just as as she was leaving out of the classroom's rear door.

[Taichi]
"Tsk!"

I run through.
//Hum, too different meaning to leave it copypasta'd. Damn. -GHS

[Touko]
"...wEh?!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, she's not here!"

Left or right which way did she vanish!

[Taichi]
"...sniff, sniff."
[Taichi]
"This way!"

Florality from the right.
I run down the stairs.
First floor corridor.
//So the second years are on the second floor. The first and third on the third? This makes no sense. -GHS
Kiri's back came into sight.

[Taichi]
"Mwahaha, little one, your Floral Mint shall end your liiiiiife!"
//Pretty sure Tanaka at least knows the other meaning of 'mint'... though see CCA0013, and the new CCB0013. Hum, mint diaries... and later on, Citrus Mint. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Tsk!"

Once more to the outdoors.
Incidentally we've been running for around an hour now.
//It's ~63 lines from the start of the chase. Hmmm, 1 line a minute? Interesting -GHS
For this! Is! Summer!

[Taichi]
"HohHoh!"

[Miki]
"...ah, Senpai..."

As if I were the mere afterimage of one of the white train station nameplates that occasionally go by the window of the midnight express that a broken-hearted Empress Michiko took while on a journey of grief, I dash by Miki.
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9A%87%E5%90%8E%E7%BE%8E%E6%99%BA%E5%AD%90 see CCC4022, the nickname for Empress Michiko (who has the same 'beauty' kanji as Miki) will also be used to refer to Miki in a lavish banquet of Mickey Mouse/Empress Michiko/Miki House onanism (it beats FUCKING HERMIONE FUCK). -GHS

[Miki]
"Hohcch'oh!"
//暑い atsui hot？ ...no, it can't be, it's not Accio, is it? No, that's アクシオ (akushio, not hoacchoo). Whew. -GHS

A voice from the rear.

[Taichi]
"!!!"

And impact.
Scurrryyy!
//In the sense of scuttle and scampering -GHSoUnhelpful
Faces sliding.

[Miki]
"Knee lap attack * Hiza Kakkun!"
//Hey, it googles! -GHS
[Miki]
"Ahahahahaha!"

[Taichi]
"Ahahahahaha!"
[Taichi]
"...H'ryah!"

I kissed, as if I were a Kiss Thief.
//TL note: a Kiss Thief steals kisses[citation needed]. -GHS

[Miki]
"NMHUH〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜?!?!?"

Drill.
//See CCC3010. This is revenge! -GHS

[Miki]
"Nh, nBh, nh, pWah?!"

Vibrate.

[Miki]
"Nh, NNNNNh, pch, pchrh, nBhah, nh, 〜〜〜〜!, nh, nHnHhth... hrh, hfah, nnNNNNH!!!"

Vacuum.

[Miki]
"nMhMhMhMhMh, hFah, hfAahnh, nh, nNNNh, nHo, b-, breathe, can't breathe... nnnn〜〜〜〜〜h, h, hrhuh, hruhuh, npch, chphruh, ah, aGhkh, haoh, fmUUUUhnh!!!"

Finishing blow is the Mik'sser (given it's Miki)
//Miki-mixer + Miki-kisser. Curiously, Taichi here has FOUR settings, not two. So does he actually have a Violent Murderer and a Youko setting? -GHS

[Miki]
"Nnh, nNNNh, nh, uhnh, nhnh, nhuuh... hrhuh, ...ah, no, hfah... tongue, nh, ghkh... caaan't, nooo, nnnnh, NNNNNNNNh, nh, hruh... fAh..."
[Miki]
"Pain, it's just... release me... rel... nnnNNNNNN〜〜〜〜〜hhhhhh!"

She collapses with a pomf and fell to her knees.
//Assuming that's another non-joyo SFX. Curses! -GHS

[Miki]
"...fhWhyuuu〜 ...AhfhAhfh..."

[Taichi]
"Hiza kakkun."
//See. -GHS

So I arrogantly proclaimed.
Tracking pursuit resumes.
But really, dammit Miki.
Grabbing the knees of runners!
As this time today, you have experienced rapid growth to adulthood.

[Miki]
"...hfyh, fyyrst kiiiiiss..."

That is the voice I heard from the back.
Reaping the whirlwind indeed.

[Taichi]
"HohHoh!"

Having sucked in some energy I go out all hyped.
Kiri still managed to get some distance but...
On this one hill, I shall regain it in a single gulp.
Dassh'u!
//Assuming it's a Melty Blood reference, see CCD2002 for another. -GHS
However, as the situation finds me equipped with a chastity belt, I am endowed with a most thorough bowlegged stance.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, you think you can give me the slip with just thaaat!"

[Kiri]
"...nggghhh..."

Surprisingly, she falls forwards.
//Her Woman Running Away from Monster Timer must be up. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ngh, ngh... sigh... sob!"

She was on the point of tears.
//-de beso -GHS

[Kiri]
"Stop, enough..."

Considerably fatigued,
she runs as if dragging her feet along, in a limp.
To overtaking... perhaps ten seconds.
And once I overtake, what do I do.
I did not think about it.
//See CCA0020. What does a dog do after he catches a car? -GHS
Nothing to do but entrust it to the flow of emotions.
The Double Pillage of the Flowers' First Kiss---
//See CCC3008. He already stole her first kiss. See CCD3003: interesting now. -GHS
Wicked thoughts.
Indeed. That one's good.
I shall make a bedlam of scattering the Flowers.
//See CCA0025C. Just because I can. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kuh kuh kuh!"
//Evil laugh -GHS

By now Kiri is practically walking, and I lay my hands on her.
That split instant,
a shadow at the edge of my field of vision.
I concentrate on the instant. I see it in slow motion.
//See CCC3022. The two scenes are nearly identical, but one has Youko and the other Nanaka. Very interesting comparison. -GHS
What is this?
A bicycle.
A bicycle, but,

[Nanaka]
"YAAAAAAAH!"

[Taichi]
"Goh'aaah?!"
//Goh'aaah Screaming Show? -GHS

I was smacked into the ground.
Awareness dilutes.
Kiri grows distant.
//No, no, you're confusing Kiri with Kasumi. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Seriously... this boy... just wasting all his strength, without even going to the hokora..."

Grumble, grumble she muttered.
............
When I was awake, I was in my room.

[Taichi]
"Uh-, ugggh..."

[Miki]
"Good morning."
//...doesn't seem to be the next day, however. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, Miki-rin."

[Miki]
"This is Miki-rin. Sorry for intruding."

[Taichi]
"Eh, what?"

My crotch leaves me unsatisfied.
I try to touch, and that reliable faint sense of pain that was the feeling of the chastity belt is no more.
Petit loneliness.
//Hey, just like Sakuraba's impotence... and if Taichi's monster is his dick... -GHS
I shared sorrow and joy with it, wouldn't it obvious that I'd grow into some measure of attachment?

[Taichi]
"Miki... this is sudden, but, the thing I was wearing..."

[Miki]
"And what an amaaazing thing you were wearing!"

[Taichi]
"Hi-, High-Tech Briefs they were."

I lied.

[Miki]
"A-, assuriiin'...?"
//It sounds like it's for "sugoi" with a "ka" for questioning, but "sugo" alone means "protection, safeguard". And this being Hermione of Words, therefore thSUGOI SUGOI - SUGOI SUGOI - SUGOI SUGOI - SUGOI SUGOI - SUGOI SUGOI - SUGOI SUGOI -GHSUGOI SUGOI

[Taichi]
"It's the kind of Hi-Tech stuff that senses when you are in the dark and automatically turns on a light, yes."
//heeeeey like his eeeeyes -GHS
[Taichi]
"That's why it's always sparkly inside my pants. It's like Saturday Night Fever in here!"
//You can tell by the way he uses his walk/that he's bowlegged, it's all Youko's fault... but can we look the other way, and understand the Bible's effect on man? -GHS

I show a wry smile myself to that side of me that is just a naughty little lad with excessively high-tech briefs.
//That song was the bee's gees -GHSoSorry
It was a face like the prideful face of a top breeder of expensive pet dogs.
//Hum, 愛犬 pet dog vs. 愛刀 favored sword. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But they're popular with the housewives. Even inside the sheets, they can find their husband's 'son' all so very easily! (ULOL)"
//Son is an euphemism for penis. ... ... ... ...well, I've have run out of material on the subject and I'm just over halfway through. Awww balls. -GHS

* ULOL = US American-style smiley. The power that
  Americans are endowed with enabling them to provide

//Sorta-different from CCB0008B. Curiously, he says it's just a "smile", and though 笑 can also mean that, it's usually translated as 'lol' in this context. So it's a smiley. -GHS

[Miki]
"Whoooa, so adult'ow〜!"
//Continuing the one from above, this one would also be "so futile". -GHSUGOI SUGOI

[Taichi]
"Ehhh, did you make me wear a new pair of underpants?"

I look at Miki.
She's red in the face, and averting her eyes.

[Taichi]
"...y-, you... couldn't possibly..."

[Miki]
"Y-, yeah... when you fell down in the streets, Senpai... I picked you up... and from the... cuff... of the pants, tlunk-tlunk there fell fragments of the chastity belt..."
//Nanaka destroyed Youko's chastity belt. SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

Don't that mean she knows it's a chastity belt!!!
I fell on my face.
//Lit. "I fall prostrate". On his bed... lying down... without seeing his underwear...???? Let's say it's metaphorical(tm). -GHS

[Miki]
"And then I dragged you all the way home, Senpai..."

Whoa, these abrasions all over my body were caused by that?!

[Miki]
"I went strippity-strip with the trousers, and... badaboom."
//See, of course, CCC3018 -GHS

Why did you even need to strippity-strip the trousers at all!
//I don't care, nugi-nugi is strippity-strip. It is the LAURRRGGGHw. -GHS

[Miki]
"And from there I have about thirty minutes of memories missing... when I was aware again, I was on the school rooftop..."
//Thirty is written 三十 "3 10", 3-10=7. Memories gone, "when she was aware" she was elsewhere: just like Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

Was it so creepy that she had to run away and lose her memory?!
//Though it's nearly what's going on with himself, so... -GHS

[Miki]
"I returned, and I steeled myself for the worst... for this Miki here has made you wear the underpants she thinks best suit you indeed!

[Taichi]
"...hoh."

I try to look inside my trousers.
My underwear was an elephant.
//And now I can't shake the idea that this is a tribute to Leisure Suit Larry 7, which had... http://kivopolis.informe.com/gallery/147-2/larry7-002-orig.jpg (more SFW than this thing is) (yes, he trumpets them later in the scene). First Lucasarts with Zak McKracken, now Sierra with Larry? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Suit me?! These are the ones that best suit me?!"

The front part ends in a bag, and that seems to be quite a... sharpening on its elephantism, isn't it.
Rather than panties, this is a rod cover.
//Google insists there's nothing naughty about the term, and it's about protectors for clotheslines or somesuch. Bad google. Bad. -GHS
Miki goes shy.

[Miki]
"I-, it's just... I just wanted to see a gentleman wear them once! I am satisfied now!"

I had satisfied Miki while unaware.
Dammit... to be toyed with by Miki-Miki...
Whyyy did you not awake right then, myself!

[Miki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"...I am disgusted by myself."
//This can, naturally, mean both "I wish I had woken up" and "I'm so tired to want to play sexual pranks of that sort". -GHS

A "?" appears on Miki's face.

[Taichi]
"Well, whatever. More importantly, you saved me. Even with how I am, falling down under the blazing sun would be a crushing blow to my physical condition."

[Miki]
"Nooothing it's nooothing."

[Taichi]
"I feel like I absolutely must express my gratitude somehow."

[Miki]
"If all you would give to me, Senpai, is continuing to live your carefree life, that would be satisfying."

[Taichi]
"Miki... nice girl!"

Hug!
//The Trapa Japonica, also ひし, has nothing to do with walking calamari. And that leaves me endlessly puzzled. -GHS
And while I'm at it, ass rub.
//See CCA0011A. -GHS

[Miki]
"Get off me you elephant calf!"

[Taichi]
"Haw?!"

Man as I am, I had been made to undergo a fair amount of shame.

[Taichi]
"Right right, we some sandwiches here. Let's partake of this meal!"

[Miki]
"You're also amazing when you can take lots of punishment, Senpai."
//See Sakuraba. -GHS

I also lay out something to drink, even if it's not really cold.

[Taichi]
"It's exactly noon, right."

[Miki]
"Waaah, thank you for the food!"

She jumped on.
Munch, munch, munch.
Single-minded dedication to eating.

[Miki]
"Munch, munch... there's fresh vegetables... munch... inside!"
//She knows he didn't make them. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mh-mmh!"

[Miki]
"I would've just grabbed anything at hand and be done with it..."

[Taichi]
"You must eat your vegetables!"
//See CCC3019A. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yeees I know, but, well."

Ah right, Youko-chan said she would come back by noon, but,
she should have already come by now.
She could be,
behind me!
...she's not there?
//She's "dead". Pretty much simultaneously with Nanaka smashing his chastity belt. Or is it the opposite, her "death" being simultaneous with Miki coming to his house and nursing him? Hmmm, shades of Alfred Hitchcock here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But... what's even going on in this world now."
//Normal conversation -> Youko -> parallel world talk. He totally fell asleep/began hallucinating mid-talk. -GHS

[Miki]
"Munch?"

[Taichi]
"On one hand people are no more, on the other hand there's simply no bodies around us."
[Taichi]
"Animals are no more as well."
[Taichi]
"But the reason we are still living is that this annihilation doesn't seem to extend to the microorganisms inside our bodies... what a convenient Fall we have here."
//COUGH COUGH, HINT HINT. -GHS

[Miki]
"......"
//"Damn, he just won't get out of his delusion, will he." -GHS

There is no response.

[Taichi]
"Miki? Are you listening?"

[Miki]
"Ah, yes... We have lost Ourselves in this deliciousness..."
//She's dodging the question. ...if he ever spoke, that is. Unless she gets really lost in eating, as Taichi and Yutaka in their own way. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You a starving orphan or something?"

[Miki]
"Well, may I get some of these vegetables here?"

[Taichi]
"Go on, go on."

[Miki]
"Eating vegetables means a life unshackled by constipation!♪"
//Actually, if she's into the We_rd, she'd have more like diarrhea. Oh, don't look at me like that, remember how much come the Japanese eat every day. -GHS

[Taichi]
"A bit of shame, miss..."

Making herself easily read is a good thing, though.

[Miki]
"So, what was it?

[Taichi]
"Just chasing the Mystery of the Annihilation of Humanity, that-is-all."
//"I was just playing in my chuuni settei." -GHS

[Miki]
"We were just late, we were."
//According to CCC4025, they indeed missed it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I don't think so."

[Miki]
"You don't?"

[Taichi]
"Couldn't it be, yannow, that mankind whole is just being abducted as we speak?"
//"Kamikakushi" (rapture) isn't too technically incorrect. After all, what's all his chuuni delusion but mistaking God for some hyperintelligent alien? -GHS

[Miki]
"...you truly got the brains, Senpai."
//Double irony. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hahaha, don't speak so well of me now."
[Taichi]
"Miki-chin, you're undeterred are you."

[Miki]
"Ahahah, I'm just carefree."

[Taichi]
"May I ask you your Conformity Coefficient?"

[Miki]
"Around 40."
//Roughly half Taichi's, and near Touko's. Like Taichi, she's got an Alter Ego; hers is real, perhaps unlike Taichi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Not too bad, passable, yeah."

[Miki]
"No impact on social life at all."
//This isn't so much a lie as it's copying stuff that's been said by someone else - and so far, by Taichi. It may be just Gunjou lingo, but the point is, it's a lie as she's probably more broken than he is. ...then again, it's never really said that conformity's a *good* thing, is it? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Has it always been around that?"

[Miki]
"Yes. Ever since I was a kid."

[Taichi]
"I see, is that why you ended up being sent to Gunjou then?"

[Miki]
"...I did cause a bitty of injuries to people. But that was when I was in my Loli era."
//Hokkaido dialect. Hmmm. See CCA0003. But were they in the Touko/Misato range, or...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, loli innit. Niiice ain't they, lolis. I wish I had met you then!"
//Because as we all know, Taichi reeeally hates loli. -GHS

"I have pictuuures!"

"B-, but you're making a pretty Real Serious face now..."
//See CCC3019B. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because I want them for Real. How much?"

[Miki]
"...TH-, THINKING　IN PROGRESS."
//fucking slow AI taking forever to make its move -GHS

She became frightened,
and instantaneously as well.
//She generally takes this stuff really too seriously, so she might be truly embarrassed; however, given she likely knows "Youko" is dead, that may be the point. Or maybe she's just reminded of the losing Kiri path. -GHS

[Miki]
"Speaking of that... my lips... you stole them didn't you."

Her voice lowered.

[Taichi]
"Ngh... aaah, that thing, yes. No, it's just that the kick you gave me had with such an exquisite timing, and there was a little heat..."
//Supposing it's the Hiza Kakkun -GHS

[Miki]
"And it was my first kiss too..."

[Taichi]
"It-, it did feel like it."
[Taichi]
"Still, Miki, you burned up my heart because you unleashed an attack so very sharp, indeed!"
//lit. "struck", but since it's "hotto", going with pun with the "heeto" above. -GHS

[Miki]
"Nggghhh..."

For a while, Miki just muttered all 'ngh, ngh'.

[Miki]
"...I must give up and consider this as if having been bitten by a stray dog, with no owner that a law could judge..."
//http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q125091482 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Th-, that is fine."

Quickly she raises her head.

[Miki]
"So, should I forget my troubles by exposing the contents of this camera to the world?"

[Taichi]
"I-, is that a disposable camera?!"

[Miki]
"Is that the part that surprises you now..."
//Indeed the focus is odd. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, right. My mistake."
[Taichi]
"What have you been photographing?"

[Miki]
"Senpai's elephant. I have 24 exposures."
//She couldn't afford a 36 exposure model? 24 exposure limits means it's a film camera, further showing that the VN takes place in 1998. -GHS

[Taichi]
"WHAT'D YOU SAAAY!!!

My Embarrassing Stem is getting EmbaStem'd!"
* EmbaStem'd = flogged.
//Chikei. 笞刑 (flogging) has the same pronunciation. The masochist. Added it as a sort-of Taichian word since puns do not exist in English(tm). -GHS

[Miki]
"Should I stick theee〜m, on a notice board, or-in-its-stead, maybe I'll scatter it arooo〜und♪!"
//"Sung-ish". See CCA0004, Taichi does the same to Touko's bill. "Notice board" since bullettin board sounds BBS-ish. Not that anyone pays any attention, but, well, *I* try to. -GHS

"S-, stop I beg, that's insane!"
//Keeping it consistent with CCA0015, CCB000B (as it's Miki) -GHS

[Miki]
"Hmmm, my first kiss's been stolen wasn't iiit. Indeed this has to be made public don't iiit."

[Taichi]
"Have mercy!"
//Recurring -GHS

[Miki]
"Will you do what I tell you to do?"

[Taichi]
"Willdowilldo!"
//spacesareforwimps -GHS

She rubs her hands together.

[Miki]
"Then for each thing I order you to do that you actually do, I will return you one picture."

[Taichi]
"This Kurosu Taichi here intends to acquiescently submit even to a demand so incredibly Eroge-like as that!"
//For of course no reason whatsoever, since humanity would be gone (as if!), and Taichi should not care... like he didn't in CCA0022. Very telling. -GHS

[Miki]
"Heh heh heh〜"
[Miki]
"First of all, bullying Kiri-chin is now forbiddeeen!"

[Taichi]
"Hahaaah!"

[Miki]
"Sexual harassment with love, as well."

[Taichi]
"Hahahahaaah!"

I bow my head.
Complete turnabout of master and servant.
And with things being like that, we came to school.
I'm being made to carry Miki's bags as her escort.
//...how many bags DO these guys bring to school? Maybe it's just the bag and the crossbow. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So then, we came here and that's OK, but whaddowedoo?"
//This comment intentionally left blank as the translator backs away slowly. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, ah'm joining up with Kiri here."
//See CCA0008. Valley girl my ass... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Aye aye!"
//http://zokugo-dict.com/01a/aiyo.htm oh look, I learned something about Japanese that wasn't completely horrifying today again. -GHSob

I hand over her bag.
//Now it's just a kaban? K. -GHS

[Miki]
"By the way, I'll be developing these as well!"
//Developing color film by hand is an absolute PITA (and my parents have done so professionally for a while, so they know), which makes it quite suspect. Maybe she just does it B&W, but it remains somewhat odd: she's a genius loli archetype, sure, and she knows PC and stuff, sure, but there's nothing anywhere indicating that she'd know about this. In fact, CCC3016 seems to deny this, since developing photos is a specialized skill. Maybe she just lolis up some of the Photography Club members. Oh, and 'loli' as a verb is now part of the official canon of the English language, so feel free to use it in your fanfics -GHS

She takes out the camera and makes the toughest of laughs.
//Same as with the friendship demands sentence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...nghhh, I'm your love slaaave!"

[Miki]
"Then well then!"

She went leaving with light steps.
And now...
//Possibly another choice removed here. -GHS
This was always the corridor BG, unlike in CCC0021. -GHS
And in the end, I may have gone to school but there was nothing to do.
Should I just go home?
But... I wonder if being this leisurely is right.
Because the world has fallen into ruin.

[Taichi]
"..."

I wonder what I ought to do.
What could I even do.
A grandiose riddle is fine to have, but clues to solve it I don't have.
//Just make some shit up and then claim you haven't. Insulting anyone who tries to understand as dumb. Insult anyone who points out that you're contradicting yourself as mistrusting and uncaring. It'll totally work! -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

Not true I don't have nothing.
The hokora---
Nanaka and Youko-chan both mentioned it.
The hokora, right.
I got spare time, maybe I should just go have a look, then.

[Miki]
"Taichi-senpai!"
//A mature thing to call him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nmoh, Miki?"

And Kiri as well.
With steamy stuffy animosity.

[Taichi]
"Kiri, you look so tired."

[Kiri]
"...whose fault is that... sigh."
//See CCC0014. Wait a second, this should be hours after that! How is she still tired? Well, it's no more than minutes after that, of course.  -GHS

She was dead tired.
//Hur hur hur I said tired. -GHS

[Miki]
"Dumb little Miki here has one proposal for these two people getting along so extremely bad from the very opening day of the new school term."

[Taichi]
"It's not bad between us, not really."

[Kiri]
"It is bad."

Plainly.
//See CCA0008 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh... well, then we're getting along bad after all. What do we do?"

[Miki]
"Club activities!"

[Taichi]
"Club? That stuff that Tomoki's doing?"

[Miki]
"No, what President-senpai is doing!"

[Taichi]
"...ahhh, hers."

On Sunday night,
//And he just keeps referring to Sunday rather than "yesterday", despite it having been actually yesterday. Same with CCA0003, where he doesn't refer to the last weekend as such. And Nanaka even asks if it is was Summer vacation. All very very very interesting details to have. -GHS
we had decided on our course of action in this world where all traces of mankind were no more.
Wait and see---
We are people whose relationships had been severed.
//Between each other, sure, but also with the world... perhaps. -GHS
There would never have been other ways.
Within that, plans were made: Tomoki would secure and distribute food, while Mimi-senpai would use the antenna to send an SOS.
//WHY DONT THIS GAME HAVING MORE SEMICOLOOONS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; -GHS
The conclusion of the training camp was colored by quarrel, and everyone was weary.
Therefore, there was no one who agreed with them.
//Odd. it can't be that no one agreed with them since it's stated very clearly that Miki and Kiri did in, uhm, where was it... bwaaah I don't remember. It's in Kiri's route. -GHS
Honestly, Senpai seemed a bit neurotic of late,
and the training camp I unreasonably forced on her became the finishing blow to that.
...I felt what I had done was inexcusable.
At least as much as it seemed that it would be hard to approach and talk to her.

[Miki]
"This is an order. Let us get along together in the club."
//Interesting that Miki, despite being technically omniscent, still believes that the normal everyday is the answer. Then again, you can't run away from a prison of your own devise... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...got it."

Ah, whatever. I don't have objections.
//See CCC0000: he's just a spineless twerp, really. -GHS

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin too!"

Paf, she slaps her back.

[Kiri]
"I said I get it..."

Is her weakness also being exploited then?
//Mizumi--- Misato style. More imitative behavior. -GHS

[Miki]
"If you don't do as I say... I will be posting up those photos, ya know?"
//See CCD0008B -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ugggh... that's insane..."
//Still same. Very interesting she'd find this embarrassing without anyone anywhere... though the excuse would be that she fears Taichi. -GHS

I knew it.

[Taichi]
"Uhm, but is it OK if we just go to the rooftop and offer our help?"

[Miki]
"In-deed. Quietly, and without unruliness."

[Taichi]
"I'll do my best."

[Kiri]
"Toilet..."
//lol gurlz R always in teh toiletz. -GHS

[Miki]
"Aw, come on!"
//She sounds like Kiri should've gone on ahead already... -GHS

Kiri enters the girls' toilet.
Miki follows.
I follow as well.

[Miki]
"...don't come in all casual-like."

I'm pushed out.
I and Miki are separated by the boundary line between toilet and corridor.
//Is it empty? Lolololololol another reference nooo ooone will get -GHS

[Miki]
"Your bad habit has surfaced."
[Miki]
"When bad things happen, Kiri-chin goes hikikomori."
//See CCB0006, CCB0007, CCC0033A. Lots of people doing that... with the added lie that it's Miki who does so of the two, see CCD3003, CCD4002A, not Kiri. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Your typical sensitive teenager."

[Miki]
"And therefore, please go on ahead of us."

[Taichi]
"Mh-hm."
[Taichi]
"But before that, I want you to have this, Miki."

I took it out.

[Miki]
"What is this?"

[Taichi]
"It's a small snap gun."
//Term googles to stuff like http://j.tokkyoj.com/data/E05B/3077078.shtml which should be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_gun -GHS

It was a tool the size of a a fountain pen cut in half.
//Real snap guns seem quite a bit bigger. It's very likely home made, they seem a lot smaller. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's lockpicking tool. It'll come in handy. It's small and it has no durability, so when you reach the shear line there is a possibility that the plate would get chipped. Handle with care."
//Curiously, I'm not certain what the payoff for this much setup is supposed to be. He'll pick a lock in CCD1001, but there's no mention of a snapgun there. I suspect this is how he can get into school when it's well before dawn, but that's sort of it. So I'll make my own: henceforth "handing a girl your snapgun to help her pick locks" shall be an official euphemism for sex. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_line_%28locksmithing%29 -GHS

[Miki]
"...why do you have this?"
//And yes, I checked, no, it's not a reference to that Resident Evil line. It sounds perfectly normal in Japanese anyway, even if the speech is in English in every version. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hobby. If you get good at it, a normal lock should take no more than 30 seconds."
//Sure it's not 貫 pierce? This is much more interesting after knowing that he lakes Wacchi. This guy is waaay not into privacy. Remember that thing from week 1 about having 'shopped pictures of people? How unlikely's that now. -GHS

[Miki]
"Right... so with a skill like this... no matter where you hide it's pointless isn't it..."
//See CCC0009. Closest this comes to making sense is simply pointing out that there'd be no escape for Miki no matter where she hides, but this thread is very much dangling. -GHS

In a whisper.

[Taichi]
"Eh, what?"

[Miki]
"Nooothing. I will be taking it for now. Not that I need it, but..."
[Miki]
"By the way, are you skilled with a lockpick?"
//He just said that when you're used to it you can do it in 30 seconds! What the hell is this scene? -GHS

[Taichi]
"I could do it unconsciously."
//...because he can do it easily when he's Youko...? Who never ever picks a lock ever? And here's the only thing remotely within payoff: there's nothing prevent him from snap-gunning that chastity belt off seconds after Youko leaves. Yet he doesn't. -GHS

[Miki]
"Hopeless... this guy's just..."

[Taichi]
"Well, see you later."

I headed towards the rooftop.
