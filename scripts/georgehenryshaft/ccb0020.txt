Our beach outing was fun.
Even now I remember everybody's merrymaking.

[Touko]
"KYAAAAH!? Where did you just grab meee?!"

[Taichi]
"On the part of the swimsuit that covers your ass."

[Misato]
"Hasekura-san, you say... what is even your relationship with her, Kurosu-kun?"

[Taichi]
"Hm? Youko-chan?"

 Touko: "YOUKO-CHAN?!"

[Misato]
"YOUKO-CHAN!?!"

  Miki: "YOUKO-CHAAAAN?"

[Tomoki]
"YOUKO-CHAN!!!"

[Miki]
"What a Yakuza, really."

[Misato]
"My-, my body you caaa〜n't!"

[Yusa]
"A-uhm, if I maying may may mayyyyyy!!!!!!"
//She has the name... well, since she's even onscreen now. -GHS

[Touko]
"Iii-diot."

[Yusa]
"Ah, this way, this wayay?"

[Miki]
"It-, it huuu〜rts, forehead huuu〜rts!"

[Misato]
"...(mutter, mutter, mutter)"

[Taichi]
"But we still had fun."

Our fun beach outing has with this concluded.
As for Miki's cut, it only left behind a very small scar.
Nevertheless, on the way back, said Miki had the most bright and cheerful face on her,
as if she had obtained something in exchange for being hurt.
That's what her face said.
After that, Misato-senpai had to help bring in the antenna for the Broadcast Club, and returned to school.
Tomoki, not yet wholly torn apart from his sister, said something sarcastic.
His sisconlike ways were then ridiculed by Miki, then still in the third year of the middle school subordinate to Gunjou.
Yusa-chan opened her heart a little to the concept of group for the first time.
//Not just these guys, but groups in general. She is obviously too shy to have friends, especially after the Conformity Test. -GHS
And that had been our beach outing.
