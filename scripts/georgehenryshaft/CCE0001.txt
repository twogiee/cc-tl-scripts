Hasekura Youko returned to her one-room apartment.
//This script is largely in third person, and includes things that Taichi can't possibly know. Unless he's walking around and chatting to the people, despite being too "gone" to understand this, or something. But maybe it's all a dream. And maybe he just killed them all. It's definitely, certainly, indubitably troll. -GHS
//It's not a "room" as intended generally in English, and it's not an "apartment" as intended in the same, so making explicit. This would be after school. -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

Yet relaxing one's guard upon returning to her territory is not like Youko.
She slipped through a tower of books piled up high, tossed her bag on the bed, and turned on the power for her machines.
//She doesn't keep the PCs always on? Electricity's free of charge, remember CCA0002, and she has peeping cameras in Taichi's room. Well, maybe she stopped, see below. -GHS
In the six-tatami space there exist three PCs with LCD monitors.
//This seems somewhat more modern technology than what's been seen so far. Taichi's PC has a CRT, for starters, and so does the club room - which has been described as having top-grade stuff, see CCD1001. No LCD is ever seen or heard of before. This takes place after 1998, and going by numbers in CCX0001, 2003 is probable. Six tatami is two less than the space reported by Taichi to be his toilet, see CCC3012B. I suspect it's no coincidence. -GHS
The rack, arranged in an L shape and set parallel to the room, is discernibly thin.
//L=り ri. Hum, it IS an unit of measurement, but I don't see it. 12th letter of the alphabet... plus the 3 PCs it has on and the 6 tatami room it's in, 7x3=21. But that's probably coincidence. -GHS
While all three were utilized for a flawless stalking, now, except for one machine that could be said to be dedicated for browsing, they are almost never used.
//3 whole PCs? What's she doing with them? Are peeping cameras so processor expensive? Uh, not that I don't use 2 PCs myself, but... wait that's actually three, but, uhm, you know what nevermind. Don't see numbers here. -GHS
Because their target is no more.
Bookshelves are infixed in the wall, so tall they seemed to stab through the ceiling, and crammed to the brim with specialized technical books of all kinds.
//Now that's an use for the word 'kill' that even I didn't expect. (Though I do tend to expect words to have a sexual meaning. Often correctly.) -GHS
Not only in Japanese, but also in English and in German, all jumbled together.
She can read all of them, so dividing them by language has little point.
The overflow from the shelves ends in a number of pillars on the floor.
//See CCC3025, she's remade the same room she had at the Mansion. Did she even escape at all, inside herself at least? What does it say about Taichi, who seemingly remade the same world he was in? -GHS
Perhaps because she's not laid hand on them recently, these columns were also capped by a thin layer of dust.
Tools and high-tech related machines also attract the eye.
//While the scientific bullcrap is obvious troll, the level of imprecision in sentences like these makes me wonder if Tanaka's doing even this on purpose. -GHS
There is much inside, but fundamentally, this is plain room.
It is a room that exists for the purpose of achieving a goal.
Except for a single solitary thing, nothing exists here that can be said to be for entertainment.
//So where did Taichi get all his videogame education? And she doesn't even surf for porn, or have a walk-in closet full of clothes, not to mention giant dil-GHS
It's a room filled with knowledge and with means.
That is what her private room was.
She sits in the chair, performing her daily routine.
Checking the mail, skimming the news.
//Who sends her mail...? Maybe the investors or something. -GHS
Corrupted politicians,
juvenile criminals,
concealment of medical malpractice.
The world never changes.
The number of suicides has been steadily increasing as well.
//There it is, ergo the "please live". -GHS
An innocent forum post was flowing by on that webpage about suicide, and it's on it that Youko's eyes stopped.
Because there was the word, "radio".
The contents of the site itself were silly and innocently about occultism.
//That recurring term... -GHS
You can hear the voice of a ghost, or maybe of a god, from the radio.
//Technically it's not a big deal to hear "the voice of a god", as written in Japanese. Of course, that's exactly where the troll is. -GHS
It seems to have the strength to stop the suicides of those who hear.
She quickly loses interest.
She goes on to several foreign sites, in order to check the trends of her investments.
Up to this point, it has all been mechanical.
Customarily, she reads books as necessary, or she fiddles around with her machines.
//Sorry, I can't make that sound like something that isn't an obvious euphemism for masturbation. Worst of all, it might be one. -GHS
However, today she has no plans.
The last few days she has been making adjustment on the online trading of a number of stocks that have been showing interesting movement.
Having capital is good.
It's useful when push comes to shove.
//Which is why Scrooge McDuck here lives in a six tatami apartment that's a perfect replica of her room at the mansion. -GHS
So is physical strength.
And today as well ended up being nothing but training.
These motions, performed in practiced automatism, contribute to the preservation of Youko.
Previously, there had been an objective:
to make herself worthy and capable, and leave for the outside.
In the time she spent at the Hasekura Estate, that, she thought, was everything.
And for that purpose she devoted herself to study.
However, that target ended up being replaced,
at the same time when she established she was half of a body.
//Can literally be read "at the exact moment when the Settei called for me to be half a body". -GHS
Her skills were then being polished for the sake of protecting this inexperienced half of her.
//She may have "fallen" for him when she broke him. -GHS
And then he went away.
//...that's one big jump otherwise. -GHS
All that points to him had vanished.
//Odd. It sounds like he was removed from the timeline entirely. Of course, since Youko still exists, that means he's occasionally showing up: when he plays Youko. -GHS
And yet, what could Youko be thinking of these mechanical aspects of her own self that still continue their motions?
Understanding via the divination of her rare facial expressions is impossible.
She switched off the power of her PC.
The room grows dark in an instant.
Youko continues to sit in her chair.
Her assignment was over.
//See CCA0016A/B, CCD1001. Hmmm. -GHS
Other things to do she doesn't have.
She looks at the clock. Far too early to sleep.
//Such as... 6 o'clock. Although it's dark; it's the only scene in which it's dark, except for Taichi's which is obviously noon. -GHS
Inadvertently,
her eyes stopped on the sole and only item of entertainment that was hanging from the wall.
It's a thin, card-type radio.
She ended up leaving it switched on.
//THAT she leaves always on...? Shouldn't there be static? That radio is always completely silent, and it's just a metaphor for how "she" (definitely the others) still see Taichi talking to them every once in a while... whether he's too far gone to hear them, whether it's a chat that maintains the proper distance and therefore, metaphorically, indistinguishable from him not being there anymore in that perverted, if ordinarily longed for, sense. -GHS
She has never heard an appeal or anything of the sort on that frequency, not once.
Occasionally, broadcasts from some distant land have flown in.
//Maybe from Hokkaido? See CCA0003. -GHS
That, and nothing more.

[Youko]
"......"

Youko released a sigh, and devoted herself to hours of idle inactivity.
How many have even passed by now?
Youko awoke in an instant from her light shut-eye,
and stared, fixed, at the radio.
She felt that she could hear a deep breath,
carrying with it a nostalgic, specific presence.

[Taichi]
"...this... Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club."

The impact smashes through Youko.
She takes the radio in her hand,
and she could not do anything but that.
Not even the idea of making a recording came to her.
//That's piracy, dude. Buy the damn thing, it's still for sale! But yeah, how damn convenient, isn't it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Are there people still living out there?"

That is what the radio said.
No mistake.

[Youko]
"...Tai... chi?"

[Taichi]
"Should any be there, please listen to me."

[Youko]
"Taichi."

But voices on this side cannot reach him.
//Yet she holds it like she'd hold a cellphone, as most will. Can they, truly? He's just making prank calls, is he. -GHS
She leans her ear to the broadcast.
//Seems to be meant literally given the CG. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

The face she had was with her mouth open slack-jawed, as if her ghost had just escaped from it.
//See CCB2009/CCD2002. Odd Touko reference. -GHS
From the radio Taichi's voice flows in. Breathing.
The broadcast ended in the twinkle of an eye.
//This sequence is very odd. It's in the past, but the actual end of the broadcast is below, so it can't well have ended here. May just be imprecise writing. Yet, except for Sakuraba, we hear the broadcast with the rest, not mostly Youko's thoughts. Furthering, of course, the suspicions that the reason this is so is because she and Taichi are the same person. And maybe the contradiction is supposed to further underline this. -GHS
His voice that could no longer be heard.
Yet still Youko kept the radio to the ear for a long time.
It was love.
It was desire.
It was the opposite gender.
//Now see CCD1001: opposite gender awareness, just like Misato. Perhaps Kiri. -GHS
Just as Taichi had said, Youko's feelings may have just perhaps been impure.
Youko's inclination was to make herself automatic for the sake of an objective, excessively so.
//Likely her true ultramarine is a simple monomania. See her room, again. -GHS
The shape of that love could very possibly be seen as hideous.
But... the favoritism was the real thing.
Taichi alone was the sole and only thing that could disturb Youko's heart.
Her own self isn't perfect, after all,
and Youko knew that.
And all the more at that time of their childhood:
her responsibility for making use of a boy that had turned his sight to her with longing, and then ending up distorting his soul.
Her weakness of not killing just even one person on the day of the massacre,
//She thinks that was weakness? She still got lots to go then. -GHS
this self of hers that only stood stock still, knee-deep in the dead, blade in hand.
//Too young to die? -GHS
He was one of those Others in whom she had no interest in. That was the first time she had seen one being destroyed.
//Might also refer to the first person Taichi killed. -GHS
A being that merely shuddered at the ugliness of the world.
A one-sided bond, not even of co-dependence.
What would have been the right thing to do?
What could she have done, so that she could be walking together with Taichi?
//As he walks with God... -GHS
Her thoughts, composed, that knew no disturbance,
were now shaking like a helpless child.

[Youko]
"Ngggh..."

Groaning.
She failed.
Failed failed failed.

[Taichi]
"...see you next week."

The broadcast ends.
//As it ended above. -GHS
Simultaneously, she broke down crying.

[Youko]
"Nggggh, NghUUUUUh..."

It was an outrageously enormous amount of repentance.
//And now they're even. -GHS
This was the first time since the day she was born that Youko had felt this emotion.
The height of dolorousness.
//Lit. "seriousness", but this should be the sense. -GHS
From the bottom of the heart, the thought,
that she should have done so much better---
//Since repentance is everything, as well as forgiveness, there's some hope for her. Or "her". -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...nee-san, bath's hot now."

Shima Tomoki called out into the still unfinished private room of his sister Misato, who had come to live into the house of her mother's side.
//Meaning her mother has forgiven her too. No little detail! Certainly more important than how Tomoki's house isn't on the map. -GHS

[Misato]
"Thank you."

The door was opening,
and in the halfway width of his field of vision there was Misato, stiffening her posture with a knee drawn up.

[Tomoki]
"......"

That posture of her made him feel just a little uneasy.
//Due to siscon, of course. -GHS
He dips only the upper half of his body in the room, and stares.
Up to now, this had been used as sort of a storehouse,
a spare room that smells of dust.
Yet, because a girl had lodged there for a number of days, it now smelled like this.
That, to Tomoki, was an inexplicable mystery.
Tomoki had become aware of his sister's being of different gender a long time ago.
//Reminds of above, which should remind straight back. The proper distance between these siblings is the same that there should've been between Youko and Taichi all along. Temptation included. -GHS
He did not stray from the straight and narrow, because... of a cowardice rivaling his urge, which is a common disposition between siblings.
In these days, with him having a girlfriend and all, that impulse-like thing Tomoki originally had was in the process of being diluted.
//I totally thought that 'kanojo' referred to Misato and that it was brocon all along (no, brAcon is a dentist supplier, though it's in es-SEX and that's why it's still relevant); but no, see CCA0007. This is the second and last mention of her. "Impulse" is the same term Taichi uses for his problem in CCX0001, once again demonstrating the worthlessness of the test. -GHS

[Misato]
"...what is it?"

Before long Misato took notice.
And Tomoki as well witnessed his sister's stare.
//Ugh. More troll? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"That radio... is that...?"

[Misato]
"Ahhh, this."

She raises it towards him.

[Misato]
"Yes, indeed... from that time..."

A bitter smile.

[Tomoki]
"..."

Once, the two of time had a friend. A very good friend.
//Nakama is almost as strong as nanaka -GHS
He had a particularly eccentric personality, even for the standards of the gathering spot for oddballs that is Gunjou.
He was said to be Gunjou's most seriously ill boy.
//Also "claimed to be"/"asserted to be". The subtle implication is that he wasn't, not necessarily. -GHS
Permanently in a manic state, always raising hell, constantly subjecting people to outrageous pranks.
//He was always outlandish, not nasty. Sexual harassment and gentle mode; no Mass Murderer mode. -GHS
But Misato knew.
On occasion, when she peered at him while going to surprise him, he showed this unbelievably expressionless face... and that was the kind of boy he was.
Upon noticing Misato's existence, the focal point of his eyes would vacantly come together, and then slowly he would mold a smile.
//See CCA0006: that's exactly what Misato does, sealing their similitude as seen especially in CCD1001. And if Misato and Taichi are so similar, are their actions (and their sins) incomparable? ...and if Yusa is so parallel to Misato, then Taichi and Yusa must also be similar, further strengthening the idea that Yusa didn't reject him, he rejected her. -GHS
Yes, mold.
//On the surface of the moon tiny little maggots gush forth in countless number, maggots that mold a smiling face on the surface of the moon. -GHS
The conscious assembly of a smile.
Fundamentally, he did not understand this thing called 'a person'.
That he only knew how to imitate, however, she learned long after getting to know him.
//See CCD1001. She knew all along, but getting conscious of it... -GHS
Hasekura Youko had given her just this one warning:
I don't care if you're his friend. But after you take notice---
Was he that terrifying a boy?
//See CCD5001. Of course Youko would say that, she's terrified of him! This warning is troll; the reason he keeps his face on check is very different, it's because he's been trained by the Hasekuras to display a smile on command: see CCC0000. And that would've only worsened after the Shinkawas came around. -GHS
Certainly, he had an oddly unstable aspect to him as well.
And Misato, still, worries about that.
Abruptly, the radio began making a sound.

[Tomoki]
"...what was?"

[Misato]
"Shhh."

They strain their ears.
That dim expectation was something the two had in common.
The same kind of nervousness filled them.
Sure enough, the radio picked up a tiny bit of sound.

[Taichi]
"...is any... person... listening... to this broadcast?"
//How awesome that all the words they hear form the complete sentence? He's totally talking to them from outside the window, is he. -GHS

Taichi's voice.

[Tomoki]
"...what, is...?"

[Misato]
"Peke-kun..."

Fiddling with the tuner, she stabilized the sound.
With held breath, they lend their ears.

[Taichi]
"This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club."
[Taichi]
"And I made this week tooo!"
[Taichi]
"This was episode number, ah who cares."
//Now a popular fanservice-ridden 12 episode anime! -GHS
[Taichi]
"Number five or number six, I guess."
//It'd have been like 5-6 weeks since they left? I don't think so, bub. Try some years. ...or maybe it's just #7. -GHS

His voice seemed very indifferent to what was going on around him, which left them dumbfounded.
//This makes perfect sense if he's standing right next to them. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Have you been losing your hearts to others as usual? Are you in good spirits?"
//See CCC3004. It's the same pun, and that's another hint that he's talking to them directly. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I am in good spirits!"
[Taichi]
"...I'm working nicely through things, and living on."

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Well, now... truth is, I'm living on desperately."
//Like his father... -GHS

The boy was sniffling.
Lately, I've come to understand several things...
//No tags again. -GHS
Long ago, I ended up being able to understand
a lot of things that I wanted to know, one right
after the other.
I was crying a bit, making that baby's face
as if to cry a bit.
//Baby Taichi !important! -GHS
......
//His speechlessness is double than what it was before. -GHS
And one of the things that I've been thinking
about of late is this:
whether it's possible to come to love a person
unconditionally.
//In other words, for whether Misato and Tomoki can go on without gettin' it on. -GHS
I knew it was important. But I couldn't think
of that as important.
Something like, I understood in theory, but the
emotions wouldn't accept it...
I took the humans around me as nothing but
worthless things, and always made light of them.
I kept them at a distance, unconversant, alone.
//This is far more credible than his chuuni background of Evily Evil. -GHS
As if I had no interest in them.
//See top, like Youko. -GHS
But the reality was different.
It was just that I didn't know how to love
people... and I wanted to.
Yes, and certain people had taught me this:
that you will get to love someone, for the
sake of yourself.
And if there's that alone, that'll be fine.
And anything that goes after that you really
don't need to think about.
If I did... then that partner that is next to me
so matter-of-factly I would end up liking for no
other reason than because they're family,
or a sibling.
//Still reading this as a criticism towards Kana and Family Project's need to start love as family, if laterally of course. The concept of family in there is the Christian concept of all mankind having the same ancestors, not straightforwards incest. But who could read it like that? Even I didn't, and before Cross Channel I thought that Family Project's greatest failing was having the protagonist pick a girl between the family, completely betraying the concept. Now that it's obvious to me that the Family was an allegory for mankind, the meaning's obvious. Anyway, it's more hinting that he's talking straight to them, not in general. -GHS
Misato thought,
about coming to love someone.
What kind of suffering has Taichi had to go through for the sake of that?
Tomoki thought,
that he perhaps was, for Taichi, a someone with whom there could be the reciprocal exchange of the term, "friend".
When I managed to understand, there was no
one anymore.
//This isn't even Taichi speaking, it's straight-up the author. -GHS
And that is why I am telling this story here.
It's fine if there's no reply. As long as
someone is listening to it.
And that is why... I will be here.
You there, on the other side, whoever
you might be,
I will be here, definitely.
                See you next week.
Click, and the voice cuts off.
The radio does not throw any more word at them.
The siblings' gazes met.

[Misato]
"It's that boy..."

Tomoki nods in assent.

[Tomoki]
"...Taichi."

The two stood, motionlessly, in the heart of that faint darkness.
There is no talking.
There can only be silence.
Misato held the radio tight.
In the cold plastic, however, there were no traces of that boy.
She managed to recall.
The feeling of the skin. The scent of the hair. The breathing that remains on the edge of her ears.
In their overlapping of bodies, there was one single thing that she could understand.
That manic attitude in his moments of uproarious merrymaking was Taichi's wailing lament as he desperately attempted to come in contact with people.
In her spacious personal room, Touko had fallen prostrate on her desk.
In these tranquil days since her return, Touko had sunk into depression.
Alone, again.
Unchanged from before she had come to intimately know Taichi.
From the very start she had a tendency towards isolation.
//Hint hint, when she says everyone's gone... -GHS
On the other hand, if she became intimate for just a moment, her dependency knew no bounds.
To snuggle up to a partner she would, by means fair or foul, even end up selling off her pride.
That is a fragile side of her.
As she was like this, it was appropriate for Touko to be in a girl's school.
Yet, some years before, there had been a confrontation with classmates over a friend.
With dependence, male or female does not matter.
//TL Note: she fell for another girl. -GHS
What Touko fundamentally demands is someone entirely reliant on herself.
On the wake of her causing injury to this partner, Touko took the infamous National Exam.
//Original term is not necessarily about her hurting the other girl, might just be the same with Misato and Tomoki. It is not really precise, however. -GHS
And then... sent off to Gunjou.
Just because of that, friends scattered and disappeared.
No contact came, of any kind, any longer. And that made Touko grow increasingly headstrong.
//Spurious CR. This is why she believes there's no one anymore, as all her friends are gone, like Kiri, and no one's left that would approach her but Taichi, as she puts up a (fake) barrier. And she believes that because of the spurious CR! Damn typos, what perverted horror will they inflict on mankind next!!! -GHS
Touko's parents went so far as to move together with their estate for her, but for some reason their love did not heal her.
//That's insane no matter how much you put it. Especially considering the whole thing has to have come via train! -GHS
Likely, other people were necessary.
Her parents' love was as a matter of course.
//See thing above with Misato and Tomoki. -GHS
Touko wanted another human someone to discover her own value,
so that someone else would know it, even if Touko didn't.
//swap around -GHS
That is the purpose of her manners, for that encounter.
//IOW she was looking for precisely the kind of person Taichi was. Well, she's an idiot too. -GHS
Because she craved it until the point of death, once that was fulfilled, she got carried away.
Self-respect and the self as well she threw away.
...without even knowing that those are the most important of things.
A knock on the door, and a voice calls out to her.
It's the housekeeper, who has brought Touko's dinner with.

[Touko]
"...yes, just put it down there."

Her housekeeper pushed words at her, spurring her to go out every once in a while, and how being depressed all the time was no way to live.
//Someone's avoiding having an unvoiced character as well as setting aside the budget for a character with two lines a liiittle too hard. -GHS

[Touko]
"I don't feel like doing anything, no."

The housekeeper did not back down.
It was a worry uttered for mere form's sake.
//But not necessarily insincere, after all, so was Taichi's everything, technically. -GHS

[Touko]
"...I get it, I do."

Dismissing her curtly, she once again bends onto the desk.
Her belly bug cried.

[Touko]
"............"

Touko's body had always betrayed her.
//See CCA0012. Her body has evidence(tm). -GHS
She opens the door and brings in the food tray.
As she was having a meal on the verge of tears due to an equilibrium of anguish and hunger, a sound came from the radio.
//-de beso again? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Are you eating something delicious? This is the Gunjou Institute Broadcast Club!"
//He totally climbed through the window and waited for the moment. The bastard. -GHS

She ended up spitting out something delicious.
A fit of coughing.

[Touko]
"?!"

She adjust the radio's volume.

[Taichi]
"I am surviving favorably. It appears that people can live well even if alone."

[Touko]
"Taichi...?"

[Taichi]
"Are you living?"

That is what he just said, all of a sudden.
...I have been thinking often on the
subject of the heart.
The heart is the function of living.
Because if one does not stand for themselves, the
dominion of the heart will never expand.
//Those damn hexagons, why is life a stupid hex strategy game *grumble grumble* VASSAL *grumble grumble* zerg rush as a metaphor for *grumble*. -GHS
That is why people live alone.
That is why there is a distance laid between
person and person when they are born."
Making use of others is no problem. For the sake
of living to the fullest, a connecting bond with
someone is permissible.
But... assimilation with the partner is
impossible.
//This is directed straight and clear to Touko. -GHS
It is as impossible as it is for you listening to
this broadcast to touch me, and viceversa,
right now.
However, the frail heart does not want to
believe that.
It wants and works towards overlap.
//See CCX0001 as was tweaked, and the Another Story it references: overlap is how the worlds crossing are described. Which is impossible, it can never be a full overlap; hence the very idea that there is a Cross World is rejected, right in the very metaphor here! -GHS
It wants dependence, it wants servitude.
In all kind of means and ways it wants to
establish a bypass through the gap that exists
between the self and someone, anyone else.
But, you know, that is impossible.
People are born alone, and until death they
are alone, and that is why.
That discontinuity may just seem a hopeless
distance, perhaps.
It may be something that you dislike, perhaps.
But... I will be right here.
And I think that I will be broadcasting like
this again, next week.
//To keep more with また来週 -GHS
And the one after that, and the one after
that one as well.
Until I die.
As long as I am living here, and you keep on
living there... I'll be happy.
Because it will become an encouragement to
live on.
            Well, see you next week---
The broadcast cut off.
Touko grasped the radio tight, with strength enough to shatter it.
Her face cramps, very tightly.

[Touko]
"Living on you said... what's this... living on...?"
//See CCX0001, refusal of suicide. Seems like a simple thing, but there's ways to live that are like death itself. Like Touko's. -GHS
[Touko]
"I... have to live alone now?"

Being unacknowledged by Taichi, forever,
//Not "away from" or "forever unable to see him". Of course the term is technically unsuspicious. Technically. -GHS
without being able to vent her feelings at him either.
She was now being told to be satisfied with him just being there.
//Which was the philosophical point of the severance, which doesn't need to be physical at all. -GHS
She had no expectation should could manage to do that.
She knows very well about the weakness of her heart.
Well then, what to do?
Moving on to like, to love, another person?
Was that Taichi's wish then?
Touko's heart disorders in thousands of ways.

[Touko]
"Another person, really! I'll never find one... dummy."
[Touko]
"No one would ever end up loving this woman with her weirdness in the head..."

There had been no one who had come close and talked to her.
There had been no one but Taichi.

[Touko]
"I wanna meet you... Taichi..."
//These 'meet' sound a little off, but they're the de-facto opposite of 'cross'. -GHS

Transparent tears flow out.
She fell to her knees, slowly folding her self-worth until it is so small it might be gone... and touched her forehead to the floor.
//This means somewhat 'to kill'. Which is what will happen to JAPAN ALL PEOPLE for making tatami into a verb. I won't forgive this! -GHS
The arc described by her back began to shiver rapidly.
I wanna be spoiled,
//This sucks in third person in English. I thought about quotes but the lines are split, and there's another thing below that works better in first person but doesn't look good with quotes, so there it is. -GHS
because I'm weak.
I wanna be well and touched,
because I'm immature.
To stand alone,
to accomplish even merely that, how much time will it be necessary?
Touko, as she is right now, did not have any idea.
A magnificent ambiance as if picked fresh from a field of flowers floated into the old deserted storefront.
//Tasaki. See CCA0004, it's deserted because the guy's always somewhere on his hobby... hey, just like Taichi! -GHS
There was a twosome of petite girls,
Kiri and Miki.
They were eating the sweets they had just bought.
//I'm sure there's a double meaning for prostitution here that I can't see... -GHS

[Miki]
"Awww, then this buy'n'eat with you is the last, Kiri-chin!"

Sarcasm.
Kiri could not respond but with an insincere smile.

[Kiri]
"But I'll come around to play. I will, OK?"
//Literal because the two play together... or at least they should, given the only time they're together and Kiri's not spending the scene being pissed at Taichi are the pool scene, the beach scene in CCD3003, and that one bit at the end of the beach scene in CCA0027. -GHS

It was still the tail end of the heat.
//This does sound like it should be late in the year, but there's no need, see CCA0011C: it can just mean it's late in the day, in fact, around six o'clock. This could very well be July - right at the door of Summer break, after which Kiri will start at another school, and perfectly matching with the 1771 days passing as calculated in CCX0001. If that's not intentional, it's gotta be the luckiest coincidence ever. -GHS
The surface of the vanilla ice cream bars that the two were bringing to their mouths was already melting.
//That googles, though not to specifically that kind of ice cream. Well, as long as what girls are stuffing down their throats in chunks is some sort of sticky white stuff, its specific nature is irrelevant. -GHSecsiss

[Miki]
"Sooo nice. A normal school. Sooo nice."

And that is what she kept repeating, reproach in her tone of voice.
Kiri couldn't do anything but a forced smile.
It was because she did, in fact, feel apologetic.
On this occasion, Sakura Kiri's status had been certified as Recovered, and she will end up leaving the Gunjou Institute.
//...as if the authorities behind Gunjou would ever allow anyone to leave! Luckily this is metaphorical Heaven (i.e. she got admitted into the pearly gates and out of this purgatory), or this'd be the one thing that guarantees this whole script can't be real. -GHS
She had been declared as capable of conforming with society.
There will be discrimination, naturally,
because she had been branded at one time.
But Kiri decided to go.
//...of course, the point is to showcase how much she's changed, and finally got rid of her hypocrisy in her love for others. -GHS
It isn't that the reserves and ill feelings that exist deep in her heart had slackened.
She cannot assert to her present self, either.
//This reminds me of the folOling sentence: "barf of vanilla". -GHS
And still she will go.
//[bland quote about conquering fear] -GHS
That was something Miki could neither comprehend nor agree to.
And they had also fought about it.
It was their very first fight.
But Kiri will go.
This is the Flowers' Breakup Crisis.
//Oddly enough, here the possessive is correct. Well, its presence at least. -GHS
Miki began to always be in a dark mood,
Kiri began to be always stumped.
And then it came to a head here, the last day of her going to this school.
//In other words it's not Sunday. Although Kiri could just up and change schools mid-year, it being the last day of school before vacation better fits. In fact, see CCA0022: maybe they have their CC test 'round the last week before Summer break or so, which is how they know she's recovered. -GHS

[Kiri]
"But Miki, if you do your best, you can just leap on ahead somewhere!"

[Miki]
"Yeah... but mine is something I was born with more than some scar on the heart, so..."
//All of them have that thing like she does; some of them also have scars on their heart. The irony that Miki is, for all her mental issues, probably the most normal character in the VN, moreso than Tomoki and Sakuraba. -GHS
[Miki]
"I just gotta be with someone all the time you know!"
//This is closer to her ultramarine. And the one she was with wasn't Kiri; it was Taichi. Kiri was her Dragon. -GHS

She gnaws into the ice cream. Aggressively.
Miki is scary.
Kiri is terrified. Even if it's their last.
Miki does not want to leave Gunjou herself, either.
Just, the idea that Kiri would not be there is something she dislikes.
Kiri's comforting words,
and Miki's the true feelings,
were subtly misaligned.

[Kiri]
"Miki..."

Nervously flustered as she is,
all sorts of and all kinds of excuses swirl into an eddy.
//Symbols! Dunno of what. -GHS
This journey is a necessity for me but it's not
something more precious than your friendship Miki
it can't be compared but it's still so much of a
precious thing so I will want to foreeever be a
Pair with you therefore distance doesn't matter
yet proceeding forwards is something I absolutely
must do for I thought about so many things and I
remain unable to reach a conclusion but I prefer
moving onwards to stagnating in this condition so
now I'm bogged down in this quagmire where I
don't know how to make all this understandable to
someone else.
//This is the second-longest single sentence in the VN. Put this back together. Why did the devs even do everything ADV when it's obvious Tanaka's writing can't be broken up like that? Really. Quick return to first person, like above, for stylistic reasons, but quotes don't fit this. -GHS
And with those thoughts, Kiri's melting vanilla bar went riding her sweaty fingers and did a mock candle torture sex play onto the ground surface.
//Incredibly inappropriate sex reference + in particular a type of torture you'd expect in the Hasekura Mansion post-Shinkawas + candles (see CCA0012) = strong hints that Taichi is the narrator. And how does he know all this if he's not hanging around there? ...and if the explanation of why he loves candles isn't that they're bright and flicker (and he's near-blind and has low sensitivity to anything that isn't in motion), that may even be it. -GHS
In truth, she felt as if to cry.
//See CCA0012 again. Candles and then "it's to cry". Is he just writing this in his chuuni diary? -GHS
Looking at the face her companion was making, Miki gave a tiny laugh.

[Miki]
"But, well, your leaving to start a new life is still something to be happy about, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"!!!"

As Miki's civility improved, Kiri became flustered.
She ought be saying something sensible and tasteful now.
Nevertheless, her mind was blank.
Irresoluteness worthy of a soap opera.
And after great consideration, what she managed to squeeze out was,

[Kiri]
"...after all we'll always be a Pair."

Words with the whole might of her spirit.

[Kiri]
"Even if we separate."
//Because of quantum entanglement. I'm only sort-of kidding. I think. -GHS

[Miki]
"...yeah, I get it."

With the chin, she points to Kiri's ice cream.
That instant, the melting vanilla splits off from the stick and falls to the ground with a splat.
//Symbolism of uhmmm her taking thinking more seriously than eating sweets because uhmmm Miki likes sweets so she uhmmm, erm, ????????? I truly have nothing. Well, maybe her worries about Miki were still more important than sweets. But Kiri doesn't fatteningly love sweets, so, ??????? -GHS

[Miki]
"..."

[Kiri]
"..."
//... -GHS

The atmosphere flattened.
//Going with this due to the fact of loli. -GHS
And, right then,

[Taichi]
"...Gunjou... Broadcast Club..."

It came from the radio that was in Miki's breast pocket.
//And speaking of the fact that loli, she has both a card radio and the school ID as padding now. -GHS
She took it out in a panicky hurry.
The radio signal the rumors spoke of had come.
Miki plugged in the earphones, and handed over one to Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Is it...?"

[Miki]
"Yeah, it's Senpai."

It's a mysterious radio signal.
I started as a topic of discussion on the 'net, and it has now run throughout Japan, giving birth to all kinds of urban legends.
//"It also ended up overseas, but even in the late '10s most people in America still thought there was nothing there beyond tentacle rape due to the first-wave spread of the '90s, and so current trends like imouto and imouto and imouto went mostly ignored." -GHS

[Taichi]
"Today I think I will want to reminisce, and talk about the past."

It's Kurosu Taichi.

[Taichi]
"This is something I might have talked about long ago, maybe, I don't have the recollection..."
//MEMORY HUNTER. -GHS

There's no mistaking him.
Nothing of him was left but odd memories inside the hearts of the Broadcast Club members.

[Taichi]
"But I'm sure I have had to speak of this once."

He has neither run away nor has he ceased to exist.

[Taichi]
"Once upon a time, I committed a sin---"

There is not one single person who knows the truth.
//True, there are multiple ones. But if the truth was that he'd hallucinated every last thing then, no one the VN would, in fact, know the truth. -GHS
A boy, alone, that was as if a phantom.
//Living at the edge of society... sleeping at the hokora at night, building an antenna on the rooftop that he then tears up on the next day... -GHS

[Kiri]
"He's alive... no... he's... somewhere? But how?"

[Miki]
"He's... broadcasting!"

A Phantom Broadcast.
Hearing this in the flesh was the first time for both of them.

[Taichi]
"I made a friend of mine die..."

Taichi spoke.
It was the tale of a friend.
The story of a boy whom Taichi led to death.

[Kiri]
"..."

[Miki]
"..."

The two did not so much as stir until the broadcast had ended.
Before long, the interference of white noise erased the boy's voice.
//The specific word for what he interposes between him and the world. -GHS
As if released from a spell, the two sighed.

[Kiri]
"...was that...?"

[Miki]
"Yup... no mistake! It's... those club activities, I think."
//Wonder if Tanaka was in the eroge club. Wait, they have those in Japan, right? Anime can't lie. -GHS

[Kiri]
"In that town... with no one in it?"

[Miki]
"Maybe..."

[Kiri]
"Alone?"

[Miki]
"Maybe... well."

[Kiri]
"But is that... even possible?"
//I... don... 't... know... -GHS

[Miki]
"I think that's what Senpai was wishing for. To become alone."

[Kiri]
"But that's---! But that's..."

[Miki]
"Only his voice reaches us... it's sort of Senpai-ish. Right?"
//Yes, it's very Mr. Flip Dem Skirts to only have his voice reach. What the hell is she saying?! -GHS

There is world on the other side, and a world on this side.
//See CCA0002. -GHS
Somehow, Taichi had pushed the two back here.
And then he was having club activities, alone.

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Miki]
"So lonely."

[Kiri]
"Yup. And so sad."

[Miki]
"I wanna meet him."

[Kiri]
"I wanna meet him..."
//Still the same, meet vs. cross. -GHS

On this day of farewell for these close friends,
the two ended up being confronted by a parting in their past.

[Taichi]
"And that said, see you next week---"

The broadcast was brought to a finish with those words.

[Sakuraba]
"...hoh."

A road in the mountains, where he had stopped his bike to take a break,
//Moving part from below. -GHS
there sat Sakuraba, giving a little smile.
//Taichi turns up in the weirdest places. Adding 'sat' given the CG. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Ain't it been a while, buddy."

There was no way that the words could reach him,
yet Sakuraba put them to his mouth.
He does all he wants within the limits of becoming a nuisance, Mate-ing with anyone who catches his fancy.
//That could be either... -GHS
He had thought that Taichi had disappeared,
but today, he heard his voice.
You're living off somewhere aren't ya, thought Sakuraba.
His heart was with that satisfied, and he felt happy.

[Taichi]
"Zzz..."
[Taichi]
"Zzzzzz..."
[Taichi]
"Mnhyawhmnyawh..."
//FINAL TROLL! Well, except for Another Story and the Deus Ex Chaos Trial and uhm everything else. -GHS

[Misato]
(Peke-kun is asleep.)

[Sakuraba]
(So asleep.)

[Miki]
(His sleeping face is so cute isn't it.)
//This is what Taichi usually does to Misato. -GHS

[Kiri]
(If he's asleep... right?)

[Touko]
(Let's wake him up, you know, as revenge?)

[Tomoki]
(Do we even have that kind of right now... when I think what was done to us...)
//Could be positive, could be negative. This part is troll, to let less careful readers wonder if what Taichi did was just murder everyone and bury them at the hokora, so that they can never come back. That, however, would make absolutely no thematic sense whatsoever. Well, unless we consider "troll the less careful readers" to be a theme, and I guess we can at this point. -GHS

[Touko]
(That was surprising... really!)

[Miki]
(Buh-looo-dyyy)

[Kiri]
(Splatter.)

[Sakuraba]
(Bloody splatter.)

[Tomoki]
(...sorta like that, right)
//See beginning of CCX0001, where a nearly identical Miki-Kiri-Tomoki interaction happens. They're not reminding him of what he's done; they're teasing him. -GHS

[Touko]
(I wanna bring Taichi over to our side too.)

[Misato]
(But that... won't that be killing him?)
//The implication is that he needs to go through death to get there, confirming the metaphorical implication that they're in the equivalent of Heaven to Taichi's Earth. If he was just in the loop, death would just reset him. Hence, troll. -GHS

[Youko]
(...don't.)

[Touko]
(And Hasekura-senpai's overbearing pampering has begun.)
//She's so his urmoms. -GHS

[Youko]
(What you mustn't do you mustn't do.)

[Touko]
(Grrr.)

[Youko]
(Grrr.)

[Miki]
(Battle Commence!)
//Awww why didn't we get that... -GHS

[Misato]
(Come now, come now, this is just fine is it not?)

[Youko]
(Do be quiet, you'll wake him...)

[Kiri]
(Partiality... we got partiality here.)

[Miki]
(Because I've been partial to you, Kiri-chin.)

[Touko]
(The lesbian pair over there will be quieeet.)

[Miki]
(Gyaaah!)

[Tomoki]
(And we just ended up with an uproar didn't we...)
//This is still a replica of CCC3004. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
(But it seems we're alright)

[Misato]
(...Peke-kun is sleeping so soundly.)

[Kiri]
(I wonder if he's dreaming or something?)
//Cough. -GHS

[Miki]
(He's smiling.)

[Touko]
(Yes, he looks like he's having fun... isn't that good, Hasekura-senpai?)

[Youko]
(...yes...)

[Misato]
(I wanted to have a proper farewell, but... maybe we just cannot touch each other we cannot.)
//OTOH, this is as strong an implication that the guys are up there talking to him as he sleeps, but unable to do more. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
(Fare thee well.)
//See CCC3004, heh -GHS

[Tomoki]
(Bai bai.)

[Touko]
(You boys are too hasty! Really... well, bye Taichi.)

[Misato]
(Be in health.)

[Miki]
(Sayonara.)

[Kiri]
(Bon voyage.)

[Youko]
(...sob!)

[Misato]
(Do-, do not cry please!)

[Sakuraba]
(Take care of me.)

[Touko]
(Whyyy are you saying to take care of you!)

[Miki]
(Because he's next after him.)
//Rakugo expression for "I'm leaving the stage to the next person". Guess who's protagonist in the first segment of After Story! -GHS

[Kiri]
(...forced.)

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

I sit up.
I had felt a strange presence.

[Taichi]
"As if... the voices of everybody... were there..."

On the rooftop there's no presence of no sort.
//Part meta, part religious... part literally real. -GHS
It had all quietened down.
//Of course; they all left before he woke up. -GHS
The whispering of fairies maybe?
//Ah, there we go with Jintai... but nah, see On Fairy Stories. There's no more CARNAL ONLY here, there's also Marchen. -GHS
I'd say it was something more felt than actually heard.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm???"

I must've been half-awake.

[Taichi]
"Ah, well."

Back to sleep.
Seems I was just having a dream, I think.
//These actually lessen the impact of the troll, in a sense. But then again, there's enough troll here to last for a decade. -GHS
But I'm sure dreams are merely a poorly cobbled-together distortion that, I would dare say, makes the present world as it is, definitely.
//AKA the dreams are patchwork of his memories, as very visible at the beginning of CCX0001 - to which this part should be compared; all the stuff above was likely dream; and so's the world itself in which he is, which is fake. In the end, he actually kinda-said it. -GHS
To this myself who has released from his grasp the general concept of the self and the qualifications for dialog, it's the sole and only---
//And now we go back to even more troll: this only hints that everything, from the start, was nothing but his hallucination of solitude, instead of being a metaphor for proper distance (if kept with great difficulty and perhaps incomplete propriety), and for how personal isolation still allows great imagination, as after all correct for what boils down to be a story writer, or at least the representation of one (Tanaka). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Zzz."
[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"............"
[Taichi]
"...hahah."

"The hell... you guys doing..."

"Do it later..."

"............later..."
