And in the blink of an eye it became noon.
Naturally, with only eight people there's no readily coming across each other.
//Today he came across Kiri, Miki and Misato. Depending on the choices, also Sakuraba, Tomoki and Touko. What the hell is he even talking about? -GHS
Youko-chan's sandwiches...
There's kind of a lot of 'em.

[Taichi]
"Nothing I can do, I'll eat them alone I guess..."

I gotta eat something. It's my growth period.
//He's just growing progressively chuunier... -GHS
Suddenly, a shiver gives me goosebumps along my spine,
as if a soldier were targeting me from the back with a machine gun at the ready.

[Taichi]
"Yo-, Youko-chan..."

[Youko]
"......"

She stood.
She naught but stood.
Her approach of always.
Perhaps because of a predisposition to being sensitive to presences, this is something I can't get used to.
//...and chuunier. Wasn't he sensitive to motion, not presences? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Always out of a sudden innit."

[Youko]
"......"

I pinch her nose.

[Taichi]
"Talk!"

[Youko]
"I Dought Dat I was Deeded."
//Clamped nose. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

Thinking.

[Taichi]
"I don't really have anything I need you for."

[Youko]
"......"

In the chance given by my hand being released, she ends up escaping to about 2 meters away with a bounce.
Tsk.

[Taichi]
"That being said, eating a double portion alone, man what a problem."

I open the paper bag, and toss a 'wich in my mouth.
//Abbrev' FTW. Somehow. Also, plastic wrap and all??? ew -GHS

[Youko]
"............"

What kind of conflict could even be unfolding under that noh mask of a face?
//See CCA0018. Unrelated? Maybe... -GHS
Shortly after that, her shoulders drop a little.
In disheartenment.

[Youko]
"...I have vacated my apartment."
//See CCE0001. Computers and all? Bookcases welded to the damn ceiling with books??? Well, maybe she just means clothes and stuff. Or maybe this is still part of the very very very subtle increase in madness that's been going on ever since Youko began materializing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh, how come?"

[Youko]
"Going home."

[Taichi]
"Mine?"

Nod.

[Taichi]
"...not happening."

Begin rebuking.
//Unsure. "I start producing da-mes" and "soup bad horse? do" are both quality machine translator results. See CCC0006B. Damn annoying mothers who keep want to live with you when they should move out of their basements full of computers and books, amirite amirite. -GHS

[Youko]
"...but why?"

[Taichi]
"I'll be ill at ease."
//Hmmm, see CCA0020. Maybe that's why he can't settle down in the living room... -GHS

[Youko]
"Because there's no one anymore... I thought it would be best to live together as before..."
//She trying to imitate Touko in the last route? She has at least read the diaries, possibly seen it herself. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I think living all carefree on my own is better."

Opinions were split.
//It's a damn business meeting is what it is. -GHS
She makes a sour face as if she had bit into a bitterbug (Youko Edition/Nearly Expressionless).
//Just like Youko! I mean Youko. Er, Touko. I totally meant Youko from the start. -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi is so cruel to me all the time."

[Taichi]
"And you're excessively overprotective."

[Youko]
"I'm only doing what is normal, I think."

So she says, but is she now?

[Taichi]
"Regardless, not happening. I will be having my fill of living alone."

[Youko]
"......right."

Disheartened.
Giving a sidelong glance to this girl so immersed in Disheartenism, I chomp on a sandwich.
//Uhhh... symbolism? Not a real word, of course. I don't care, of course, since the madness of the Taichi is increasing. -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

Fixedly stared at.

[Youko]
"......"

Continuously stared at.

[Youko]
"............"

Stared at all the way to the end.
//See CCC0003B -GHS
That was Youko-chan's belly sound.
//How odd, no belly bug? Less odd: she has the same belly bug as Touko... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...lunch?"

[Youko]
"Did not have."

[Taichi]
"Oh, what a problem."

[Youko]
"However, earlier I heard words to the meaning that there's nothing you can do, and need to eat alone."

[Taichi]
"'Cause I said 'em."

Munch, munch, munch, munch.

[Taichi]
"And now, that is exactly what I am doing."

[Youko]
"...when there are two humans here."

[Taichi]
"Whatd'ja say? Something wasn't heard right?"
//"I didn't hear what you said" + "didn't you hear what I said dammit!" -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi bullies me straight away..."

[Taichi]
"Way delicious."

Munch, munch, munch, munch.

[Youko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Way really delicious."

Munch, munch, munch, munch.

[Youko]
"..."

The two of us loiter in a low-traffic corridor. Sounds audible are my chewing, Youko-chan's belly bug and the sandwiches being taken out of a paper bag. They work harmoniously to create a chord.
//"Impopular" corridor, not deserted, nothing else. Odd. Belly bug this time. More harmonics-oriented musical terms. -GHS
A tension I don't understand is swelling.
