"But if it's just about the packed lunch, then you can leave it on the table."

[Youko]
"Because, power plant... I couldn't go..."

[Taichi]
"The power plant? You couldn't go there?"

I don't understand what she means.
//According to Tanaka, there's no deeper meaning. It possibly just means she didn't want to leave Taichi for too long, given whether she resets is unclear as far back as this scene, even more so if she's about as real as Nanaka. However, considering that Sakuraba, True Mister Exposition, can reach it basically stumbling at random - while she can't - this might actually not be meaningless regardless of Tanaka's words. It's not like I don't trust his word; just that it has a lateral meaning even if it doesn't have a literal one. Meaning his words, in that context, were still true... just not the whole of it. -GHS

[Youko]
"......"

Fell silent.
Dammit.
Always doing the same thing, never talking beyond the summary.
She speaks only the absolute minimum words to let herself understand.
It's possible to press her on the issues, but if my questions and doubts are not formulated precisely it will still inevitably take a long time to reach understanding.
//Hey, just like Nanaka. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ehhh, in other words you went and checked it out? All the way out there?"
//See CCA0002. Could be up to a 12 hours walk, though that might be including getting lost and being a round trip. Could be as short as 3 hours. -GHS

[Youko]
"Because it was dangerous."
//Whether this is the reason she went or the reason she didn't go is unclear. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, I see..."

Certainly with the way things are the power plant would be dangerous.

[Taichi]
"So, you came here to report that."

Bob, she nods.

[Taichi]
"Well then... good job."

Bob, she nods.
Seems sort of happy.
I release her from my hand.
Her porcelain white cheeks swelled somewhat red.
Regardless,
she could not go, but what does that even mean?
The path was broken down by a landslide, maybe, that she couldn't physically make her way there at all.
//Man-tening the å´© -GHS
The terrain surrounding it can certainly satisfy the requirements for the purpose of the facility, but it's still veeery challenging land indeed.
But to definitely assert that it is safe... confirmation must be acquired.
//Yep, she goes away here still. -GHS
Hmmm.

[Taichi]
"Why could you not go?"

She was nowhere to be seen.
//Like Nanaka... -GHS
Gone, in the tiny gap I took my eyes off her.
//Theee Eeeyes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."
