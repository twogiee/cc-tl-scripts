[Taichi]
"OK then... let's go."

Let's just look at how things are, just a little bit.
From the look of it, this a friendly specter.
//CTRL+SHIFT+F-> Find what: Nanaka / Replace with: Casper -> Replace in Files -> OK -GHS
It doesn't seem like she's going to inflict me harm.

[Nanaka]
"I knew it, Taichi! You're so reasonable!"
//This should be obvious, but Nanaka's lines can often be read as replies to the Taichi's thoughts. -GHS

I creaked my thumb.
//The base joint, you know, with the rest of the hand. It's hard to explain without pictures of lolis, though a bit easier with normal pictures. -GHS
The two of us we walk up the mountain path.
For me, it was yesterday like today.
//This is like the first time that he's acknowledged that the day before was 'that' Sunday 6/9. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nanaka, you alright?"

[Nanaka]
"Ahhh, alright'alright! Physical strength's my pride!"
//She just pushing the bike with one hand, since she got the other clasped with Taichi? Maybe she dropped it. More likely, the disappearance ought be semi-suspicious, because at this point it's obvious Nanaka is a g-g-ghos-- waitasecAAAAUUUUGH *runs* -GHS

That's right, she doesn't have one drop of sweat on her.
She's in a sports club maybe.
//That may well have been. She wears buruma, after all. Not that it's relevant, but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"It was around here or thereabouts?"

[Nanaka]
"Bit further in."
[Nanaka]
"And, don't go carelessly into the bushes on the sides. There's some traps around."
//Which means it's in Nanaka's memories which means it's in Taichi's memories. Which means he no more forgets this than he forgot about Yutaka... or, given CCD0002, about Sakuraba. Also, the trap in front of the hokora must still be disarmed, though that's nothing but continuity since there's no way Miki would've reset it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Traps as in beast traps?"
//Heh. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Something like that. Disable them later, it's better."

[Taichi]
"...that's daaangerous."
[Taichi]
"Found it, found it!"
[Taichi]
"So, we came here, so next we---"

Nanaka wasn't anymore.

[Nanaka]
"Eh? Nanakaaa?"

[Taichi]
"Heeey, Nanakaaa!"
[Taichi]
"What in the what the hell. She deserted?"

I don't get this at all.
Anyway, I came to the hokora, but...
Guiding me up to the place and vanishing is kind of a hint, isn't it.
I should be investigating the hokora, then?

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."

Going to great lengths to come here then leaving without doing anything is just a waste, so I investigated.
Without taking things too seriously, I opened the hinged doors.
Notebooks, closely packed.

[Taichi]
"...whoooa."

I was astonished.
In this plain unadorned gloomy dim space, there was no monster, and no ancient jar nor dagger nor crystal ball, but...
//...not one previous thought at monsters or anything, but there he is, repeating the script unconsciously. -GHS
Notebooks, stacked up.
Student's notebooks of no unusuality.

[Taichi]
"..."

I took some out.
Carelessly, on the cover, a number is written with a magic marker.
Volume numbers maybe?
I try leafing through the notebook numbered 1.
...
......
............
I finished reading through from start to end.
//Doesn't he just read one? Except there's no way he can deduce the below from--- oh, screw it, it's a complete farce. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............huh?"
[Taichi]
"Eh, what's this?"

I put things in order in my head.

[Taichi]
"In short..."

1) There is one more personality in me that
   is writing on its own;
2) Something written by a future me has ended
   up here;
3) The same period of time is repeating over
   and over.

[Taichi]
"It's 3)... isn't it."
//Recollection hints continue... -GHS

Even if there's some other trick, regardless,
//This is why I'm a lolroffle hyperliteral translator, because if I had to adapt this to what it actually means, the above would be simply "COUGH HINT HINT COUGH" -GHS
in the first place, this is my handwriting.
//Odd he admits it NOW... several scripts after it was important. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The world's repeating itself, is that how it is?"
//Not true, but still literally correct. -GHS

Preposterous nonsense though it may be, explained like that it seems so correct.
//[obvious sherlock holmes quote] -GHS
I am thankful for my flexibility.
//"Let's not put the final word to this. The final word is a reflection from the final destination, and the process of reaching it is inevitably the process of a judgment." Worth quoting outright. -GHS
I can't connect this to the Fall of Mankind, but there's gotta be some kind of relation.

[Taichi]
"But..."

Looking at all these notebook, there's all this optimism in there, but...
//Remember the 'bad' ones are missing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Just, all of it, it all seems like of a hopeless struggle."

There's no recollections left by the rewinding,
so it's something like death, every time.
Just like that game, long ago.
//See CCC3013. That's the direct inspiration for this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

In an instant, I fell down into deep thought.
And then via many speculations and suspicions, I derived the truth of this situation.
//TL Note: Derived means remembered. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yup."

The inside of the hokora (and possibly the area around) might be exempt from the effect of the reset.
I tried investigating the area around the hokora for a short while,
but I came up with nothing.
//Not his footprints? No traps? Absurd. This is totally troll. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If I could easily understand this at a glance, where would the difficulty be?"

And there's Nanaka's existence,
and how she led me here.
//Still that likely dubious kokoni -GHS
Do I... know her?
Relying on the descriptions in the diaries, Nanaka appears every time.
As it's visible at a glance that she's not a person, that could be I guess.
I return the notebooks to the hokora.
It's best if it is like that.
Thousand will give you one that I even if I forget... Youko-chan can eventually reach the truth on her own power alone, definitely.
If she looks at the notebooks, she could likely reach in a single instant a final word of the same level as the one I, as I presently am, just thought up.

[Taichi]
"Ah... right, that uniform then."

Nanaka's uniform.
It's a design I have never seen.
It's not from a school around here (though there's one and only one on the other side of the mountain).
//Hum, but it's the same term as in CCA0002. Why would there be only one school on the other side of the mountain as well? It's a major city...? -GHS
Supposing there is a next encounter, then I'll go and interrogate her.
For the time being,
//Moved some stuff below. -GHS
For the time being, it is expected of me to write in the diary how I spend my everyday.
//Odd split. -GHS
Living onwards, leaving behind information.
That was what I thought.

[Taichi]
"However it goes, having fun's just fine then."

A rewinding world of solitude.
To me, that might yet just be an ideal place.
//See CCD0023 and the end of Miki's route, where it's hell. The difference? Here it's before he realizes it's all doom. -GHS
