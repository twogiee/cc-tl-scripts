"Ahhh, wait waiiit!"
//Same sentence Misato used along her invitations of Taichi. -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"I dare you to come play with me, right here, right now!"

Miki came to a halt.
Expectedly from her low XP status, her responses lack sharpness.

[Miki]
"...just... the two of us?"

[Taichi]
"That was unromantic way of saying it, yeah. In short, I'm inviting you to a date."

[Miki]
"Date."
//I hate dates. They are almost as horrifying as avocados... and I'm pretty sure avocados are evil. -GHS

Meaninglessly repeating my words.

[Taichi]
"We don't need no third wheels on a date. Better a tiny closed world of just the two of us."
//NOT 'sealed space'. -GHS

[Miki]
"I see..."

Seems like she's consenting due to being overwhelmed.
//She will NOT get out of her comfort zone without being pulled along, no more than a child will grow into an adult without some measure of effort to pull him along. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I won't take too much of your time now."
[Taichi]
"Or should I say, every once in a while Kiri would want some time to be alone, I'm sure."

[Miki]
"...yes, then..."

[Taichi]
"Good. Well then, let's head in the direction of your apartments and not return to school."
//HACK -redisplay doll +new doll -GHS

[Miki]
"...ah, but I want to go look at how she's doing..."

[Taichi]
"It's fiiine, it's fiiine."
//HACK Gnyamyeooow -GHS

[Miki]
"G'nyamyeooow!"
//Lo, they are combined once more! -GHS

I haul her away.
Once she sinks into depression, Miki as she is now will likely be unrecoverable.
//Though Kiri can... maybe. More hints that even Week 1 Miki was unlooping, since she had enough XP to show up throughout the week. -GHS
Brittle.
//Word usually used for Kiri. -GHS
But that's her being normal.
It's her being a normal girl.
Of course she's anxious. Kiri is here no more.
If I can get my hooks into her in this one week, if I can attract her affection, we'll be good.
She will return to her usual life.
But mere repatriation alone would be meaningless.
I have a need to obtain a little thing or two from her.
