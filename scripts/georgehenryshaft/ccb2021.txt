What could have happened?
//Sadly the previous script doesn't indicate much, but this is like Touko taking an arrow for Taichi, see CCB0023 when she doesn't jump to save him. -GHS
I cannot understand.
Just,
I was at the mercy of emotions that could not be analyzed.
???: "****?!"
//HACK All tags have been put to question marks in the console versions. The next one, for example, had to be necessarily Kiri. -GHS
???: "**..."
???: "*******"
???: "******..."
Interferences without number.
Cannot understand what is being said.
I move away.
I could not bear this.
I thought I had to distance myself from the interference.
I touch the fence.
With a push, the reticulate barrier is slowly removed.
The sky.
I was thinking that I wanted to go to the sky.
???: "******!!!"
A noticeably large interference approached from behind.
The world was clad in a brilliant scarlet color.
Color.
I did perceive the color known as 'brilliant scarlet'.
//He's just looking upwards as he's fallen down on the rooftop, having had an attack. -GHS
Wind in my ears.
Cutting through the air, I fly.

[Taichi]
"...hahah."

This isn't flying, I am falling.
//Toy Story was 1995, though that's probably stretching it. -GHS
And this isn't a comedy sketch either.
This is a real-life drop.
The finishing move of the Innocent Teenager, the Life Dive Appeal.
//The "appeal" here seems to be close enough to the English meaning. -GHS
It's not like I'm really trying to appeal all that much though...
Dammit.
Why did it even get to this point I don't know!
I want to start over, seriously!
Seriously.
About time for that crash, perhaps?
Craaap, if only I had someone next to me, then,
『As if gazing into a revolving lantern all my memories begin to flash in front of my eyes!』
//...though all this considered, this'd work just as fine literally. What's this but a revolving lantern that's about to make a full 360? Curiously the more common Japanese term is 走馬灯, this one is much more Chinese. Must be that Chinese mafia thing again... -GHS
is among the suitably cool Young Adult lines I could spout off while I would slowly close the eyes and give an excellent impression of an Honorable Man Among Men (the kind written with the kanji for 'China') so that making an appeal to the other side of the screen would be poss
//HACK fade to white afterwards, black looks really bad with the loop video. This originally just faded to white, but I'm assuming that's censorship of Taichi's jumper death. That or someone was a bit too trigger happy when implementing this graphical tweak in both endings. -GHS
