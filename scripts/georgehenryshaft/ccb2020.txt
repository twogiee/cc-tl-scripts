In the garden to prepare for cooking.
I wanted to eat rice.
Since I can't use the rice cooker (AKA Electron Jar), I cook it with camping utensils.
//Specified. Bit of trivia never hurts dem readers' closed mind. Haught! Notice the ever ambiguous "cannot use". Of course it means they don't work. Of course. -GHS
Here are instructions to cook delicious rice:
1) Believe in yourself.
2) Measure the rice.
3) The rice contains holy lives, grain by single
   grain.
4) On those countless lives people will live on.
5) However, all life will before long return to
   its home the earth.
6) The earth is alike life, and life is itself
   equal to the earth.
7) For the sake of someday creating new life---
8) Long form SF novel Gaia's Voyage 〜FIN〜
//It lasts only seven sentences and seems to be somewhat freaky. -GHS
 9) Polish the rice and let it soak in the water
    for about 20 minutes.
//Going by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_cooker#Cooking_rice_with_an_electric_rice_cooker as I believe he's just applying the steps to this (plus insanity) -GHS
10) I wanna rebel to this Summer season and eat
    some waaay hot curry!
11) Begin cooking.
12) As the gaze fixes straight on the flame,
    immerse yourself into a dangerous ideology or
    remember the comrades-in-arms who died to
    protect you (pick either).
//See CCA0012. -GHS
13) Once cooked, turn upside down and steam for
    about ten minutes.
//Unsure how he'd do this. -GHS
14) Seriously Delicious RAISU has here its
    explosive birth.

[Taichi]
"Done."

[Touko]
"...Taichi, I'm so glad... you were here."

Touko came around,
unease on her face.
Red in the corner of the eyes for some reason.

[Taichi]
"Oh, woken up have you."

[Touko]
"......nh."

Docile nod.
Approaching me, she wraps an arm around my neck from behind.
Squeeze.

[Touko]
"...well?"

Whispered in the ear.
Turning my neck, we kiss.
I immediately draw in her tongue...

[Touko]
"Pch... don't!"

She pulls her lips off mine.

[Touko]
"...at times like these, it's better if it's like pecking."

[Taichi]
"Uhhh-huh."

[Touko]
"So, let's redo. French kiss."

[Taichi]
"French kiss?"

[Touko]
"right?"

[Taichi]
"So then,"

Pchk.
Full strength from the beginning.

[Touko]
"!!!?"

Schlk, slchkchkh, pchrh, hRhrHnh, schlLLLLLLLL〜〜〜!
//ew るx7 -GHS
I tease (3P-style) her lips.
//嬲 See CCA0015 -GHS
I lure out her tongue with pchuukpchk.

[Touko]
"......"

Sexual urges arose.

[Taichi]
"...wanna?"

[Touko]
"Tha-, donn' have the streng'h for that!"

The way she articulated that was a little suspicious.

[Touko]
"...and I had just changed underwear..."

Whoa, she got wet just from that one?

[Touko]
"French... I even told you..."

[Taichi]
"And that's why we were doing a French Kiss right there."

[Touko]
"Eh... we were?"

[Taichi]
"Indeed. For a supremely deep entanglement of tongues while indecently gorging in wriggling and squirming as if the mouths were the partner's genitalia is what a French Kiss is."

* Exaggeration
//The console version is about starfishes. Thanks for the reminder of Yusa's mom's hands as well as a gratuitous Kinoko Nasu near-reference, Tanaka. That'll help. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And that is why the French Toast, for example, is also a most indecent food!"
//French Bread is fine, provided its Melted with Blood. Totally a reference... -GHS

[Touko]
"It can't, I used to always eat that..."

Shy blush.

[Touko]
"With caviar on top."

[Taichi]
"Let's just forget about the caviar."

[Touko]
"...what do you call a light kiss?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, just a soft kiss I guess."
//Tweaked due to language differences. -GHS

[Touko]
"Then, that one, let's."

[Taichi]
"Mh, it's fine."

Lips overlap,
with no mean intent.

[Touko]
"...nh."

The mood became sweet and sour.
//To better connect with the Young Adult Cadets and all that crap. -GHS
Because men directly connect this kind of mood to their libido, it is essential to know when to quit.
//See above, I guess. -GHS

[Touko]
"Nice smell."

[Taichi]
"Tummy is empty perhaps?"

[Touko]
"......yeah."

There is only a bit of embarrassment.
However much shyness, I thought, would not have been a problem.

[Taichi]
"So, let's eat."

[Touko]
"Amazing, it's rice!"

[Taichi]
"At least it's tastier than with the cooker at least... maybe."

The latest models of cookers have been very good after all.
//Criticism of older models of electric cookers? Remember it's 1998. Maybe this? "In the 1990s, China started-mass producing economical electrical rice cookers with limited functions and exporting them to many countries. Japanese makers have been attempting to compete by seeking a niche in models with added values by increasing the number of features of their products." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_cooker -GHS

[Taichi]
"Side dishes are retort pouch curry and canned food."

[Touko]
"Yes, it's fine."

The two of us eat.

[Touko]
"Ah, hot... hott't't!"

[Taichi]
"Cat's tongue yours."

[Touko]
"Tongue's weak..."

[Taichi]
"Definitely weak."

In many many ways.
Touko just puffs into a blush.
Rare that she doesn't have a retort.

[Taichi]
"As long as that weak spot remains, every time you kiss you will soil your underwear won't you."

[Touko]
"Ngh, ngh, nghhh〜"

Regret with spoon still in her mouth.
//Seems she tried to gulp down some curry to show him wrong and burned herself. -GHS

[Touko]
"...hFuh, blunder!"

[Taichi]
"Wahah!"

[Touko]
"...but delicious."

[Taichi]
"Retort pouch and canned food are no trifles."

[Touko]
"I told you... when you're eating with someone you like it's tasty. Whatever you're eating."

[Taichi]
"So it is."

[Touko]
"But I'd love it if we were like this forever."

[Taichi]
"..."

The evening wears on in silent stillness.
Without, truly, any sign of people.
