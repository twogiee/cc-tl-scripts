               And then, Sunday.
//Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS
HACK NVL mode, no dim -GHS
HACK Slow fade to black then fade to sky. -GHS
                   Rooftop.
               All preparations
                 are in order.
             ...or so we expected.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
HACK zoom'em in. -GHS
The antenna had been wrecked.

[Taichi]
"..."

For a moment I couldn't believe my eyes.
That thing that Senpai had put together with all her strength...
For a moment.
Immediately afterwards a thought split off from emotions,
so that I could indulge in that one thought calmly:
who did this?
In the world there are no more than 8 people.
No more than 8 people, yet...
//No more than. No! More! Than! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Senpai!"
//HACK not yet. Seriously, could this doll be less appropriate...? Ah, it could be a swimsuit doll. *thinks of making a swimsuit patch* -GHS

[Misato]
"......"

She was standing underfoot the wrecked spire.

[Taichi]
"Senpai?"
//HACK doll now. -GHS

[Misato]
"...!"

She turns around,
in a sharply high-strung manner.
My hand that expected to touch a shoulder cuts empty air.

[Misato]
"...Peke... kun."

Words that felt like they were shoving me away.
The heart creaks,
because I could glimpse the true intent loaded in her intonation.

[Tomoki]
"Taichi!"
[Tomoki]
"What happened here?"
//Look at this baldfaced liar! Or is he? -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"..."

The two had come together.

[Taichi]
"Beats me too."

Three sightlines turn to Senpai.
//HACK more distrusty Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"...it cannot be me can it now?"

So she answered in a shaking voice.

[Misato]
"...there are no people who would build something themselves, then tear it down themselves you know?"

[Taichi]
"Well."

There would have been people that act like that,
at the time when humanity was still in existence.
Well then?
Did Senpai wreck this by herself?
That possibility seems to exist.

[Tomoki]
"...Aneki, you tore this down by yourself didn't you?"
//HACK surprised Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh?"

[Tomoki]
"Because once it's completed, there's nowhere ahead to escape to."
[Tomoki]
"So you did this to return everything to 0 yourself."
//The real reason why Tomoki does this. Zero in number because round therefore a loop... though the font's a bit off for that. -GHS

Indeed.
That is something that can be.
Especially with Senpai. Because she's one of the ultramarines of Gunjou.
//The word 'human' will be seeing you later. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You created a way to escape so that you could still escape."

[Misato]
"Wait a second! Things might be somewhat like that but this..."

The iron door opens.
//HACK don't remove them here... -GHS
Conversation stops.
//HACK ...but here. -GHS

[Touko]
"...?"

It was Touko.

[Touko]
"...yuck, the three stooges."
//Nice consistency with her route, here. Budget problems? Eh, let's take it to mean the usual: plus ca change... -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Sakuraba]
"..."

Probably feeling that the lack of a reaction was strange, Touko came closer.

[Taichi]
"Why are you here?"
//See CCB2019. Yeeeah... -GHS

[Touko]
"Hasekura-senpai sent me a letter attached to an arrow, saying she needs to... talk to me."
//So she has a bow, at least. See CCA0027. -GHS

She looks up at the wrecked antenna.
//HACK surprised Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"It's... broken?"

[Taichi]
"It's been broken."
[Taichi]
"...by someone."

[Touko]
"Been broken... but who by?"

[Tomoki]
"Obvious."
[Tomoki]
"By someone who is here right now."
//HACK doll change moved up here -GHS

The gap between Touko's eyebrows grows tighter.

[Touko]
"But then..."

[Taichi]
"It's not a really pleasant story at all."

[Misato]
"It is not, not pleasant at all... that I would have broken it... cannot be..."
[Misato]
"It is... absolutely mistaken."

She mutters, grumbling.

[Taichi]
"This antenna was originally intended just for the Broadcast Club activities... but we were planning to use it to send an SOS signal."
//HACK Stay until Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh, you were?"

[Taichi]
"Is that right, Senpai?"

[Misato]
"...eh, ah, it is."

When the conversation turns towards her, Senpai grows a little bewildered.

[Misato]
"There was also that intent."

[Taichi]
"These were club activities as far as Senpai is concerned."
[Taichi]
"It can't be said it was entirely flight. Because there's also a destination."

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Therefore, I have no suspicions whatsoever regarding you, Senpai."
//...except he's lying. -GHS

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

[Taichi]
"Do not concern yourself too much about this."

[Misato]
"...yes."

[Touko]
"Wait, what are you whispering niceties in her ears under the cover of all this confusion!"
//Although I still want to read 耳触 (touching her ears) literally, because, well, Mimi-senpai. -GHS

[Taichi]
"To make her calm down of course."

[Touko]
"That's something that lovers would do you know!"
//And also because of this. This is likely the only reference to the Touko route, see CCB2019. -GHS

I shrug my shoulders.

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh, me and Senpai are what you would call Lovers of the Soul ~ Soul Rubber(s)!"
//"Soulful Love-Lovers" but... that doesn't sound too wrong or distinct. Gratuitous and totally off-tone Beatles reference instead, anyone? No one? Well then, Bueller. Harrumph. See CCA0027(?) -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Misato]
"..."

No one laughed, and there was no straight man retort either.
//See CCA0002. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

Lame.
I send eye signals to Touko.

[Taichi]
(Touko) (Touko) (Please!)
//See CCA0027. Once more, refuge in successful pattern repetition due to stressful situation. -GHS

[Touko]
"...eh? What? You're winking at me, what's wrong?"

Hyper obtuse.

[Taichi]
"Oh, whatever!"
//HACK angrier Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"What is it that you even have to get angry for now..."

[Taichi]
"Okay, culprit search stops here!"
//HACK split line, does look better like this. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Welll then, dear audience, here begins the Human Drama film of us fixing this interruption but quick and sending the SOS!"
//3xl. See you after the ads. -GHS

[Misato]
"...impossible."

[Taichi]
"Why!"

[Misato]
"Necessary equipment has been burned. Repairs cannot be performed."
//Going with a similar matter-of-fact tone as with CCA0016 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Burned you say..."
//Also see Tower of Friends. -GHS

She points at equipment right to her underfoot.
//HACK you just can tell the design of some scenes was rushed by the amount of default dolls thrown around tunelessly. That's likely why this scene clashes with the Touko route despite everything -GHS

[Misato]
"There is a smell like gasoline. It was doused then lit on fire."
//See CCZAS. Ohhh... -GHS

There were no words.
That thoroughness means...

[Taichi]
"Well, weeell even if we go after whoever did this, it won't change, that's what it means."

[Misato]
"I,"
//HACK oooh we're in trouble now. -GHS
[Misato]
"I do want to know who was it that did this."

[Taichi]
"Y...?"
//It's sorta a question now...? -GHS

[Misato]
"At the very least it ain't me. So in other words, it is one of you people is it not?"
//Shaken enough to drop a desu. -GHS

Words that resemble bullets.
Once fired, there is no taking them back.
Whether they miss, whether they wound.
But Misato-senpai's words well carried her understanding.

[Misato]
"One of you people betrayed us."

This was the bespectacled Senpai one would expect to be kind.
There are times when she did get angry, however,
I never thought she would make accusations.

[Tomoki]
"You... calling people TRAITORS!"

Tomoki shouts, suddenly.

[Tomoki]
"You of all people, saying even the word 'betrayal'---"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

In the instant Sakuraba moved, Tomoki was struck down.

[Sakuraba]
"..."

A punch?
From Sakuraba to Tomoki?

[Taichi]
"Come now, come now, come now, come now!"

I can't keep up with the developments.
//At least the trolls are clearly marked. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"OwChCh, whass'at for..."

[Sakuraba]
"...why did you destroy it?"

The words had been aimed at Tomoki.

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Did you say he destroyed it?"

[Sakuraba]
"Why did you even need to destroy it."
//Still not even questioning. -GHS

So said Sakuraba, seriously.

[Tomoki]
"...what are you talking about. I don't know anything!"

[Sakuraba]
"I saw it."
[Sakuraba]
"The moment when you smashed the antenna, I saw it."
//And he didn't act so far because...? And he saw it, when...? Divine revelation? Just guessing? Troll? Troll. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Misato]
"Tomoki, you..."

[Tomoki]
"......"

Tomoki's lips deformed unnaturally, and that very instant,
once again the door opens.
The sound is a high-pitched shrill that forms cracks into the silence.
It was Kiri with Miki.
And,
Kiri had a weapon.

[Kiri]
"Do not move!"

All stopped their movement. As if sewed into place.
//See CCB0013 -GHS
Kiri's hands held a crossbow, and it was loaded with a bolt.
//CROSS-bow, just not to forget why there's a weapon that unwieldy and useless, especially since there's a pretty decent probability at least someone around here would have a gun they could pillage. If only the police. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Move and I shoot. I warn you that this is not a toy."

It is as she says.
It's a Buckmaster Manufacture Maxpoint Crossbow.
//Actually Excalibur make, Buckmaster was the client. Doesn't seem that important. Can't source much information because it's well over a decade old and long discontinued. I can't conclusively find it being around 1998, but it was in 2002/2003 at the absolute very least of course, so it's the right one. -GHS
Crank cocking aid optional is installed.
//Should be the term. See CCC3025. -GHS
Is it woman spec then?
//Interesting how Taichi manages to recognize a rare odd model of crossbow with an uncommon attachment pretty much on sight. -GHS
That said, it's still a powerful weapon for hunting. Seems usable even without training. More than enough killing power.
//See CCC3007 -GHS
It perhaps was in somebody's house, I guess.
It is the defenselessness of a town characterized by many overnight millionaires.
//That's a curious thing to emphasize, if you think about it. After all, the town is uninhabited during the day, so her just stealing it wouldn't be a problem regardless of the presence of people. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"Kurosu Taichi in particular will not move!"
//Third person, colder -GHS
[Kiri]
"Because the one of you I would most extremely like to just accidentally kill would be you."

Mocking smile.

[Taichi]
"......(dear dear)"

[Touko]
"Really, what are you doing? I don't get this at all you know?"
[Touko]
"Calm down a little already, Sakura!"

As soon as Touko takes half one step out, the pointed end of the bow turned to the left by 15 degrees and put her in check.
//Bad at chess, Touko. Interesting use of 'pointed end', see Yutaka's fear of those things. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Do not move, please."

[Touko]
"Really! I have nothing to do with this I don't!"

[Kiri]
"But you do!"

Kiri shouts at the top of her voice towards all of us.

[Kiri]
"We are declaring independence."
//See CCA0015, CCA0015B, CCA0016. The metaphor is still countries, so maybe "secession" would be more precise. -GHS

Independence?

[Sakuraba]
"...which means?"

[Kiri]
"The borderline runs from the hill of the Kamisaka City Apartment Complex to the City Hall... therefore this is our possession."
//The City Hall is not on the map, though there's building that seems to be it. Should be the entire eastern part of the town: Miki and Kiri's houses, Gunjou, the shopping district of which Tasaki is at the top of, the Kirhara Estate... and the hokora. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Possessiooon?!"

[Kiri]
"All the food and water that is there, clothes and other miscellaneous goods naturally belong to our side."
//Sounds a bit off, but this is likely a well-rehearsed speech so it should sound unnatural. -GHS

[Touko]
"You mean monopolization?!"
//See CCB2015, but also CCB2102 and above. She has a... problem with monopolization. Or with sharing, rather. -GHS

[Kiri]
"That it is not."
[Kiri]
"Because grocery and miscellaneous stores do exist on the other side of the established national border."
//Again, stress on nations. Extremely important. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Approximately 30% or thereabouts."
[Kiri]
"It is an appropriate share."
//seven-ty percent they take, so, yes, it very much is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Appropriate, fine, I get it. But for what reason?"

Asking the question daunts Kiri.

[Kiri]
"Because we cannot trust you people."
//がたって. Look to Tomoki's response as well, this is all but a replay of CCB0006. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

[Kiri]
"Heading through Hounan Ward, in a grove just past the Sakai Bridge..."
//峰南町 is apparently in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himeji,_Hy%C5%8Dgo, Sakaibashi http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9D%82%E4%BA%95%E6%A9%8B%E9%A7%85 (just the station, damn railroad maniacs editing Wikipedia *random irrelevant grumbling*). There's no ward names on the city map, but I guess it refers to the south-western side of the town, where Sakuraba lives and where the City Hall may be. "Ward" is not exactly correct, but it's probably more recognizable. Sakai is the name of the bridge on the West of the map. See CCA0002 and CCA0004. -GHS
[Kiri]
"There was a corpse."

An impact runs through, voiceless.

[Taichi]
"Corpse..."

[Kiri]
"It was the body of an older person. Details were not ascertained."
//= "I didn't see anything, Miki just ran over to me and told me that just to hurry and get this done before the loop comes." See CCA0004 and more. Insistent, manipulation-oriented dishonesty. And given her Ultramarine is imitative behavior, generally of Taichi... -GHS

Sealing all questions with a concise explanation, Kiri pressed onwards.

[Kiri]
"The culprit is... among you, I conclude."

[Taichi]
"Ain't that just an extraordinary story."
//Going with "he takes this unseriously". Because he does. -GHS

[Kiri]
"And you... are the most suspicious!"

The crossbow turns towards me.
It felt that a bolt could fly out of it any moment.

[Kiri]
"You have a previous offense... you are therefore suspect number one!"
//Yutaka -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Previous offense...?"

A previous offense, have I.
That is very much true.
//She knows about Yutaka, but he's taking it as his thing about the Shinkawas. -GHS

[Kiri]
"And it could be someone else, there is the possibility."

Next to Kiri, Miki's face was looking down a little.
There's no indication that she will speak.
As if all she wanted was for this to be over soon.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, I totally got what your point is."
[Taichi]
"But all of us are in the same group of True Companions, the last survivors of mankind, and---"
//It will become more evident later that he really means that Nakama in the most trite Power Of Friendship way possible. -GHS

Kiri's words tore me to shreds.

[Kiri]
"I never thought we were close friends, not even once."

The rooftop chilled. Audibly.

[Tomoki]
"Well, isn't this a nice opportunity then."

Horribly calculated words.

[Tomoki]
"Because whatever we did, I never expected things to go well."
[Tomoki]
"I never even wanted to think of being on good terms with this guy here either."
//See CCA0029: guy's in love with him! Except, see CCD0002: not a good first start. Now see CCD1001: the two don't get quite well together. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Were you the one who broke the antenna?"

[Tomoki]
"Eh, well."
//Yes, it's *technically* a yes, and he's seen doing so in CCD1001. But that's no reason to not leave this unambiguous. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"Aneki was running away, that can't be allowed."

[Misato]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"If she steals refuges from others, she can be only one to run away, that's what she thinks."
//By severing his tendons she stole him from the sports he was taking refuge in. He was likely sent to Gunjou as a favor of sorts to his sister, so he couldn't even be away from her. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"If you're strict with others, then be strict with yourself too, 'K."
//See CCA0027 -GHS

Unemotional words,
but also spoken as if they were amicable.
//Hum, literally a parent's? That's totally what their mother would've said. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Independence. That's fine with me, Sakura."

[Kiri]
"...you people cannot be trusted."

[Sakuraba]
"We all OK with this, everyone?"

[Misato]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Tomoki]
"..."

[Miki]
"..."

[Taichi]
"..."

The usual of seven people.
It's something that should have been lost.
What was never anything more than the wreckage of friendships is, now, being completely destroyed.
Breakdown. Or disintegration.
It was there from the start, just, it was merely not seen.
//Ergo Week 1. -GHS
If every single one of us was acting in the role of friend then...
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
                 It was wrong.
            This, what I was seeing,
              was never my vision.
               What I was merely
             faintly expecting was,
                   mistaken.
//"Different" of course, but the "wrong" is very strong in this one. -GHS
                 Not like this.
              Not disintegration.
     Just those silly innocent afterschool
           activities, those I wanted.
//See CCA0030 -GHS
       Where was the mistake made, even.
     I think that, from the very beginning,
      everything had been one majestic and
              wonderful mistake.
           The existence known as me.
           The school known as Gunjou.
           The town known as Kamisaka.
        The grocery store known as Tasaki.
//The trolling known as Tanaka's Writing. -GHS
        The omnipotence known as the world.
//See CCX0001 -GHS
                  "Gone mad."
//Tag removed. See CCA0003. -GHS
          That was my tiny muttering.
            Dark black silhouettes
          dominate my field of vision.
//hmmm 黒 支... -GHS
        The shadow people are quarreling.
             I want to make it end.
           I want to make it all end.
        Even if all that remains now are
        dregs, the agony was unbearable.
        Once people were gone, I thought,
       the friction between people would be
                    no more.
       Then how can things be like this.
                Eight people,
        no more than eight people, and,
   there's conflict, perhaps reciprocal hate.
//Splitting it here, too much on the same screen otherwise -GHS
                   Of course.
               I knew the truth.
                  I realized,
              all is pointless if
                you're not alone.
              Plurality must not be.
            If one is not Individual,
           the person stays a person.
//See CCA0021 -GHS
                  Individual.
//One who looks at, uhm, a graveyard? I don't understand the visuals well enough here. -GHS
                  Individual.
                  Individual.
          Individual, but to become one...?
                 I felt dizzy.
//HACK pixelate back to this scene, ADV mode -GHS

[Miki]
"...kill, kill that one!"
//Almost certainly Taichi. Or Youko. Same. -GHS

Miki is shouting. I don't care anymore.

[Kiri]
"Miki?"

[Miki]
"Hurry, hurry, that one!"
[Miki]
"If you don't kill now...!"
//"...I'll kill you, Kiri" might be the response. -GHS

...I don't care anymore. Killing each other is fine.
Do as you like.
What was even this.
Yes, it's a kind world.
A kind world, I say.
It's a world filled to overflowing with compassion, where even a praying mantis dressed up as a human like me can be allowed to live.
And to make that real.
//Individuality...? -GHS
/The pixellated version's been left alone. It looks like crap when zoomed, of course. -GHS
...what do I do?
That is certain.
Things are in motion,
so with these eyes,
//KEY SENTENCE -GHS
in this world of motion or stillness nothing else,
I make the motion still.
I was thinking that, I definitely was.
I may have started walking without realizing, maybe.
*: "********"
Somebody's voice.
//Ha ha, voice file says it's Kiri. Possibly shouting as she decides to shoot? -GHS
Cannot understand what is being said.
*: "****!"
//Still Kiri. -GHS
Even just the who is incomprehensible.
And I look back.
