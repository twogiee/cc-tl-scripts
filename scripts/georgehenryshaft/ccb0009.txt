With a 'fwasah' I sweep my bangs.

[Taichi]
"Sorry for the interruption."

[Miki]

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes, Miki."

I stop.
I forgot to tell her something very important.

[Miki]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"I'm hearing that Club is going to be starting up again any time now."
//HACK doubty Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Club activities, you say?"

[Taichi]
"If your heart grows hard no matter what you do, please show face."
[Taichi]
"Because club activities exist just for that."

Slowly, understanding dawned on Miki's face.

[Miki]
"...yes!"

Something that was more than just happiness was mixed in that face.
