There is no one.
It feels like I haven't seen Touko at all these last few days.

"I know you can't really stomach it, but couldn't you try coming to Club starting tomorrow?"

And that's how my soliloquy goes.
If Youko had been among us, that's what I thought I would be telling her.
If we're going to play Pretend-an-Adolescence, it'd be best with all hands.
It's worthwhile to diarize in the diary today, too.
By the way, "diarize in the diary" ain't grammatically incorrect ya know.
//Song reference. Well, it's "to jot down in a diary in a diary", but redundancy's more of a grammar misdemeanor anyway. That's what they told me at the local PD Department when they released me on bail, at least. -GHS
Diary is a noun after all.
Interwoven with this and several other things that become picture frames, I continue with the scribbling.
* Become picture frames (sic). Correct is 'become
  erudition'. Taichi misunderstood the exact
  implication of "knowledge decorates the self like
  a frame decorates a picture".
//To the surprise of at this point no one, I can't actually source that as a real proverb. I'd wonder why, exactly, he's jotting down these silly and pointless notes in something no one will likely ever read, but somehow after writing that the fabric of the universe seems to have grown slightly weaker... -GHS
If possible, I would like to gather all hands on Sunday.
Ahhh, Sunday I can't diarize any record in the diary, no.
//Sure, 日記に記録 is different, but there's no way he doesn't mean this. -GHS
Still, that's one scene I would like to see at least once.
The reset might just be a very frightening phenomenon,
identical to death.
That's why... at the very least...

"Should I try inviting them..."

I head to the post office.
I go postal.
//I assert that this is a literal translation. -GHS
I plunder around thirty postcards.
//Hum, all I got is that postcard paper for inkjet printers is sold in packs of 30... -GHS
On the way back, I ostentatiously pass back and forth in front of the kouban.
//Bored policeman 1: "Oh, it's one of those weirdos." -GHS
While I'm there, I also assault the kouban.
//Bored policeman 2: "If he's not doing anything, just leave him do his thing, less trouble." (Console version censors this, but saying "I'll intrude on the kouban" is even more explicit!) -GHS
It was the first time I'd been inside one.
//See CCA0021. Notice a sign of something missing? And yet it should've been there since Monday unchanged. Clever clever. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, so thiiis is what the inside of a Kouban looks like."
//Bored policeman 1: "Yes indeed, yes indeed. Yeah, he's harmless." -GHS

Are there handguns here I wonder.
//Bored policeman 2: "They're in a safe of course." -GHS
There were handcuffs.
//Bored Policeman 1: "Hands off those, please." -GHS
There were no other valuables.

[Taichi]
"Cut it out now."
//Bored policeman 2: "Good evening to you too, I guess." Bored policeman 1: "...all kinds around here, all kinds..." -GHS

I don't have time to do this kind of stuff.
//It's just rubbed into people's faces, really. -GHS
I hurry back home.
I write the postcards.

[Taichi]
"And then now..."

This way, and that way.
A busy night we will have here.
//He just dumps 'em in the post, doesn't he. And it's like 5PM anyway. -GHS
