Miki graced us with her presence.
//oddly formal -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come ooon, you freshman over there!"
//...see CCA0002? I wonder if there's a scene cut where she sneaks up on Taichi. That'd be copyright-wise dangerous... -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, a properly-clothed Senpai."

[Taichi]
"G'fuh!"

[Miki]
"The pee-pee isn't in public anymore, is it... that's good!"
//Sort-of similar to CCC3018 but slightly less cutesy. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Speak not of my pee-pee!"
[Taichi]
"And why it was exposed I still don't know."

[Miki]
"............"

Mysteriously, she keeps silent.

[Taichi]
"More importantly, what's that cardboard box?"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, I thought I'd play around with this a bit... but I've been found out, nothing I can do."
//もう人遊び mou hito asobi doesn't seem to have a special meaning, but 毛皮 mouhi, fur, hmmm. -GHS
[Miki]
"This is the Miki House."
//You'd think there should be a link to http://disney.com do you? Well, look below... -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Can we do this?"
//Not in the console version, where poor Miki gets her nose repeatedly pinched to get her to not say the name. -GHS

[Miki]
"What's wrong with it?"

[Taichi]
"Well... all sorts of things..."

[Miki]
"It's the house of Miki therefore Miki House. Are there any problems with that?"

Well, if she says so, but...

[Miki]
"It's used to remain undiscovered during mobilizations in hostile territory."
//Metal Gear Solid was released September 3, 1998. Juuust in time. See CCD0008B for why it's certainly the reference. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ain't gonna work."

[Miki]
"You sure?"

[Taichi]
"On sight of the Miki House, a normal Young Adult will dandy up and with a, 'could there be some quality children's clothing inside?', decide to peek into it."
//http://www.mikihouse.co.jp/en/ and the arcana is solved. Please note that they don't ship internationally even though their site is in English (I think it's Japanese for "use a forwarding service"). Ah, wait, there's a USA site now: http://mikihouse-usa.com/ -GHS

[Miki]
"...ngh, and it's impossible to sell something that I've already worn, isn't it."
//I think we're switching from the box to the clothes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How much is it?"

[Miki]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"How much should I pay for it?"

[Miki]
"Why are you saying this making this very Real Serious face all of a sudden?"
//The Rial is also a currency. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because it's a Real-Life Generation. But, that is inconsequential."
[Taichi]
"How much?"

[Miki]
"Hmmm, weeell nooow."

She makes a mischievous face that is so much like a little demonic imp's.

[Miki]
"Well, complete set's a million yen. Buyout price. However, it's limited time sale. If you can pay now, I will strip on the spot and hand all over, no problem. Outside of this, nooot happening."

I hand over ten of the gold coins I received from Sakuraba.
//Now he has 635,000 yen left, 6+3+5=7x2. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bought. Impulse buy."
//See CCA0007. Has this guy ever had money...? -GHS

[Miki]
"............eah?"

Miki's expression freezes having shot off a questioning mumble that sounds like a literal translation of the Japanese word 'kuuki'.
//cookies, where??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I desire you to strip on the spot."
[Taichi]
"Too bad there's no worn-on-model shot for demonstration, but at least the stripping scene will be photographed for sure!"
//He intends to auction them, see CCC0003A -GHS

I set up the camera. Good thing we're in the club room.
There's still enough battery charge left, great.

[Miki]
"......ah, uhm... what're these?"

[Taichi]
"Ten thousand yen gold coins. You likely don't know about them, Miki."
[Taichi]
"The Showa Era was an era of war, an era of progress, an era of being hated by the world that lasted for more than 60 years."

[Miki]
"Are these spendable?"

[Taichi]
"That they're not, but, well, they're still officially currency."
//I suspect banks would have relatively little issue exchanging a gold coin, but indeed I don't think shops would accept them. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That was an impulse buy after all. So, the money due was given. Next it's your end of the bargain."

[Miki]
"Hyh..."

Terror.

[Taichi]
"Supposing you were to alter the deal... I would give you a rating of 'Very Negative'!"
//Not the translation, but dammit, it's Star Wars meets Ebay, and I can't pass that up. Or think of a midichlorians joke, dammit. -GHS

[Miki]
"But for a girl, to have that on her shoulders is to be in a pinch among pinches!"

[Taichi]
"Ergo gladden me with stripping."

[Miki]
"Ah, aWaaah, fwah... it-, it's just..."

[Kiri]
"Please wait!"

It was Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Ngh, you're Kiri!"
//You are the Sleuth, Sir Lock. -GHS

I'll be kicked.
I guard my head,
but,

[Kiri]
"...I... I will strip in her place!"
//Compare CCC3027 and contrast, again, CCC3018. Miki'll gladly leave Kiri to die. -GHS

[Both]
"EHHHHHHHHHH?!?"

Kiri puts her hands under the skirt, and sliiides her underwear down.

[Kiri]
"Sob..."

[Taichi]
"Okieh okieh, 's enough, 's enough! I don't really want you to!"
//See CCA0030. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"I don't have the hobby of making the ladies cry."
//No kiss the girls and make them cry? -GHS

Now, if we were alone...
//See CCC3027. -GHS

[Miki]
"Thaaanks, Kiricchiii!"
//This is the absolute first time the "Kiri happy" doll is seen. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Miki! So glad you're safe!"

Hug!,
and the two hug.
//I believe they do so huggingly. -GHS
...I'm just the bad guy in this world, am I.
