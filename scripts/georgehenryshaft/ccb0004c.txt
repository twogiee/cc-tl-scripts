"Got here early dinn'cha."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And yet you came to school in normal clothes again?"

School regulations in Gunjou are next to ignorable.
If a problem arises, the guards intervene.
There is no need for students to regulate, judge, or decide for themselves.
//expanding. -GHS
Therefore, the regulatory standard mandating the use of uniforms is entirely ignorable.
In this lone Gunjou under the heavens, to force a girl of that age back into the uniform she took off is hopeless beyond all effort.
//See CCA0013. -GHS
She does it to cut herself off from other people.
That was Touko's unshakable, unmistakable resistance.

[Taichi]
"I wannya see you in moe-moe uniform clothes, nya〜n!"
//Intentional brick through the window of the mood. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

Yee-ep.
A character that looks so good while ignoring this much is rare.
The more Touko stays just like this, the more like a picture she becomes.
//See CCA0014B, CCA0023, the fact that this is a CG -GHS
I sat her neighbor, and motionlessly gazed at her profile.
Insatiably, for a long time.
//See CCA0010 -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"........."

[Touko]
"........."

[Taichi]
"...................................."
//They are naturally counted precisely. Needless to say, really. -GHS

[Touko]
"...what do you even want!"

The rage shoots upwards.

[Taichi]
"Come on, paintings should not be talking."

[Touko]
"What's that even mean?!"

[Taichi]
"Be beautiful."

[Touko]
"I don't get you at all!"

[Taichi]
"You always drop in affectations like 'shan't' or 'mayhap' that stink of grandmother, so don't talk too much or your image will crumble."
//Intentionally literal for imagery. FWIW, she'll use a 〜だわ in CCD2002, and the only 〜ですわ so far was in his hallucination in CCA0002 (plus the one below). -GHS

[Touko]
"WHAASSS'D YOU SAAAAID?!?"
//lisp + angrish = plausibility (or at least plausible deniability) -GHS

It's deeead.
She actually uttered "whas'd you said".
This is the demise of a work of fine arts.

[Taichi]
"Awww, whatta killjoy."

I made display of a shrug similar to that of an American that fears himself thoroughly eradicated alongside the coercive concept known as the righteousness of the world.
//This doesn't make much sense...? PS2 version calls it simply "exaggerated". -GHS

[Taichi]
"I bestow you the second name of, Destroyer of Arts."

[Touko]
"Do not want it!!!"
//See below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's to be happy, too. Picasso himself was called the same. No finer thing on the same level as it."
//http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1988/06/picasso-creator-and-destroyer/305715/?single_page=true as far as I could find this is the only instance. -GHS

[Touko]
"DO!!! NOT!!! WANT!!! IT!!!"
//Fits juuust right. -GHS

I whistle.

[Taichi]
"Giving a fright shan't we〜!"

[Touko]
"I do not say 'shan't' you know!!!"

[Taichi]
"Don't just use sets of three exclamation marks!"
//Adapted because two exclamation marks don't look right in English. This is true because of the following: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, whereas !=what I said is true. -GHS

[Touko]
"What sort of remonstration is that even meant to be!!!"

[Taichi]
"Pffft heheheheh..."

[Touko]
"You making fun of me?! You making fun of me! YOU MAKING FUUUUUUN!!!"

Ignition complete.

[Touko]
"Isn't a normal conversation proof of friendship? Aren't you always approaching with the goal of making people look stupid! You're so stupid so how dare you make me look stupid! I can't believe it I don't want to believe it I don't want to be be made to believe it!"
//wooo made it fit somehow -GHS

[Taichi]
"Look who's burning."
//vs. 'yoku iu' -GHS

You are really the best.

[Touko]
"○×△□＄＃％＆○×△□＄＃％＆!!!!!!!!"
//Unfortunately, the audio file seems too compressed to recover. -GHS

Spellbound I lend my ear to listen closely.
Touko's right hand had grown blurry.
Wha--?!
//HACK HUNGRY HARAKIRI WOLF -GHS
HACK independent CG shake -GHS
Ker-smack!!!

[Taichi]
"G'fuh!"

Sudden palm strike.
Strike-induced fall.
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS
A grand, magnificent fall that drags in even unoccupied chairs and desks.

[Taichi]
"OwChChCh."
[Taichi]
"As is to be expected of the 『Close Quarters Hand-to-hand Combat Technique * Harakiri Fist』, no openings."

[Touko]
"Besides, pipparly people like you guys should live in a different world from me! Me being here is wrong, and you people being near me is also wrong!"

* Pipparly = Toukese for dullard.
//I don't think there's an official explanation for this at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't all those mean the same thing?"

[Touko]
"'addap!"
//Lisp -GHS

[Taichi]
"The hysteria of non-virgins is truly a difficult sight!"
//hard to see + ugly (both minikui) -GHS

[Touko]
"?!?"

Her face cramped.

[Touko]
"Y-, y-, y-... you've really... said... that?"

[Taichi]
"Is it a problem perhaps?"
//Making fun of her. -GHS

I pick at some earwax while playing dumb.
//See CCA0027 -GHS

[Touko]
"It's not a 'problem'..."

In a lowering tone of voice.

[Touko]
"That is just... on a dimension of vulgarity that surpasses..."
//Parallel, of course. -GHS

Slowly raising her face.

[Touko]
"GET OUUUUUUUUT!!!"
//See CCD0008B. With the one in the 'ke', that's 8 'e'. -GHS

Oh joyous forceful expulsion.
//her and him -GHS
