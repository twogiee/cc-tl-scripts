"So, cleaning, can I help you?"

Miki gives a broad smile.

[Miki]
"I decline."

[Taichi]
"BWAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
//total 7x2 letters. -GHS

Rejected!
No technique, no pity, not one slice of sympathy.

[Miki]
"Senpai, blood and those things are your weakness, right?"
//Requires adapting the 'to ka' because it's also the sunset, and the red paint, and... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh, well, I guess it is, sure..."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

How does she know?
A dark suspicion presented itself.
//HACK normal screen -GHS
In 0.5" it was beaten back to the hell it came from.
//Or the theater basement, apparently there's no difference. ...man, the Japanese must really hate lesb--thespians. -GHS
This is Miki dammit.
My most cherished, valued... Flower, yes.

[Miki]
"Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"True, indeed. Blood's my weakness, indeed."

[Miki]
"It's not blood, but there's paint that got scattered all around, I would say."
//See below. -GHS
[Miki]
"That is why cleaning's already a bother right now, I would say."
//See below. -GHS
[Miki]
"Furthermore, with this short skirt my panties are visible when I bend over, so I would have to deal with an aroused Senpai which would make it an even bigger bother, I would say."
//See below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Quite plausible, I would say."
//See below. -GHS

A very straightforward manner of speaking.
I like it.

[Taichi]
"This certainly looks like some work, I would say."
//See below. -GHS

[Miki]
"I've infected you!"
//There you go. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This certainly looks like some work, innit. Cough."
//PCP above -GHS

[Miki]
"Sah!"

Saluted.

[Taichi]
"Are you going nom-nom on those meals?"

[Miki]
"Sah, most certainly I am."
//See CCA0021 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Therefore in a most mature manner I bow out, and from now on provide indirect support to my pupil by watching over her in great secret!"
//HACK beaming Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Sah, I am very thankful for that!"
