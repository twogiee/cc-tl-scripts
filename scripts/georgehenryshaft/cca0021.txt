*Bom* *Bem* *Bam* *Bom*
//These are NOT The Chimes of the Big Ben. That's an episode of The Prisoner, dammit! Not impossible they are the chimes of class beginning, however, and they're conveniently covered up by their hammerin'. Whether it's Week 1 trollage or the mere reality. -GHS
This morning too, on the rooftop, club activities were proceeding strenuously.

[Taichi]
"YOU THEEEERE!!!"
//Angry. -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh, what?!"

I thunder out at Senpai on top of the ladder steps, and with a
baplump!
//soff' -GHS
she fell down.
//See CCA0013. Same pattern as the description of Yusa's snot bridge. -GHS

[Misato]
"AwChChChCh!"

[Taichi]
"There is safety in silence! Remember, the pheasant would have lived but for its cry."
//Accepted translation of the proverb. Mixes well with the Grateful Crane in CCD1001. -GHS

[Misato]
"I-, I am not making animal calls here!"

[Taichi]
"HEI, MISU injured person. HOWAI WAZU ITTO NAU?" (Hey, Miss injured person! Why are you already at work?)

The meaning and that stuff are whatever. This here is about sensitivity.
//Which is why he speaks in Engrish and totally not because he doesn't know English. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ngh..."
//This is the correct response, BTW. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Especially in that period of time when your worthless servant isn't there!"

[Misato]
"It's-, it's not like I was trying to be all sneaky... I was just very anxious. This morning I was awake at five."
//going with first part being less formal-ish. -GHS

So Senpai explained, adding full-extent gesticulation to improve the excuse.
//This is a characterization that didn't quite get used, unfortunately. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you're a traitor."

[Misato]
"I-, I am not!"
//She's taking it well, considering. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awwwnh, so heartless ain'tcha Misato-senpai!"

[Misato]
"Ahhh, but I told you..."
[Misato]
"Fine, I accept my defeat. I am sorry."

She brought up both hands.

[Taichi]
"Suspect apprehended in flagrante delicto at seven-fifty AM."
//This gives a timeline for when people generally gather on the rooftop. -GHS

[Misato]
"Yee-es!♪"

She extends both hands forwards.
And on those wrists,
Clack! Snap!
//Following audible SFX as I don't see anything here (oddly enough) -GHS

[Misato]
"...eh?"

Ah, dammit... unconscious me.

[Misato]
"What are... these?"

[Taichi]
"Handcuffs..."

[Misato]
"Toys, of course?"

[Taichi]
"Real..."

Silence.

[Misato]
"Wh-, wh-wh-wh-why would you even have the genuine article with you?"

[Taichi]
"Th-, th-th-th-the police box was empty and handcuffs fell on the floor and so I brought them with..."
//The koban is around the train station which is waaay out of his path to school. Hum, 4 stutters of hers and 3 of his. -GHS

[Misato]
"Seriously... heheh, well, it is just the way you are♪."

Tsun-tsun.
//As expected of today's onii-chan, such technical terms are いろいろ funny/interesting, etc. and it can't be helped so I stick my brobdingnagian meat poleaxe in such a small honeypot? So. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahahah, sooo-ry!"
//one R -GHS

Smile x2.

[Misato]
"The key?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, the key then... yes... the key, where could it possibly ever be...?"

Her smile fixes fast.
//Because Fixation. But it means hardening. -GHS

[Misato]
"Uhmmm."
[Misato]
"Ahahah!"

She laughed.

[Misato]
"Apologies, Peke-kun. It is as if I heard you just now wonder where the key could possibly be."

[Taichi]
"That is because I said that."

She became expressionless.

[Misato]
"Right now, you stand in a position where you could not utter a word of complaint even if I were to violently assault you."

[Taichi]
"De-, depending on what that means that is Most OK!"
//-desu. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Hy'ghyah!"

Attacked.

[Misato]
"Why... did you do something this careless..."

[Taichi]
"Uhm, via conditioned reflexes..."
//He's still not kidding! -GHS

[Misato]
"These cannot be removed without the key, can they nooow?"

[Taichi]
"Come now, come now! I will just search for the key, yes?"

[Misato]
"...will it even be at that police box?"

[Taichi]
"Yes of course! I will go look for it when I go back home!"

[Misato]
"You mean you will be going now. Right?"

GrytGrytGryt...
//Giri-giri. See CCC0016A, but given the SFX, works better uhmmm let's say literally. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hyesh... IMMEDIATELY!"

While in the grip of 『Burst!! * Double Iron Claw』, there exists no space for other answers.
//Now it's a superpower. See CCD2002 for when he'll use it, though admittedly Touko has one as well, see CCB2019. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But until I return please stay calm!"

[Misato]
"I cannot even change clothes like this!"
//This is probably the third night in a row she stayed over. -GHS

[Taichi]
"For now, how about going into a classroom?"

[Misato]
"I should, yes..."
//...why wouldn't she stay there? This IS odd. -GHS

We both return inside the school building.

[Misato]
"But it would be best if we are not found by anybody..."

[Taichi]
"How come?"

[Misato]
"Will it not look like that I am being frog-marched!"

[Taichi]
"If I have to say what it is, you look like you are doing a Playact."

[Misato]
"Play...?"

[Taichi]
"Your class was on the third floor, right, Senpai?"
//This is never changed in any edition, but it's odd, see CCD0011B: the first years' class is on the fourth floor. The layout of Gunjou is never really clarified, however. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, it is over there!"

Over there Miki had appeared.

[Miki]
"G'morning!"

[Misato]
"!!!?!?"

Senpai attempted to hide the top of her hands and, flustered, failed in the act.
The towel that covered her wrists falls gently to the floor.
It would have been better if she had just sat still...

[Miki]
"..."
[Miki]
"Y-, you were arrested..."

Misato "I was not! This is just a prank!"

[Miki]
"..."
[Miki]
"Uhm, Senpai."

She gave a military salute.

[Taichi]
"What's all this then, Constable Yamanobe?"
//It's actually a 1931 law in England for all bobbies to start every sentence that way. -GHS

[Miki]
"Sah! Today the infirmary appears to be vacant!"

Bowing, she presents us a place to have our little sex playact.
//Maybe too explicit, but that's Miki's intent anyway. -GHS
Ngh, what a nice gal...

[Misato]
"?"

Naive Senpai can't understand.

[Taichi]
"Myyy, thank you. Wanna join us?"

[Miki]
"Sah! I am thinking about living on as a virgin for a little longer, perhaps, ergo..."

[Taichi]
"That is too bad. Well then."

[Miki]
"Thank you very much for everything!"
//I still think this reads closer to a *literal* "your business is much appreciated". -GHS

With a snappy bow of the head, she saw off this innocent young boy and his Senpai.

[Misato]
"I did not really understand that conversation now."

[Taichi]
"It'd be a big mess if ya got that."
//Form's Kansai-ben. -GHS

[Misato]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Well then."

The front of the train station.
//North-northwestern part of Kamisaka, somewhat close to where Miki lives, near Atomic GS. -GHS
Despite how it normally is in most parts of Japan, this place is a small and cozy thing.
//Reminder as the front of the station is normally a popular, not seedy, spot in Japan. -GHS
Not being squalid nor messy is its grace.
And the police box is... right nearby.
A notice is up outside that says 'on patrol', and no one is inside.
//Remember this insignificant irrelevant detail well. -GHS
I spotted the key immediately.
//Not yet grabbed it, though -GHS
Is this still stealing, I wonder?
//Suspiciously girly. -GHS
I choose for it to be.
And of office supplies, as well.
The final dastardly criminal act of the King of Misdemeanors, Arsene Taichi.
//See CCB2009 for more, and CCD0004 for Fujiko. No accents in Shit-JIS (sic?). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mine."
//grabs keys, to contrast with how he just saw it earlier. -GHS

Gotta go back immediately, right.
There is no pedestrian traffic in front of the train station.
From the very beginning the bustle of this station, this only real access point between the City and this residential area, had been thin.
//Sometimes I wonder how people manage not to see this stuff being rubbed in their faces. -GHS
The inorganic asphalt that makes up this plaza gives rise to a faint shimmer of heat haze.
Not a single car in sight either.
//It's work day in a dormitory town. Of course it's totally deserted. -GHS
That is why I was walking straight in the middle of the road.

[Taichi]
"..."

There is no one here that'd rebuke me for that.
//He's not alone though, Youko is watching. -GHS
But would it, really.
//This is totally where he starts convincing himself he lives in a world of no humans. -GHS
For example, in a world like this,
no matter what crime one has had stained their
hands with, if no one rebukes you, then there
will be no being rebuked at all.
//Very careful here, he does not say that a world without people to call things crimes there'd be no crime. He says that without anyone to call on crimes, there'd be nothing CALLED a crime. Remember how he decides he is still stealing from the kouban. Consider Misato vs. her father: there's a higher law than the one of men, that won't pass or miss anything even if the law of men does. -GHS
It's a world of lawlessness.
//See CCA0007, CCC3007 -GHS
But still, here, there is only myself.
In a world of only myself, what crime even exists?
None.
If there are no points of tangent with people, then the majority of offenses disperse and loses meaning.
//That's actually nonsense even from the Nietzscheian standpoint. If all are construct of the interaction between people, what offenses remain when no one's left? Taichi's failing the basics here. OTOH, considering the Ten Commandments, only four remain if there's no people, so it'd be correct in that sense... -GHS
It's ideal.
//However, the point of this thing isn't so much lawlessness vs. morality, which Taichi's too dumb to discuss anyway, but it's simply addressing and piquing the curiosity of loners and hikikomori. -GHS
It could be said it's an ideal society.
Being Individual. An abandonment of the flock.
//群 gun same as in 'gunjou'. -GHS
What strength would be necessary for that?
//See CCC3025, Youko in particular. Is he inventing the character even here? At times I do wonder. The point is more of a warning to hikikomori; most of them have zero chance of actually surviving in that environment, hence suicide rates. And if Cross Channel has a 'message', it's anti-suicide. -GHS
And more, what kind of intrapsychical structure
would be suitable to be in it?
Humans have many appetites, many lusts.
//This is one of two somewhat-recurring terms... -GHS
They exist on a level different from mere wishes,
such as wanting to drink water.
//...and this is the other. -GHS
What appetites, what lusts? What desires?
//That's the actual term I'll use, but since the original means all this, and it's an explanation, putting 'em all in. -GHS
Career. Worldly success.
Knowledge. Intellectuality.
Creation. Creativity.
Conquest. Overcoming.
//Same as with CCA0016 -GHS
Those are things held towards others, or things
with a value constructed via others.
A desire then may just be, perhaps, the
manifestation of a want to obtain the approval
and recognition of others.
Wanting more possessions than other people.
Wanting to have more knowledge than other people.
Wanting more success than other people.
Others stand as prerequisite.
The principle of desire lies in the acquisition of
that which many other people confer value to.
One of its most definite forms has to be...
currency, I guess.
It is what people want even if they have
no goal they need it for in their immediate.
When humans live together with desires, it's in
a world already stained by the consciousness and
the sense of values of others, that their
personality is itself by those molded and shaped.
//This is fairly basic stuff so I don't think I need to further comment on it. Well, let's just say that if this confuses you, then you either jumped into this at this point, or you've long given up. -GHS
Well then, what if he was truly Individual.
How would the essence of his desires even alter?
No, the instant others are no more, desire loses
its very definition until it has become
a mere want.
A horse race with no competing horses does not
become a true contest, consequently the goal of
fastest speed will no longer be pursued.
In a world of their own self alone, how many
people will still want to be intellectuals?
//"How many will desire to remain intellectual if they are all living individually separate from others", not necessarily "how big is the intellectual class if one person alone exists in the world". Since this is for the former, not the latter, though the troll is still present. -GHS
Could these people continue the act of creation
when the results are works of art that no one
will ever look at?
//See CCC4025. That's one of the few plausible things Sakakibara says, and it's straight out of this very sentence. I wonder if he had this chat with the guy. -GHS
Who is there to even subjugate?
Indeed.
If a person becomes Alone, the very essence of
this person alters.
It is an unavoidable compulsion.
The negative emotions that try to swell out of
themselves stop being a minus point.
It would be a society, a world, where a sin is
not a sin.
These 『eyes』 we have exist for that purpose, I
thought as if by divine revelation.
//He means more than just his Mystic Eyes. Or rather, it's the opposite. And in the end, Divine Revelation. -GHS
I turn around.
//And speaking of what his eyes are for, here's a nice possible hallucination of maybe his mother, maybe the devil. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...how long are you planning on sticking behind me?"
//come on, it's not her fault that no one can    her. -GHS

Voices carry well in this unpopulated open space.
//Is he still in front of the station...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Do you have some business with me or something?"

I wait,
yet there is no reply.
//Youko doesn't seem to exist yet. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You've gone mad."
//This is what Kiri will often tell him and her. -GHS

That I spit out, then go to walk towards the school.
I don't need someone to worry about every single thing.
The presence of a pursuit continues steady and gradual.
I'm grateful to be on the receiving end of concern,
//See CCA0014A, for starters. Now see that one in the Taichi/Youko perspective. -GHS
but still.

[Taichi]
"My hair is white, so I'm not going to get sunstroke or anything!!!"
//Research indicates... he's wrong. In fact, he's probably MORE susceptible to sunstroke. -GHS

The irritation one has for a mother, maybe, would just be like this.
//She's his second mommy, after all. -GHS
There was something refreshing and sweet to it, but it's also incredibly bothersome.
//新鮮=!!!NEO-AKIRA!!! -GHSolvedthepuzzle
Once I had arrived next to the school, I let a relieved sigh fall,
because the presence had gracefully vanished.
//But Youko can erase her presence. So why is he feeling her? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, really, that made me all nervous."

Still, it may be something that happens every time, but I get goose bumps.
It's that overbearing being.

[Taichi]
"You some kind of demon perchance?"
//COOOOUGH. -GHS

...could be nearby...
//Still trying to avoid the 'she' -GHS
It's really a big fuss to be loved by that one.
GlRlRlRlRlRlRlRlRl!
//This totally sounds like a creepy roar sped up... -GHS
It's my belly bug.
//He talks about everyone being gone, then the eyes, and then he's chased by Youko, and when she leaves the belly bug takes her place. It could be random, but the flow seen here suggests it isn't so. -GHS
It's like a wild beast.
Should I just call it my belly beast then.

[Taichi]
"There's smell of food..."

With an unsteady stagger, my feet turn towards the school cafeteria.
//But if there's no one, then this can't be possible. Is he attracted by Sakuraba's thick curry-filled bread? That sounds odd. -GHS
