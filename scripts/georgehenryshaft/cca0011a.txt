[Taichi]
"More importantly, shall we have activities?"

[Misato]
"...well."

Senpai gazes at me fixedly.

[Misato]
"Did you come to help me?"

[Taichi]
"Sir!"

[Misato]
"So you did."

Her stationary, congealed sight does not move from me.
//This being somewhat older writing it's not entirely obvious what Misato's thinking. She seems more troubled about Taichi's ulterior motives than from him coming there at all. Supposing it works since it's Week 1 and that's what readers are supposed to take away, but it doesn't make too much sense holistically (wooo big word). -GHS
Eventually, Senpai's face puffs into the broadest of smiles.
//The term also means "to come apart at the seams". Three guesses. -GHS

[Misato]
"Thank you very much, Peke-kun."

[Taichi]
"'Tis nothing, ma'am, it is the ordinary for a soldier of the Empire."
//Ah, Nations of the World. -GHS

Salute!
She laughs with a giggle.

[Misato]
"It is too bad, but the day has already turned to night."
[Misato]
"The time for fun club activity is all done."

[Taichi]
"Eeeh?"

[Misato]
"Sorry, because I decided to do this on my own, the hours are fluid."
//"the decision to do this I took on my own" + "I decided that I must do this alone". -GHS

[Taichi]
"But alone you cannot finish this, right? There is the wiring."
[Taichi]
"For starters, there is the electricity."
//Because the rooftop wouldn't have outlets, not because there's none in the world. -GHS

[Misato]
"It is alright!"
[Misato]
"Women are pluck."

[Taichi]
"Then men pluck them out."
//From "Men are charm, women are pluck", but he took off one kanji so he said "men are love". That doesn't really make sense in English, and the closest thing to this in English (men are from Mars, women are from Venus) doesn't work here. This isn't too far anyway. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Senpai, pwease, pwease---"
//Childish "boku". It's on Wikipedia and everything(tm). Gah, combo breaker -GHS

I go to sidle up and,

[Misato]
"Cluuub haaas concludeeed!"

[Taichi]
"G'buh!"

With one hand she squeezes on my face, turning me ever more ugly.
//Curiously, see CCA0030. -GHS
And blurting stuff like that "g'buh" felt like having fallen to the bottom of the Marianas Trench.
//See CCB0005. Hum, and CCB2019 too. -GHS

[Misato]
"So! Let's go home. And I remind you, that my way home and yours are in the exact opposite direction, hohohohoh!"
//She lives just a bit closer to school than Miki. They gotta share like a third of the way. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...whaaat, this cannot be fully satisfying!"
//For either of them. -GHS

[Misato]
"But still, today was really fun, was it not?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, was it now..."

[Misato]
"When you were with your face buried in my chest, you were touching my butt, right?"

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"With plenty of squeeze, and you going all 'squishity-squish!'"
//This contradicts facts; we didn't see anything of the sort. Is she making this up, knowing he wouldn't have quite remembered that time, or is the cheating here even stronger than it looks? -GHS
[Misato]
"And furthermore, with both hands."

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"And it tickled."

[Taichi]
"〜♪"
//TL Note: 〜♪ -GHS

So I whistled when faced with this derailing of thoughts.

[Misato]
"Be-ca-use-you-are-a-boooy, are you!"
//This is funnier considering "otokonoko" is sort of gaining traction as meaning "transvestite" in contemporary anime parlance (they have one). -GHS

She drills back and forth right on my temples.
It's fairly painful.
//M. -GHS
I could never swindle my way out of this.
//Meaning she sort of knows he's like this, whether she's trolling him or not. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngggh... sorryyy..."

[Misato]
"Well then, what am I to do with this."
[Misato]
"Would that mean I, myself, am a woman with about that kind of value?"
//Misato the traitor. See below: -GHS
[Misato]
"Or is it that you are merely unprincipled, Peke-kun?"
//It's not "am I worthless, or are you just a lech?", as it seems on first read; it's "am I worth something, or are you just a lech?" Consider the thing about Taichi being proud of Miki's love despite being what he is. It's ultimately religious, as humans so broken are still loved by God. And so, can Misato being what she is be loved? -GHS

[Taichi]
"NoNnoNno, I may be a Komusou, but unprincipled, really!"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komus%C5%8D -GHS
[Taichi]
"Putting me side by side with that sort worries me!!!"

When I'm desperate to deceive, my Emergency Jokes are endlessly lame.
//Translation: he's a terrible, terrible, terrible liar. -GHS

[Misato]
"Heh heh heh!"

In this evening hour, in this scene where the density of orange grows ever more, Senpai leaned her body just a little and spoke.

[Misato]
"I will forgive you for now, so it is time to go home and reflect."
//Works even better in English! Who'd have thunk it. This means both of them, however. She has plenty to reflect on, after all. -GHS
[Misato]
"This is goodbye, then, Peke-kun."

I left the school building, and looked up at the rooftop.
There the antenna stood.
And next to it,
Senpai was, once more, still there,
working, blue collar,
even when it will soon be night,
alone.
And it was at this moment that, for the first time,
I realized that help had been refused, with gentleness.
