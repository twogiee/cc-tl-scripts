               And then, Sunday.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
Tho technically these are all CCB0022. -GHS
                   Rooftop.
               All preparations
                 are in order.
             ...or so we expected.
//HACK ADV mode, music "Fear and Suspicion" -GHS
The antenna had been wrecked.
When in the world there is nothing but 『8 people』...
Mimi-senpai stood underfoot the demolished spire.
Cowering.
I tried to put a hand on her shoulder, she dodged.
//Same as CCB0022 -GHS
Tomoki and Sakuraba came,
Touko came.
//Contrast CCD0022B, where she is said to have died with no further explanation. Except for the last part where she hasn't(?). -GHS
Sakuraba punched Tomoki.
Tomoki's face, punched, distorted unnaturally.
The door opened, heavy with ill omens, and Kiri with Miki came in.
Kiri was endowed with offensive abilities.
And after that, it was no more than tumbling down.
The truth revealed.
The bonds betrayed.
//Hmmm, more Family Project-related terms... -GHS
A brittle unity more ephemeral than an illusion.
A mistake.
//See CCB0022. Three routes on, and nothing at all's changed. -GHS
A mistake, a mistake, a mistake.
What I had expected wasn't severance.
Touko dies.
Grating noises rise.
Kiri's hostility turned towards me.
That instant, I wanted to kill Kiri.
There, all done---
//HACK end music -GHS
HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
Annnnnd troll: -GHS
Running down the corridor.
The hubbub of students,
sounds of footsteps without number,
the sound of a door opening,
the chimes of the bell.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout -GHS
Silence.
In silence,
nothing should be communicable.
//Of course, plenty is. -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi has lived well and long I think."
//What the hell is he doing in the classroom now? -GHS
[Youko]
"However many dozens, however many hundreds, however many thousands of times you have kept searching for that possibility."
[Youko]
"Yet, in there, the Happy End Taichi seeks is the one thing that did not exist."
[Youko]
"All are near the Bad End, never more."
[Youko]
"Nothing but Bad Ends."
[Youko]
"...and now, do you understand?"
//HACK ...was she ever there? -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

She kept pursuing me, together with that smell of blood.
//In CCD0022, she was dead. But she's around after dying in Tower of Friends too. Well, part of my theory is that she's around after dying ever since the start anyway, so. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Why the killing?"

[Youko]
"...there is only me, for you."
//Notice: no direct answer. -GHS
[Youko]
"I wanted you to know that."
//Setting aside whether she's his Reality Censor, this may be still be replaying of the Hasekura Massacre; IOW, this is her justification for doing what she did to Taichi. -GHS
[Youko]
"It's time to put this thing to an end."
[Youko]
"And therefore, it would be best if the two of us lived our lives together."

[Taichi]
"I can't do that, you know..."

[Youko]
"Indeed."
[Youko]
"Then I will wait, however long it takes."
//HACK Flashback intro, music "Deep Inside" -GHS

The days of the mansion were immersed in darkish filth.
The figure of the self reflected on the window sort of reminds of a girl.
//See CCA0001 -GHS
Of course it does.
It's cross-dressed in women's clothing.
I had a roommate,
//Remember CCA0001 and CCC0000. The first says it's a grandiose bedroom, the second says there was no cohabitation (or talking) before he was tossed in a crappy bedroom. This bedroom isn't described, however, look close at the flow: straight from "it was a reflected figure in woman's clothing" into "I had a roommate". As with CCA0001, where he asks who the reflection is and Youko answers Taichi, there's no contradiction here as to whether this roommate is simply Youko. Don't forget CCA0030 and how Youko is never seen in person outside of a mirror until Taichi smacks his head at the start of Kiri's route. (And an internal monologue, but that obviously doesn't count.) -GHS
Hasekura Youko.
Her.
And every night her, and this still innocent boy I was, were patronized.
//I didn't manage to do much with CCD0022A, and before that new script, it had been a while since the last boku. Oddly, here it's bokutachi, while the new '22A is bokura. Slightly manlier in the latter sense. As for this, it seems to be a very nice way of saying "raped"... or is it? -GHS
At best one could call it child abuse,
but it isn't like that.
//Because this trends towards a denial. -GHS
Youko-chan and I, too, were in their custody: that is the pretext.
We were, every night, wounded by the brunt of the savage carnal desire of the people.
Every day, but every day,
there was someone who hurt, and someone who was hurt.
And then, we saw it: the final fate of one who was hurt.
//And there's the 'bokura' (now) again. Well well well... -GHS
A married couple torn apart.
//See CCC3025, I suspect. This is the first element that triggers Taichi's repeat of the CCC0000 script: death. -GHS
Even if ahead of us there was nothing but catastrophe, we could do nothing more than endure.
//HACK somewhat expanded. Term 破滅 was most interestingly used to describe the histories that Youko would be keeping hidden, so not much to this change that I can see. -GHS
We could only aspire to be left alive.
Although systematically wounded, in mind as well as body, we lived.
//HACK Not sepia, probably because the CG of Youko standing over the dead doesn't have a sepia version. Leaving unlock as sepia version. -GHS
And then, the contract.
//Oddly, CCC0000 seems to imply this was the very first time the two spoke. But the two had to have shared the room for a while then, and had been abused (if non-sexually) together. Well, perhaps it wasn't the first time they spoke? Sorta odd. -GHS
An alliance for survival that we engraved in our hearts.
Just with this vow alone we came to have strength live, plenty of it.
If only that man had not come---
//Yutaka. Or was it his father? Step 2: bullying/humiliation. -GHS
The humiliating violations grew even more extreme.
//Now this sounds like a rape nukige title in the original. -GHS
We elaborated a Project.
//There it is, now it's an again after the new CCD0022A. -GHS
Our battle capability was two children,
and the home field advantage.
The most important thing was to catch everyone at one fell swoop.
The number of our enemies is far too high to crush them one by one.
//See CCD0022A. But they did get them one by one... maybe he means "in a single event". -GHS
An equation was needed to make this impossible into possible.
//See CCD0021, "cold equation". More interesting, see CCA0006. A formula tames Taichi's penis... -GHS
We took our time, and the implements we prepared, practiced, surveyed, amended, observed, deferred, purchased, improved, investigated, determined, retracted, kissed.
//Yes, it does sound like he did all that to the implements. Leaving it ambiguous. Interesting is that they apparently buy weapons and traps off what I suppose to be the 'net AND NO ONE NOTICES. Not even the police! That's one mother of They Just Didn't Care. Also, this may be where Taichi's interest in Wacchi comes from: studying the habits of those in the mansion. -GHS
What we shall bestow them is their ruin, and the dignity they will have taken from us until then shall be the price.
Her chastity, as well, we disposed of before they could steal away.
//Still a virgin, which is not odd: it's absurd to the point that it's either intentionally telling or a plot hole the size of the moon. See CCC0000, she knew how to suck a dick, supernaturally well. That means she's done it at least, even assuming she's Super Ninja and therefore can learn everything perfectly immediately, as long as it doesn't involve Dirac having nothing to do with MWI I guess -GHSarc
We were one thing, connected, as siblings and as alter egos.
Our reciprocal give and take was not an intimate relationship.
It was merely disposal.
The Project kept stagnating, but even then we kept steadily putting it together.
//How similar to the antenna. And all it took were seven days? -GHS
And then, the day of action.
//"And then, Sunday." -GHS
14 dead.
//Yutaka was not among them so that'd be 13. Unless the total is still correct, and therefore one of the two that should've survived hasn't. This still works if Taichi killed Youko right here. -GHS
Children had become beasts.
And then we were... set free.
//Both of these are still literally true if both Taichi and Yutaka survive. And there's that 'bokura' that's so suspicious in CCD0022A. -GHS
As victims.
Yes, as an innocent boy and an innocent girl.
//Or as an innocent boy and boy-girl. -GHS
Pitiable little victims.
And the culprit...

[Taichi]
"It was a man... really big guy... no hair."
//Interesting that he'd say "no hair", given how much Taichi hates his. Despite having probably gained his silver hair not days before. And how the hell did he manage to be sane enough to hold this interview anyway? -GHS

A macabre bizarre incident that ended up imprisoned inside a deep, dark labyrinth.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout, music "Silence". Hey, wait a second... -GHS
The area in the vicinity of the shrine always stays at a constant temperature.
//And contrasting the imprisoned monsterlike thing above, the hokora, which didn't contain any imprisoned monsters at all. And how does he know it's always at a constant temperature if it's the second time (technically) that he's come here? -GHS
Why did I even come here?
When I have not come here not once since last week's Sunday, on the way back from the training camp.
//The problem is that this contradicts the entire route! The question isn't whether some strange change happened: the questions are when, and more importantly, what its exact nature is. -GHS
I wanna return.
Right, I wanna run away,
from this world of no one,
from this world that has been slaughtered.
The reason is that we,
we waded through the grass.
//They were maybe chasing him after he got off the path. waitasec SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
And we passed through here.
'Passed through' might just be a misleading way of putting it.
//No, seriously? -GHS
I just strained my eyes,
at that time...
The training camp contrived with coercion had ended in failure, and with bleak emotions all members were walking.
That was how we expended the last days of this Summer break far longer than that of typical educational institutes.
//Another beautiful thing to have for the Great Gunjou Institute: long long weeks in which it's closed. -GHS
Everybody must've felt embittered.
I, myself, did.
I walked ahead as if to run away.
I wanted to run away.
And those eyes I had seized something.
//I can't stop thinking of CCC3005, of course. -GHS
I felt, instinctively, a void on that other side.
//It's all about his sight and his eyes, i.e. very possibly all in his mind. And what was he doing at the hokora, which is well off the beaten path? -GHS
And at that time I thought, transiently, that I'd rather become alone.
//Except he didn't, see CCX0001. He's not so much misremembering as simply lying to himself. -GHS
I strained my eyes.
And when I did the world, like a trompe l'oeil, was replaced.
//Scream, scream, scream the obvious. See CCZAS, which is similar but subtly different. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

I am someone capable of observing two worlds.
//See CCD0021. But what came first: his doing it, or her explanation? -GHS
And then I knew that the world was far more preposterous than I thought.
//HACK Zoom hokora instead of reinserting the BG. This seems to have been planned... -GHS
Irritation going through me, I kicked the hokora.
//Now or back then? :-) -GHS
The impact opens the doors.
Opening this here, even for my prankster self, was the very inaugural first time.
//I can't seem to work 'birth' in it without sounding silly, that veeery fine detail might have to go. It's far more important, however, to notice that this continues not to match what has happened in this route in the slightest. This isn't comparable to what happened Week 2, where only the penultimate script was wonky; Youko was chatting about the hokora not a script and a half ago. -GHS
I peeked inside,
//HACK out music -GHS
and am startled.

[Taichi]
"The hell is... this..."

What was packed tightly in there was,
bundle after bundle of notebooks, crammed and packed tight up to the ceiling.
//See CCD0005A for exact contrast, but now add in CCD0021. The notebooks, then, would just... appear. Pretty much simultaneously with Taichi's apparent disappearing of memories of the hokora. Other oddity: the only other time the term 'bundle' (or bunch) is used with notebooks is in CCC0003B, when Taichi's handed over a new set of them. He is later said to have torn the package open; possibly coincidence, but man, if most of these were just brand-new shrinkwrapped notebooks, what a laugh... -GHS

[Taichi]
"What's this...?"

College notebooks, crammed inside until there seemed to be no gap between.
//Hard to tell given there's no real way to calculate proportions, but given Taichi barely fits I'd guesstimate at least 2000 B5 notebooks. Oddly close to that 1771 figure we'll see in CCX0001, isn't it. -GHS
Feeling something chilling, I try to pull out one of them.
I shuddered, horrified.
Ain't this my handwriting?
//Second time he recognized it. -GHS
And that one, and this one too!

[Taichi]
"And this one... ah, and this one too...?"

Yet I lack the memories of writing them.
I follow the handwriting.
First volume... second volume...
//They're tagged, see CCC0007 -GHS
Confusion grew alongside my continued reading.
Seventh volume... eighth volume...
//Oh random numbers. -GHS
Having crossed a certain point, one doubt intracerebrally achieved instantaneous organic combination:
//Seems to be a really pretentious (AKA trollish) way of saying "a question formed in my mind". -GHS

[Taichi]
"...are we... repeating?"
//Wait a second here. There's NO notebooks where "this is a time loop" is written explicitly? -GHS

And then, while I would be having a love relationship, or a return to good terms, or a reconciliation with someone... I sought, with constant probability, the blissful result that is the unity of all of us.
The world ends in a week,
there is that period of time and no more.
And understanding that we're repeating, that we're being reset, and still---
Friendship, bonds, solidarity...
//See CCD0021 -GHS
The word doesn't matter,
『That』 is what I sought.
The outcome is... a ruthlessly cruel thing.
The happy ending should not be expected to exist.

[Nanaka]
"...Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka...?"

The girl I met at the beginning of the week.
//Who led him to the hokora... NOT! Is this the end of the first week now? Was this always how it ended? -GHS
However, the notebooks indicated her existence.

[Nanaka]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...what's this, all this..."
[Taichi]
"What kind of situation is even this?"
[Taichi]
"...everybody's... dead..."
[Taichi]
"But soon, everything will become nothing, and then we're redoing this from the start, right?"
[Taichi]
"The hell's with that!"
[Taichi]
"An uncountable number of attempts, and..."

Just by the number of bundles of notebooks... no, if we include the possibilities not recorded, it may be many times this.

[Taichi]
"Is this it?"

The darkened blood of that uproar still clung to the palm of the hand I thrust at her.

[Taichi]
"Just this fucking punchline!"
//No triple exclamation marks for tone. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It's just, ya know... a result that feels a bit pleasant... isn't there one?"
//See CCD0021. The Ghost of Selfishness Past said no. Let's see the Sorta-Holy Spirit... -GHS
[Taichi]
"How many times have I repeated this?"
[Taichi]
"How many times will I have to repeat this?"
[Taichi]
"How long do I have to keep making mistakes before you're satisfied!"
//An impersonal 'you'. But since he's accusing her of being the cause of this, it should work either way. -GHS
[Taichi]
"How many times do I have to cross through destruction like this one... to finally reach my destination."
[Taichi]
"...how many times will I... everyone..."

I punch the trunk of a tree.
//Does it leave a dent? That'd be familiar, as if it was an old dream... -GHS

[Taichi]
"When everybody is so necessary to me!"
[Taichi]
"...was there even just one time when I got a happy ending?"
//Week 1, maybe. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Answer me! You know don't you? You're someone with way lots of power, aren't you?"
[Taichi]
"Because you're the boss of this world, aren't you?!"

I scowl at her.
//HACK earlier doll -GHS
The girl, sadness on her face, shifted her gaze from me.

[Nanaka]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"ANSWER ME!"

[Nanaka]
"Say, isn't it OK if there isn't really much of a Happy End?"
[Nanaka]
"Go be together with someone separately from the rest, and be happy."
//This is different from Youko's, although it sounds similar: she's not saying he should remove everyone but a possible split personality from the world, but to live with some and accept not being able to live with everyone. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Or just go play with your friends."
//This, however, shows why this alternative remains dangerous... -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Isn't it fine if you play here, always, for all time?"
[Nanaka]
"I think you could just live without stress, Taichi, in this world of constant fresh starts."
//Sooort of vaguely Youko-ish tho. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Ain't it carefree?"
[Nanaka]
"Or is that... no good?"
[Nanaka]
"There's me too, I'm here."
//So Taichi could also play with his mother... hints that not only Youko, but everyone else is fake are strong within this part. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"No good?"

[Taichi]
"...but the other side of that happiness is that there's possibility I will lay hands on everyone, right?"
//Which brings the question of why he would care. All is reset. There's nothing that remains except worthless notebooks. This is what he can't accept, and why he can't possibly be as broken as he claims to be. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Could be that I won't do it, but that she'd do it herself."
//In his name, see CCC3012A. Or would "she". -GHS
[Taichi]
"A weekend of happiness and a weekend of unhappiness are identically probable."
[Taichi]
"There's unhappiness along with happiness, like two sides of the same coin."
//Continuing the duality theme that has endured throughout the story, all the way from splitting the world in two, separated by an impassable peak. Except of course Taichi will Take A Third Option. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Acquiring as much happiness as you like is great, sure. But sin..."

I push down a bunch of notebooks.
They collapse via domino effect, covering up part of the ground.

[Taichi]
"Sins will be recorded forever and more, won't they?"
//And this is one of the biggest points of the story. There isn't much in the way of philosophies that expressly claim that sin is eternal and can never be taken back, whether you are aware of having done something sinful or not, and still manage to have a way out of things that doesn't end in handwaving. -GHS
[Taichi]
"How can I be able to have a life without stress... with that..."
//It's not rejecting her idea, of course, because this isn't her idea... it never was. Her proposal was a test. -GHS
[Taichi]
"What's to be carefree about."
[Taichi]
"...this here is... hell."
//HACK closed eyes Nanaka instead of reinserting the same doll. Say, compare CCD0021 again: note how her major expressions are eyes open and eyes closed, exactly like Youko? -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...Taichi."

[Taichi]
"What can be fun when I hurt my own close friends!"
[Taichi]
"Why is it that I always blow up right when I must put up with things instead!"
//Except that his has been relatively rare so far. Just in a few precise locations: with Yutaka, especially. -GHS
[Taichi]
"What part of me is sacred at all!"
//Cough, cough cough coooOoOugh. -GHS
[Taichi]
"If the world really gets reset, then why are all the sin I've committed until now recorded in here!"
[Taichi]
"What Yutaka did to me will never, ever become fiction."
//Careful now: the loop didn't exist before Yutaka, even ignoring that it never did. And he just finished talking about HIS sins. Those are not the only one that will keep existing forever. This is a very telling line. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Sins will just keep on existing in there forever, won't they?"
//So even Yutaka's sin towards him will be in the hokora. Again, telling. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And as long as people exist, the pile of my sins will grow."
//That doesn't exclude that HIS death must also be. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And that's why, when I returned from the training camp, I just wanted to go elsewhere."
[Taichi]
"I wanted to go to a place where there could be me, alone, and no one else."
[Taichi]
"...why did everyone else get involved?"
//He's not going anywhere without Youko, for starters... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"That's, well, Taichi..."

Compassion on her face.

[Nanaka]
"That's, well... because you looked at everyone, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...what'd you say?"

[Nanaka]
"The moment you were brought in here, you looked at everyone, didn'cha Taichi."
//b w spamming  he le  er   is fun:              . -GHS
[Nanaka]
"...you were terrified of becoming alone, and you looked behind you didn't you?"
//The problem being this: how did he forget this liiittle detail here? See CCC0002: he didn't. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"By observing everyone, Taichi, you pulled them in."
//Everyone is in this world because Taichi is looking at them. That's as rubbed in people's faces as it can get. And that's not even the troll: the troll is that Nanaka is also here, therefore she was pulled in as well. This explains the troll in Another Story: he sees eight presences because that includes the seven of the club outside of him plus Nanaka. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I've...?"
//...sound??? -GHS

[Nanaka]
"You've even said it yourself!"
[Nanaka]
"You said others are necessary."

[Taichi]
"Just so I could hurt them?"

[Nanaka]
"Nuh-uh."
[Nanaka]
"For the sake of yourself being yourself---"

[Taichi]
"I hate myself, what I am..."

[Nanaka]
"Dont'cha say that, stupid!"

I am struck.
There was no felt impact at all, but the heart swayed. Just a little.

[Nanaka]
"Stupid, stupid..."

And again and again so many times she strikes at my chest.

[Taichi]
"...sorry."

With two fists still over my breast, Nanaka says,

[Nanaka]
"Ya certainly've been raising something scary inside your heart."
//Don't lose the plot now: she's referring to his self-hatred! This is possibly why his test score is that high: he believes it with all his might that it should be so. He is becoming the facade of a monster pretending to be human. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Humans aren't noble."
[Nanaka]
"And the world's not beautiful."
[Nanaka]
"But ya know, Taichi, don't you have this just one thing that's so beautiful?"

[Taichi]
"...I don't got nothing that is. Just got wickedness. A heart specialized in hurting others just can't have anything beautiful."
//craaaaaaaaawling iiiin my skiiiiiiin -GHS

[Nanaka]
"But even like that, you still have this longing for normality, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"..."

[Nanaka]
"Dreaming of healthy wholesomeness, and imitating that... you want to live without even hurting anyone, without even a thought of doing that, that's what I think."
//This is where the contrast with Youko is most obvious. Youko doesn't believe there's any saving Taichi. Silly little girl. Touko 'gets' him better than she does. That's because there's one more layer that may escape by thinking him "just" someone working to pretend to be a monster pretending to be a human: he still hasn't become the pretension of pretending; he's still that initial someone. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's only what you think."

[Nanaka]
"But that's an enormous wealth!"
[Nanaka]
"Be proud of that, just a little."

[Taichi]
"...I'm... I'm..."

[Nanak]
"Isn't it fine if you just continue living forever in this one week?"

Her words are gentle, and resounded in the heart.
No, it was just like,
just like the voice itself was coming from inside my heart.
Nostalgic, somehow.

[Taichi]
"...no."

I shake my head to the neck.

[Taichi]
"...repatriation. I'll send them back."
//In the sense of broadcast, in the sense of returning them to the world in which they belong, and the metaphorical sending to Heaven, the true home of man. Notice that Taichi is not unsure that the real world is preserved perfectly, despite CCD0021. -GHS

[Nanak]
"Back... you say...?"

[Taichi]
"I'll return them to the world of origin, all of them... I will."

[Nanaka]
"Taichi... that's..."

[Taichi]
"Possible, I think. I remembered."
[Taichi]
"Because I can maybe say... that place..."
[Taichi]
"That place will be extremely simple to observe, I think."
[Taichi]
"There's this image that's left there, sort of like light coming from a crack."
//SYMBOLISM. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I don't think it can be seen by any but me, though."
//Notice he describes something he hasn't actually seen. -GHS
[Taichi]
"In that place there it might just be possible to get everyone home,"
[Taichi]
"via the act of my observation."

[Nanaka]
"Hold up, just hold up!"
[Nanaka]
"...you'll become alone won't you?!"

Sorrow,
while on the other side, I remain horrendously calm.

[Taichi]
"That would be... good."

Nanaka appeared to be at a loss for words.
I take up one notebook,
the recounting of the days of a myself that I don't know.
//HACK two new lines. Because... -GHS

[Taichi]
"The name of the Broadcast Station is Cross Channel after all."
//...he couldn't possibly know it otherwise, and since it's only ever seen shown on a Sunday, there'd be no way for the reader to know. This indeed confused me. In fact, since he just said he picked up a notebook, and it's very possible he didn't actually read this in there, it still doesn't change much. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because I am Kurosu."
[Taichi]
"It's just a stupid translingual pun, I know."
//Well, it's true. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Intercommunication is the skill, the art, the technology people use when they desire connection, isn't it?"
//See CCA0017A. Expanded because I'm tired of saying it, either you get it already or you're too dumb to. Indeed, even the dumb NEETs with their waifus want more than solitude. We read to know we are not alone. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Telephone, CB, radio, television, mail, cellphone, conversation, letters..."
//See CCA0017A again. Going with CB as it's easier to understand here. So if these aren't "usable" anymore, then it's not necessarily because nothing's coming through them: it's because they've lost the skill to make use of them, IOW the ability to communicate with the world. -GHS
[Taichi]
"They cannot become one with who's on the other side. But for that one hour, one moment, one occasion they can feel they are crossing."
[Taichi]
"That's what being a human is."
[Taichi]
"The act of crossing the channels. And in that..."
[Taichi]
"There's also an intersection of hearts."
[Taichi]
"In sooo many ways and meanings. And because of that I, finally, understood:"
[Taichi]
"I am incapable of crossing with anyone---"
//See ending, of course. He's STILL lying to himself after all this: his crossing just takes a different form. He doesn't know or care, and in many a sense, there's no need for the reader to know or care either. Like with the autistic girl lost in her sea of numbers, what's it to anyone else that he mostly ignores the world outside of talking from his antenna, provided he's happy? -GHS

[Nanaka]
"..."

When she embraces me, she gives me this sense of security as if I was taking a nap enveloped by the warmth of the sun.
//See the very last CG of the story, as well. He's still remembering being embraced by her when he was a baby. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nanaka...?"

[Nanaka]
"Sorry... I could leave you with nothing more than that..."

Leave me with?
What is she even saying now?

[Taichi]
"Leave me with what?"

However, she was here no more.

[Taichi]
"Eh... Nanaka?"
[Taichi]
"NANAKAAAA!"

No sign of her presence at all.
She seems to be perfectly and completely no more.
//Just like Youko! -GHS
A bitter smile.

[Taichi]
"...this is something I gotta do alone, then."

I returned the notebooks to the hokora.

[Taichi]
"There is no space for me to get in then..."
//Because his surface area increased too much, see CCC0007. SYMBOLISM...? -GHS

Right.
The notebooks of the past exist:
they show that this hokora is disconnected from the rules of time.
It's very likely no coincidence that the gate is located near the hokora.
//Boy is it ever not. -GHS
Therefore,
I sit down behind the hokora.
//Where Youko was when she was killed, likely. Interestingly, it's only ever hinted that the INSIDE of the hokora is exempt from the loop; in fact, CCC4025 hints Miki just sits inside the hokora during the loop itself (she's smaller, she'd fit with the notebooks). The chuuni is evolving. -GHS
And---

[Taichi]
"?!"

What's with it being sunset all of a sudden?

[Taichi]
"The... hell is this?"

I raise my eyes to the sky.
The brilliant red scarlet is increasing in concentration.
A brutally deep crimson assimilates the world into the color of blood.
//HACK pixelate and back -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ngh..."

I had vertigo.
//HACK pixelate and back -GHS
A... horrible... vertigo...
I close my eyes.
My semicircular canals sway as if I had just gotten off the teacups ride at an amusement part.

[Taichi]
"Aaah......"

And then, the sunset of the world came.
............
......
...
When I was awake, the cold air peculiar to morning prickled my skin.

[Taichi]
"Then this..."

I ascended the mountain trail,
to a spot where I can look over.
//Probably same as CCA0002, i.e. the very very start, as well as the double date, see CCC4009. -GHS

[Taichi]
"No sign of people..."

I must confirm what day of the week it is.
I descended the mountain.
............

[Taichi]
"Haaah, haaah..."

I fly into the Tasaki Store.
//Odd. The school is much closer to the hokora. -GHS
I should be able to clarify the date there.
//See CCA0001. "That even the date was vague... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...September... seven."

Of all the memos posted up, that one was the newest.
No, this still isn't proof.
I rush into the classroom,
and simultaneously lost all words.
In a seat in the row next to the window,
here sat a girl, with her elbow on the table, sends a single peeking glance my way.

[Touko]
"..."
//HACK forgot the voice file there -GHS

Without a word, she returns her line of sight to the outside.
There were no words directed my way.
//Supposing it's her, given he's about to talk to her... -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're alive..."

I cover my eyes.
This girl... in my memories, she had died yesterday.
//Still nothing that denies that it's his memories that are wrong. It's sure as hell proven he has trouble remembering stuff consciously, just look at his failure to remember his own damn mother despite her hanging around him. -GHS

[Taichi]
Aaah..."

Falling to my knees, passively surrendering my body whole to the numbness that came from out of my feelings.
Touko cast a sight at me that said she was looking at something odd.
//The Tasaki Store thing was odd, but here Tanaka flat-out forgets continuity. He's soaked in blood from head to toe, she should be screaming bloody murder right now! Unless, of course, he isn't at all, nothing strange happened the day before, and it's all as it should be. -GHS

[Taichi]
"See ya, 'K."

Waving my hand with an oddly stiffened smile, I leave the classroom.
//...and then he comes back? Or he goes into another classroom? This is so odd, but never changed in any version. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...it's Monday."

I have returned.
//No he hasn't... not to the real world. But that's not where he wants to go, after all. -GHS
I have returned with I staying as I.
I climb the mountain once again.
I peek at the that peculiar spot, but that peculiar sense of connection had vanished.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm... not here?"

That's nonsense.
Flustered, I search the surroundings.

[Taichi]
"...right then."

An understanding matures.

[Taichi]
"Outside of a specific time, the connection's impossible."

Whatever the reason, I cannot but think so.
//...and he got to it without any thought himself. Remember this for CCX0001. Whoops. -GHS
At any rate, I will be able to discern in the weekend.
And if I don't understand, I'll just do one more week of further investigation.
I took the notebooks out of the hokora.
I will investigate them,
all the events that can occur in this world.
I will learn.
If that perfect flawless happiness is to be nowhere, then that will still be just fine.
Getting along with everybody was never more than my own personal wish.
Among the contacts with each individual person there are methods to attain only the very best results.
That will become my keep.
//See CCC3007. -GHS
A life with memories in my heart.
One sentence can explain it:
I desire,
an Eden to live in where I don't hurt anyone.
//I'm sorry, but with a period in there that's two sentences. Is Tanaka still trolling us? Not that it matters. I can't wait to have to ridicules some illiterate imbecile who attempts to claim I put random commas in the text because I ended sentences that are not supposed to be read side-by-side with them. -GHS
Mutsumi-san... I think I will be able to acquire that.
//And why would he bring her up now...? Unless she's like right around there and wondering what the hell he's doing, and he's telling her he wants to "sleep at the hokora" (AKA go to Church every Sunday). -GHS
And then,
and then,
and then---
