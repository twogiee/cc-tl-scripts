They say that if the cellphone shows three antenna bars, the reception of EM waves will be perfect.
//There ARE some distant dolls used sporadically in the main scenario, however. -GHS
//This isn't necessarily true in the West, especially in recent times (5 bars has the iPhone). And, admittedly, this does sound like it's talking about erecting antennas, given the rest of the story after all. Truth, of course, is that he's talking about the Three Penises that are Necessary to Fulfill Women(tm). -GHSecsiss
One bar and it's a little weak.
Two bars and it's still sorta weak. The gauge of the antenna reminds me of power.
//Although I can't find that word used to indicate that display, that's what he's obviously talking about. -GHS
Three bars, and it's full power. Feels like it's saying, "I'm conveying!".
I don't recollect when it was that I was vaguely thinking on that, however...
At the time when I had insufficient willpower to speculate in peace, tedium, quiet and automatism, I amplified these passing impressions I had and aroused new intracerebral images.
//He refers to his time in the Mansion. This is the crap he was thinking as a little boy with too much time on his hands, too many books, and too little reason to have any level of adherence to reality. -GHS
Meaning, if I go beyond three bars, I'll go beyond space-time itself!
//Translation: "could I break through this incomprehensible phenomenon by increasing the emission strength?" This is exactly as nonsensical as attempting to reach Heaven (which is a place philosophically above mankind, not physically in the sky) by building a tower. This scenario is about the building of the Tower of Babel. The madness of mankind having barely survived the Flood is here represented by moege tropes and RPG delirium. This is for two reasons: 1) Cross Channel 2) Japan. -GHS
I was thinking of wasting time with these middle schooler-level fantasies until the day I died.
//Indeed, it's all chuunibyou here. -GHS
But in truth, I didn't even reach the point of waste.

Next to me was a girl. This is Mimimi. Written in kanji it's beauty, kanji repetition, beauty. She's my Imouto-in-law.
//Tech term as this part is Taichi having VN delusions.

She comes every day to wake me up.

[Mimimi]
"Really, Onii-chan, wake up alreadyyy!"

I get it...

[Mimimi]
"When Mimimi isn't here, you really go all bad, Onii-chan!"
//Another VN/eroge cliche' that's never quite translated in a standard way, so the reference will have to stay like this until I translate every moege ever and finally have a standardized translation, as well as the undisputed dominion over the Universe that awaits anyone who does so. Seeing CCD1001 and CCD0002, however, this is also literally true. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hah hah!"
//That's the Kiri bathroom scene. Nice. -GHS

I made a bitter smile.
Lately she's been acting somewhat precocious, but some time ago she(snip)---
//Boring descriptions are boring, though the "time ago" usually means the Mansion. Remember Youko is technically also his older sister, besides childhood friend denpa super ninja with a sword she totally didn't steal from Touko. -GHS

"Imma leave you behiiind!"
//Taichi will be waaay flat-out ruder here than he is normally. This is Nukige Protagonist Turned Moege Protagonist Taichi. -GHS

[Mimimi]
"Awww, wait uuup!"

My Imouto-in-law riding on the back, we head to school.

"It has?"

It might just have been, perhaps.

[Taichi]
"Really... so much elasticity, it's..."

[Mimimi]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"Breasts... well..."
//?????????? -GHS

They're quite big. They press on me insistently. Were they always this big?
//See CCA0015B, CCA0026 -GHS
When did they even grow like this?

[Mimimi]
"Perv!"

Thunk!

[Taichi]
"Awch!"
[Taichi]
"All jokes aside, I don't really mind giving you a ride every day, you know?"

[Mimimi]
"But there's morning practice!"
//See CCA0005A, Taichi does have it. Whose it is left ambiguous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And all that."
//"Indeed" + "(snip)", further hints that this is thrown together in his mind to avoid the boring parts. -GHS

[Mimimi]
"And Onii-chan is always with that person..."

[Taichi]
"That person... Touko?"

[Mimimi]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Come on now, I told you me and Touko are like whatever. Stop with these weird suspicions already."

[Mimimi]
"But are you now..."

[Taichi]
"We are. The point is, I said, that hysteric isn't the kind of girl I like."

[Mimimi]
"Onii-chan, you're pretty popular aren't you?"
//See CCD2002 - heh. -GHS

†††
//†x3 -GHS

[Taichi]
"You serious?!"

That story, it's something I never heard before.
//Very very intentional. -GHS

[Mimimi]
"In our class you even have a fan club."
//No, that's what popular GIRLS have. Like with the Taichi Bag and the Taichi Doll, Taichi is confusing himself for the popular GIRL character. Which is pretty much the point. -GHS

"B-, but I've never had anyone confess to me, not once!"

[Mimimi]
"I'm telling you, they're restraining themselves!"
//Misato's just looking for plausible deniability, Touko for Taichi to come talk to her, Kiri for him to settle things with Yutaka, Miki is just being unserious... even Yusa possibly wanted him. It's all literally true. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Lots of gyarls are keeping in restraint... about me?!"
//OnNYANoko-desu-nya, obviously a reference to Lucky Star (nyope). -GHS

[Mimimi]
"'Gyarls' he said... this guy..."

[Taichi]
"Yu-up. I just can't believe that."

[Mimimi]
"...I don't want to believe it either!"

[Taichi]
"Eh? Whatd'ja say? I can't hear you!"

I was punched.
Even Wakabayashi couldn't catch her point.

[Mimimi]
"......"

And after that, my Imouto-in-law sank into silence.
Still not understanding her point, I put my strength on the pedals.

//†x1 -GHS
The geometric alignment of the desks inside this ever unchanging classroom steals the body temperature of the people left inside its atmosphere.
//Grinding repetition and perfect unchanging identity kill the soul. Also Touko's gonna die. -GHS
I draw near Touko's desk, then get close and talk to Touko's red desk.
//Once more "get close and talk". This was weird in the original but this reads even weirder while not being that off-tone, so I agree with the change. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yoh."

[Touko]
"Seriously you, you should start acting after you've given things some thought!"

[Taichi]
"What are you talking about now? I don't getcha!"

[Touko]
"If you keep staying all glued to that little sister of yours, you'll look like a siscon."
//If Tomoki were the protagonist, Misato'd totally be his non-blood-related imouto. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huuuh? The hell's that?"
[Taichi]
"Of course, Mimimi's just my sister-in-law, but we're siblings you know?"
[Taichi]
"Just helping someone you have a blood relation with getting on the bike isn't... wait, how do you even know that?!"
//He does literally say "placing her on the bike". "Blood relation" is contradictory; the kanji are "flesh" and "parents/kindness", maybe just "been nice to her body" (AKA kill/have sex)? Just reaching, sadly. -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"So you saw us come to school in bicycle somehow?"
[Taichi]
"But you come to school earlier than me..."
//Still true. -GHS

[Touko]
"Shut up, I just heard of it!"

[Taichi]
"From who!"

[Touko]
"A friend!"

[Taichi]
"A friend, now, didn't you say they didn't exist to you and stuff? You keeping company with the common folks now?"
//Going with a nice literal "inai"; it's literally true, whether literally nonexistant or her simply ignoring them. It's all false here, yet it's all true. -GHS

[Touko]
"U-, ukyu..."

†††††††††††††††††††††
//†x21 7x3 - all the ones before this are 14 7x2 -GHS

[Taichi]
"What's 'ukyu' now. You're blurting out stuff like the heroine of a videogame now."
//Original had him questioning if she's gone insane. Too blunt, again. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...you, you couldn't be burning in jealousy now?"
//Literally true. Also see Youko. -GHS

[Touko]
"MokYYYYYYYYYY!!!"
//This has 3 exclamation marks, CCC3004 has two. This is so in every version. -GHSoOCD

And she fired into a rage. It's like always.
I took shelter in the corridor until the beginning of classes.
//Notice how the progress is nearly identical to how it normally is: leave home (here what looks like the Training Camp, complete with Imouto/Prez), school, annoy Touko, corridor, Tomoki (and Sakuraba), corridor again (though Kiri instead of Miki), rooftop. -GHS
Lunch break.
Tomoki and Sakuraba. They were eating in the cafeteria.
//Yes, hmmm, it needs to be subtly OFF to better BE this SCAMOTIGRIPHICATIONING of NORMALCY hum, yes, yes, yes, hum! -GHSoArtistic
I add myself to their Nakama.

[Taichi]
"Yoh."

[Tomoki]
Friendship demands..."

[Sakuraba]
"Nothing in return."
//Mercifully, these are the only lines of Sakuraba's in Another Story, and they already exist in the VN, so there's no need to insert the ones from the terrible terrible new VA. They're only slightly different in their delivery (and it's terrible in both cases). It's almost a small mercy I can't access the data and can't port After Story. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Did you all watch TV last night?"
//Yes, similar line to the one he uses with Touko there. -GHS

[Tomoki]
Friendship demands..."
//Writing male dialog sucks, so there it is, all of it. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Nothing in return."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, that's right, that's so right."
[Taichi]
"And then I went around the news sites-"
//Odd. That's not two dashes; that's a vowel elongation and then a dash. See CCE0001? Maybe a typo, but it's like this in the 360 version too. -GHS

[Tomoki]
Friendship demands..."

[Sakuraba]
"Nothing in return."

[Taichi]
"And, this is the Major Debut at last!"
//See CCC0031B -GHS

[Tomoki]
Friendship demands..."

[Sakuraba]
"Nothing in return."

We had a fun conversation.
These guys are partners in crime, no mistake there, but both are good guys.
These are difficult friends to obtain, who don't participate to the story, but carry on their back the role of Male Friend Representatives without ever making one nasty face.
//This only applies to average VNs, of course, not here where Sakuraba is more important than anyone except probably Taichi, and even then it's only probably. -GHS
I found Kiri in the corridor.
//This was the same as CCC0011C, not anymore. -GHS
She's an underclassman who really idolizes me.

[Taichi]
"Kiriii!"
//Not Kiri-chin... -GHS

Called out to, Kiri rushed over with a smile.
//The 360 version has below-the-knee dolls, like the earlier Deus Ex Chaos P-Mate trial, which work better to give a three-stage distance to character in 16:9 screen size, although they look sorta like crap in 4:3.

[Kiri]
"Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Lunch?"

[Kiri]
"Ate it."

[Taichi]
"You have a bento haven't you, Kiri. Sooo nice..."
//See CCC0031B and CCD3003B, she can cook it seems. -GHS

[Kiri]
"You ate in the cafeteria, Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"That's right, in the cafeteria. And yeah, I just about got sick of it."

[Kiri]
"Therefore... how about I make some lunch for you?"

//†x19 (9-1=8?) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Naaah, no need to go that far."

[Kiri]
"Are you sure?"

[Taichi]
"But once in while'd be nice... I wanna try eating your handmade food, Kiri!"
//Him eating with her can only happen in the Miki route, or if having looped the Kiri route at least once. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ahah!♪"

She's so delighted that she'll make even me become happy.
//Still subtly off. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Then, next time I will be making some."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I'll be looking forwards to it!"
[Taichi]
"And in thanks... right, yes... I'll give you this doll that I won at the arcade."
//FACT: UFO Catchers are responsible for the disappearance of most of the cows in Japan, forcing them on their rice-and-imouto-tentacle-rape economy. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Wah, thank you very much!"
//And that's why she has it, not because of CCC3004. Even though she dies here, but it's no big deal; if Taichi is a witch, then she has a simple out of being killed by him. -GHS
[Kiri]
"What is this doll from?"

[Taichi]
"Dunno... it's some doll. Something from an anime maybe?"
//Taichi Goods. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I do not know."
//PCP CCC3029 (though it doesn't make sense in this context...) -GHS
[Kiri]
"But it resembles you a bit, Senpai... look!"

[Taichi]
"It looks like me? It does? But for starters, my hair isn't white at all!"
//This is the ultimate in hair trolls. If he doesn't have white hair in Gunjou, then either he didn't have it from the start, meaning he's unlikely to have been picked as a Living Doll, or he didn't lose the pigment in the Massacre, meaning it didn't happen. And then he would have no reason to be broken the way he is, although there's always the Original Sin and all that. In short, he's replaying the updated CCA0022A. This is not a different Taichi in the obvious sense. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Yes, that is true, but still."
//uhmmm what's a hair troll -GHS

Kiri held the doll tight, and smiled brightly.

[Kiri]
"Thank you, Senpai, I will treasure this!"

//†x9 this and the last make 28 7x4 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nah, it's not like it's so important... you act that please, I'll get embarrassed!"

[Kiri]
"Purr, purr."
//The tsunderes have been mate-ing again... -GHS

And Kiri goes to rub her cheek on the doll's.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah..."

I felt spent.
//Hmmm, see CCE0001. -GHS
†
//360 exclusive again! -GHS
After school, I came to the rooftop.
Youko-nee is there. She's a... big sister-like person to me.
//This scene, even in the "real" version, implies Youko is not a misanthrope. But more oddly, Taichi seems to see HER as a Big Sis, instead of Misato in the real (?) story. As said above, it's technically true. -GHS
††††††††††††††††††††††
//†x22 -GHS
She lives near me. Brilliant academic results, preeminent motor skills.
//First part's like Yusa, more Misato->Youko substitution. In fact, since she lives far enough from Taichi that Sakuraba would also be his neighbor, she might live in Yusa's house in the first place in this delusion. See CCA0007 for brilliant academic results, motor skills are Nanaka's stuff. That 'preeminent' is read with the same 'flock' kanji as Gunjou and more. -GHS
She has been treating me with teasing affection since long ago, and of late that's become a little embarrassing.
//This modification makes this be literally true, since that "long ago" once more means the Mansion massacre. -GHS
She's the Broadcast Club President. Considering her skills, that's natural.
//See CCC0045A: in the course of fixing the apparent characterizational discrepancy, Taichi points out the troll. Curiously, despite it all, she's only ever seen taking over for Misato in CCD1001, and even then that's very suspect. -GHS
She had promptly taken over the President's role from when she was in Second Year.
//Although it's not certain she was president back when Gunjou was first recruited, back in the earliest flashbacks in CCC1001/B, Misato has otherwise alway been the president. -GHS
Our carefree Third Years went to retire shortly afterwards.
//Curiously, a take much more in line with normal Youko existed in the final files, labeled 0142. Unsure if it's used anywhere, it's not used here. -GHS

[Youko]
"It's Taichi!"

On spotting me, the girl rushed over like a little puppy.
//teh gurlz all fall to his feet and he's the sex god to them all. Same as Kiri above, the actual movement is missing due to missing doll. -GHS

[Youko]
"Did you come for Club?"

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, I sorta wanna see how's things."
//Still pretty much the same he always does. -GHS

[Youko]
"I see."

A complicated expression.
//Well, Yusa IS as Misato in many ways, ergo Miki for Youko(?). -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi, but you're a club member... you just have to come by every day!"

Taichi"Uh!......even if you make such a cryful face"
//Still way intentional. -GHS
This girl with brilliant academic results and preeminent motor skills is unexpectedly a crybaby.
//See CCA0010. Literally true, see CCD5001. -GHS

[Youko]
"After all... I did tell you to come help us..."

[Taichi]
"Help, now... you did say that, but... that time, well..."
[Taichi]
"Miki was still alive..."
//Miki seems to have become as Yutaka here. Given Taichi will crucify her near the end, that seems the whole point. I wonder if this alternate route was caused by Taichi snapping when he's led to realize, perhaps subconsciously, that Miki was manipulating him and the others. And this despite all being part of his 98 Game, meaning he'd be taking things waaaay too seriously. This is what Rampancy is to him, perhaps. -GHS

The expression on Youko-nee's face freezes.
//No need to do transparencies? YAY! NOTE TO SELF: GS goes AFTER GL [is looking at a leftover doll of Tomoki with the caption "Yamanobe Miki"] -GHS
Yamanobe Miki.
She was my girlfriend.
//WHOA! 'Her' can mean girlfriend, but it was impossible, in the original, to tell this was the meaning. Indeed, Miki's different from the rest as it's the closest to being Taichi's potential wife, or at least, permanent playing partner. There's the problem of whether it wouldn't just end up like Taichi and Youko, though. -GHS
She was a very capable girl. She always made me a lunch box, hand made. And yet...
//Miki can only sort-of cook even after an unknown length of Unreset, see CCC0017. I have no idea why whoever did the script added that Miki voice line, it isn't in the text. This contradicts the Kiri scene above, but it's very likely intentional. -GHS
...she died in an accident.
//Perhaps in the Rooftop accident, instead of Kiri, triggering this mess? See CCC4006. If so, the conflation with Yutaka (also fallen from the rooftop) would make sense: he'd totally want to torture Yutaka, still, ergo the crucifixion later. -GHS
My memories of that time still pierce at my heart from time to time.
//Well, he'll repay the debt later. -GHS

[Youko]
"Uhm... well... I'm sorry..."

I ended up making her cry.
Feelings of guilt.

[Taichi]
"Ah, this doesn't really mean I hate you or anything, Youko-chan, OK?"
//Odd he calls her Youko-chan even here. -GHS

[Youko]
"Really?"
//Stop making such smiles, you suching such of a suching such, or I'll such you a such and call you a such - and then such you. -GHS

I make sure that there's no one looking over around us.
//See CCA0015B... when it was Youko, as confirmed in CCD1001. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Of course. I love you!"

Bam, Youko-nee's face went glittering.
//Hasekura Youko version/nearly expressionless -GHS

[Youko]
"Then... could you carry me?"
//See CCD1001, told you someone was watching. -GHS

And there it begins...

[Taichi]
"OK. C'mere!"

Spoil her a bit, and her mental age just up and deteriorates, doesn't it.
//See Touko... although this likely applies to Youko as well. -GHS
But if no one's looking, I don't mind.
//Of course she gets him to do that alllll day long. -GHS
It's subtle, but there's a version of this BG with lights off (natural daylight only) and lights on (night, now). Power exists here. Of course, the whole thing's just his chuuni game. -GHS
Sigh, so tired.
Neither of my parents are at home.
†††††††††††††††††
//†x17 -GHS
Both of them are working out of country.
//Typical moege scenario. Interesting how Youko's father (that may or may not be Taichi's) is studying in a foreign country. -GHS
†††††††††††††††††††
//†x19 I have nothing out of the last few. -GHS
And because of that, Mimimi's been acting like she was my guardian.
//Misato indeed does, and in many ways is closer to her guardian than Youko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But... if I didn't protect her..."

†††††††††††††††††††††
//†x21 7x3 -GHS
Until she has found happiness,
until some day when she's found a guy she likes...

............
//This part seems to be a dream. I'd say which, but I actually forgot what 'this' referred to between edits. -GHSoHelpful
With twists and with turns we had reconciled.
//"There was more but it's boring so let's just CTRL to the end." -GHS
And then we began erecting the antenna.
For the sake of letting these memories of ours, this friendship of ours, ride the electromagnetic waves of Denpa and scatter out into the world.
//For SYMBOLISM!!!, but also see CCX0001 - the third flow may well be Denpa. Also, "otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth" Gen 11:4 -GHS
That... was a splendid thing.
Senpai---
Touko---
Kiri---
Sakuraba---
Tomoki---
Well then, with all of your strengths, we can do this!
//And another 360 exclusive. I'm SO glad I spent an hour compositing an ugly video screenshot on the 800x600 CG only to hit a 360 graphics file reconverter like two weeks before putting this out completely at random. I google for something like that at least five times dammit! And I still can't use the resulting doll files :-( -GHS
And then we erected a tower.
//He does use a different term (tate) than usual (kumitateru). This is because he's going to build one from scratch, not assembling it. And now the term used is the same used in the Japanese Bible for the Tower of Babel, which I'm sure given this difference is a total coincidence... -GHS
A tower... the symbol of our Club Activities.
//See CCC4009. Bet someone thought the tower wasn't a dick. -GHS
Right now, it's covered with a sheet.
And there, an a-l-i-e-n stormed in.
//See CCC3012B. Oh, it's Alien Storm now? That one was fun. -GHS
I fought it with Karade.
Offense and defense developed with this Worthy Rival both vertically and horizontally.
//See CCC3002, that term was used for Kiri and Taichi. See CCB0005: "The foundation of Karade includes offensive strikes for every direction [...] Similarly, in Karade there exist techniques to control directly above and directly below that could never be conjectured in ordinary martial arts". -GHS
And then, at last, I was united in friendship with the alien as well.
//Developments too fast! Term used also reminds of 'marriage'. Appropriate, since it's Miki. -GHS
Friendship's awesome! Is there anything it can't do?
//fucking shonen shit -GHS
The alien was also Miki. Quantum Mechanically so.
However, aliens are Enemy. That's so sad.
//See CCB0018. -GHS
Therefore, it was a thing of kill or be killed.
............
With the further flowing of time, the antenna achieved its highest purpose.
//It's an odd "to attain" that's used in the sense of "entering Nirvana", as in, to attain the kind of peace that's wished to the dead. It's less odd when considering it's the Tower of Babel. -GHS
However, I will not surrender. I will continue the fight.
Until I have that dream, about silly innocent club activities,
about an ordinary life as if ordinary students.
//Even in absolute madness he doesn't stop, as it's been said about the diaries. -GHS
Memories of being as a person.
And so the fight,
//See CCA0029. Still looking for that wholesomeness. -GHS
continues---
//Wake up. -GHS
I was awake. Yet, the body wouldn't move.
Been so hard now, so I'm gonna go back to sleep!
And then I ended to dive into a Recollection Scene.
//Kaisou, precise exact term used for the sex scene review, you'll see it in scripts with sex scenes. His dreams are flashbacks, of course. But which is the truth and which is the fake... well in this case the answer is both, so it's not that complicated. -GHS
...
......
............
//Back to dream? It's more obvious that the 'evil' parts are just him hallucinating, not the other way around. -GHS
I was standing there.
In front of my eyes was Misato-senpai.
Misato-senpai was Mimi, Mimimi, and Beauty kanji repetition beauty.
//Due to Insaininess. -GHS
My memories of before this are indefinite.
//Those are memories of the Training Camp, see below. -GHS
My Mode is already very much wrong,
//Specific term, which makes even more sense considering it originally was part of the Miki route: Taichi doesn't have a Murderous Maniac mode according to her. -GHS
however, I understand that I have become fairly automatic.
//See CCA0016: he won't do anything to Misato. -GHS
I am camouflaging, using the knowledge and the experience accumulated until now.
//He is camouflaging himself with the experience he's gathered from Japanese pop art, anime and VNs especially. Indeed, but the camouflage is his murderous self! What a spoiler. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"Wh-, what is it... what could... you possibly need from me...?"

Panting, short breath. Furthermore, she seems to be horribly tense.
Right, 'course. It's because I've been playing tag chase with her.
//See CCC0011C, and below. This is nonsense. Misato the drunkard being chased by Taichi all the way up the hokora? She'd die halfway through. -GHS
And at last, I cornered her.
//This is compatible with how Taichi describes the way Misato must've felt after the failed training camp he pushed her into. This is simply the same thing made literal. He's hallucinating that he's done all this literally; Another Story is the story of the training camp. -GHS
A demon of a chance to change who is It.
//Not zooming in on this, it looks like crap. I wonder if the 360 edition has larger doll data files for this stuff, even recorded through mediocre equipment it looks way better than here. -GHS
I approach, and she shakes with a start.

[Misato]
"S-, stay away... let us talk, OK... OK? Peke-kun... calm down..."

And when I noticed, I had a knife 『equipped』.
//RPG terms. He just switched from VNs to RPGs, so blatant! See CCX0001. -GHS
Why are you so demonically attractive, my Senpai.
//My my, is that another Higurashi reference I spot? 魅 is the first kanji in Mion's name, and the whole point of her name is that it has the kanji for Demon in it. It'd fit in the It/Demon pun above, as well as be further hints that the Mion/Shion confusion applies here. ToF is the Higurashi-est that Cross Channel gets, and as I'm fairly sure that Ryukishi got more than a few hints as to the meaning of Channel, I suspect Tanaka also had a hint or three about planned Higurashi event. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hah hah!"

[Dethmisato]
"............"
//These were changed to be a proper sister to Dethomoki, see CCC4025. Hey, still from the same route! But let's keep thinking that this is supposed to be a completely different world; that's totally not a troll. -GHS

With Senpai tied to the back seat, I pedal the bike.
//What's he doing with a bike all the way up there near the hokora? Ah, right, he's on the opposite side of town. Same question. How'd Misato manage to run even more than Kiri in the guesswhatroute? -GHS
I head to the school.
Ah, this scene setting... it gives me paramnesia.
//See CCC3008. Told you it's his medical condition. Now begins him repeating the same stuff regardless of the situation, which is a typical behavior more or less of everyone in the cast. See CCC0045A for more, this may be inherited from his mother. How much repetition was there in those first days, maybe months, of his life? -GHS
Right, that scene where I go to school with my Imouto-in-law.
That is, my Imouto-in-law that wakes me up in the morning, and cracks jokes at me, and makes me breakfast, and with charmful timing rides on the backseat of the bicycle.
//...meaning she comes around too late? Maybe it's the boobs. Sorry: I mean to say, OF COURSE it's the boobs. -GHS

[Dethmisato]
"............"

Recollections that are Clear and devoid of Noise.
//Intentionally odd. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It has?"
//I actually went and wondered why Tanaka didn't make these sentences match the new dialog anyway, but then I realized: this is the beginning of the languages of the Earth becoming confused. Taichi can already no longer understand what other people are saying. This will become literal with Miki. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Really... so much elasticity, it's..."

[Dethmisato]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Breasts... well..."

[Dethmisato]
"............"

Thunk!
Senpai's head, hanging off the flank, smacked into a telephone pole.
//SYMBOLISM!!! Also what a coincidence... -GHS
That Payn was transmitted to me in a Direct way.
//Still intentionally odd. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awch!"
[Taichi]
"All jokes aside, I don't really mind giving you a ride every day, you know?"
[Taichi]
"Besides, don't you just go out every morning but quick and all alone?"
//This wasn't above. -GHS

[Dethmisato]
"............"
[Dethmisato]
"............"
//Notice the lack of "and all that." No (snip) needed here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That person... Touko?"

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Come on now, I told you me and Touko are like whatever. Stop with these weird suspicions already."

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"We are."
[Taichi]
"The point is, I said, that hysteric isn't the kind of girl I like."

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"You serious?!"

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"B-, but I've never had anyone confess to me, not once!"

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Lots of gyarls are keeping in restraint... about me?!"

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Yu-up. I just can't believe that."

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Eh? Whatd'ja say? I can't hear you!"

[Dethmisato]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Owww! That huuurts!"

[Dethmisato]
"............"
//No door slide here. -GHS

School.
Touko.

[Taichi]
"Yoh."

[Touko]
"Taichi...? What... is that... blood...?"
//See CCD0023. Is that error intentional? -GHS

[Taichi]
"What are you talking about now? I don't getcha!"

[Touko]
"What are you talking about? That's blood... what the devil...?"

[Taichi]
"Huuuh? The hell's that?"
[Taichi]
"Of course, Mimimi's just my sister-in-law, but we're siblings you know?"
[Taichi]
"Just helping someone you have a blood relation with getting on the bike isn't... wait, how do you even know that?!"

[Touko]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"So you saw us come to school in bicycle somehow?"
[Taichi]
"But you come to school earlier than me..."
//TL Note: this is how this VN should sound like to the typical person. 1 Cor 14:6-11 is the point. -GHS

[Touko]
"Tai... chi?"

[Taichi]
"From who!"

[Touko]
"Come on, you're kidding me... steadfast now!"
//Dammit, it's Channelkakushi-hen scenario and I can't keep that "lie" literal. See CCD2002 for the point, CCX0001 for the first irony. -GHSob

[Taichi]
"A friend, now, didn't you say they didn't exist to you and stuff? You keeping company with the common folks now?"

[Touko]
"Wah-, aaah..."

[Taichi]
"What's 'ukyu' now. You're blurting out stuff like the heroine of a videogame now."

Take out a knife.

[Taichi]
"...you, you couldn't be burning in jealousy now?"
//Same, zoom's not happening. -GHS

Approach.

[Touko]
"Ah, don't, no......?!"
//And Kirihara Touko just stands there terrified like a little girl, whether she can take him or not. That's so OOC it should come with a laugh track. -GHS

Tomoki and Sakuraba. I approach from their back.
//In a crowded cafeteria? No, in a deserted cafeteria? When are these two ever eating together??? Metaphorically, he'll backstab them. Well, literally-metaphorically-uhm you either get it or it doesn't get clearer, that's it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Did you all watch TV last night?"

The two seemed to be talking about something.
//Words are not only incomprehensible, but male dialogue is just whatever. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hahahah, that's right, that's so right."

I ****ed Sakuraba.
//see, HERE I totally agree they should be reacting to something that isn't their line. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And then I went around the news sites-"

Tomoki let out a groaning voice.
I ****ed Tomoki.
//He just betrays him with his manga stuff and the like. Also, see CCD0022A: what is under that kanji isn't necessarily obvious. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And then I went around the news sites-"

[Dethsakuraba]
"..."
//Ohhh, triple. -GHS

[Dethomoki]
"..."
//Aw, this one I already had. Trade with Dethyusa or Dethyouko! -GHS

We had a fun conversation.
These guys are partners in crime, no mistake there, but both are good guys.
Kiri was there.

[Taichi]
"Kiriii!"

[Kiri]
"...!"

Called out to, Kiri ran away.
Chase.
//No 'tag' side meanings here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Lunch?"

[Kiri]
"Hah, hah...!"
//HINT HINT HINT THIS SCRIPT TAKES PLACE INSIDE THE MIKI ROUTE, NOT BEFORE THE STORY STARTS. -GHS

We run in the long corridors.

[Taichi]
"You have a bento haven't you, Kiri. Sooo nice..."

[Kiri]
"...stay away... stay awaaay!"

[Taichi]
"That's right, in the cafeteria. And yeah, I just about got sick of it."

Run. Run.

[Kiri]
"Hah, hah, hah..."

Somewhere far away an alarm was ringing.
//Nothing more than conjecture on this. The distant place should be the real world. Since she uses a fire extinguisher in this route, maybe she tripped a fire alarm. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Naaah, no need to go that far."

[Kiri]
"Stay away.... hah... stay...!"

[Taichi]
"But once in while'd be nice... I wanna try eating your handmade food, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"A-, anybody!"
[Kiri]
"I'll be killed, anybody!!!"
//But no one exists for her, that's one of her big plot points. It's telling she'd still call out. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeah, I'll be looking forwards to it!"
[Taichi]
"And in thanks... right, yes... I'll give you this doll that I won at the arcade."

Take out knives. Two.
//Why does he have two now? Because two knives is ni-hon *badum-tish*? And how is this related with the now-two flashbangs? (Probably isn't.) -GHS
Run while dangling them from both hands.

[Kiri]
"Hah... hah, ha-, hah, hah..."

Chase. Two people running in the corridors.

[Kiri]
"Hah, yo-, you're insane...!"
//And spin... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dunno... it's some doll. Something from an anime maybe?"

[Kiri]
"Hah, ha... ngh...!"

She stumbles.
//See CCC0011C yet once more. And once again I wonder if this timer girls have before they stumble when chased by monsters has a genetic cause, and why there have been no anime dedicated to researching this mysterious phenomenon. Schools need a Girls Tripping While Chased By Monsters Research Club! -GHS

[Kiri]
"HyAH! Ah, aaah, hah..."

I shrink the distance in a single gulp.
//And where's Nanaka/Youko/self restraint to keep him in check? Well, there's the Of This World thing, I guess, meaning this Taichi doesn't have a soul and is little more than a robot regardless. THIS is what it means for him not to be Taichi proper. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It looks like me? It does? But for starters, my hair isn't white at all!"

[Kiri]
"No, NO!"
//This here zooms on the ground, or rather, scrolls the BG down to see more of the floor. Looks like crap in 4:3, leaving. -GHS

Distance Z-E-R-O.
//The 0 (circle) is gone; but zero has a nice big fat O, doesn't it. Nothing's changed, it's just gotten harder to see. -GHS
Look down,
knives in both hands.

[Kiri]
"Ahah, hahahah... hahah..."

I smile as well.
With this, I can end things without using the knives.
I grab her ankle, and pull her to me.
//Possibly to choke her like, yup, the Miki route. -GHS
Kiri is laughing.
I lean forwards.
84%---
//Conformity Coefficient, if someone forgot. -GHS
The sound of glass being cracked came from somewhere.
//asdfcxpiovjdoaih symbolgasm!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nah, it's not like it's so important... you act that please, I'll get embarrassed!"

[Dethkiri]
"......"
//We unfortunately never get Dethouko, Dethmiki or Dethyouko. -GHS

And Kiri goes to stick her cheek on the floor.
Purr, purr.

[Taichi]
"Ahahah..."

After school. I came to the rooftop.
Youko-chan was there.

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, I sorta wanna see how's things."

[Youko]
"...you......"

She stares fixedly at me.

[Youko]
"Yes... you can't come back anymore."
//Consider the new CCA0022A and this part becomes of fundamental importance: he's redoing here what he did there, but patterned over the failure of the camp. And he murders Youko as she, terrified of him, tells him he can't come back. Did she understand what she had done in those last few minutes? -GHS

Taichi"Uh!......even if you make such a cryful face"

[Youko]
"You don't have long either... you lost even the strength to live as a person... will you be drawn to death, or will you be killed by coincidence?"
//This is a very Nanaka thing to say. Notice that Youko here never uses "Taichi" as pronoun for him as she usually does, always "anata", which is uncharacteristic. Attracted to death is maybe what he does in the Kiri route, when he refuses to follow Kiri and doesn't have the Youko scene; considering Youko is the first killed by coincidence in Miki's route, that's a very odd thing to say for her. If she's been dead all along, these may be her last words. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Help, now... you did say that, but... that time, well..."
[Taichi]
"Miki was still alive..."

The expression on Youko-chan's face freezes.

[Taichi]
"Ah, this doesn't really mean I hate you or anything, Youko-chan, OK?"

[Youko]
"Really?"
//Imagine Taichi's just ranted insanely at her for having looked at him the way she did. And then she realized. And then he still tells her it's all right... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Of course. I love you!"

[Youko]
"If you do... then embrace me. Gently."
//This still means to have sex & to hug. I don't remember if I've pointed it out, but since every third word in Japanese means something sexual, it's sort of a tired gag at this point. -GHS

[Taichi]
"OK. C'mere!"

She draws near. She settles inside my arms.
Youko-chan cries while making no cry.
//Koe mo naku naku. See CCD5001, same behavior. -GHS
I embraced her neck, with strength.
............
Let's erect a tower.
Our tower.
That reaches the heavens.
//Close, but not quite the same Biblical terms: 天に届かせよう. Still the same meaning, and so, here's a PCP from NIV. -GHS
Foolishly.
If I do... I'm sure it won't be lonely.
I shall try to build it, even if alone.
And then, we shall be calling out to the whole Earth.
//Same as above, similar meaning but not quite the same terms as Gen 11 (全地). Still using NIV. -GHS
And in so doing, certainly we---
En route back home, after visiting Tasaki.
Work has progressed.
The materials are still somewhat insufficient, but for now it's going well.
I replenish my stock of food. I pay on credit.
Though it's been long since the world has had its downfall, so isn't credit meaningless?
//So everyone is gone. Except Sakakibara's still around. Sure! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Isn't it, Youko-chan?"

[Youko]
"Yep."

The girl is smiling. It makes me feel so warm.
//And right after killing her to produce the antenna, Youko is a literal ghost, no more real than Nanaka. No other character gets this treatment. -GHS
Gloom. It vanishes soon.
//Positive emotion -> negative emotion because of heavy sense of guilt. -GHSigmund
But why...
...do I post up the memo still---
My chest tightened, for one single instant.
Distinguishing which emotion did that is impossible for the me as I am now.
//See CCX0001. Interesting. -GHS
Soon it shall be dark outside. To be one with the heart.
//Where is it crawling now? Huh? WHERE? IN YOUR SKIN, that's where it's crawling, BITCH. -GHS
Next day.
Classroom.
Waiting.
Sunlight is strong.
Will leave investigating if it's the influence of this heat later. The tower is getting pretty close to the heavens after all.
//Either the sun's... or his fever. That's the term used even in the Bible. ...wait, is this a tower, or is it Prometheus? A new Prometheus??? Well, the tower WAS frankensteined together. *badum dish* -GHS
But once this is complete, the kanji for 'person' will be able to stand on its own.
//See CCB2012. -GHS
This kind of "electromagnetic generation" needs no fees. No such thing as money needed for one's adolescence.
Evil commercialism can go get annihilated. For once I have completed making this take a tower shape...!
//Evil Taichi, in his Typical Moege delusional state, speaks out against the Evils of Commerce. The contempt Tanaka has for this kind of writing is about as transparent as mine. Same word at times used for mankind in the main story. Second part is specific, since he's not constructing a "broadcast tower" in that sense. -GHS
There's no Denpa equivalent of the Mikaka (NTT).
//www.ntt.co.jp - it's written Mikaka because that's what typing NTT comes out like on a Kana input keyboard. This is the reading key for Miki's text, more below when this bout of insanity is described. More importantly, this is the reading key for the damn 'yu', see CCX0001, and more. Laterally it's all about differences of language and Babel, still. ...though I guess that by requiring this halfway language in a translation, the very need for which can be blamed on Babel, we're now into enough meta that the threat to the perduring existence of the space-time continuum have surpassed the Nyan Combined With Meow level. -GHS
Transmitting those is free of charge.
This modern society overflowing with information shall be furthermore polluted by free information!
//See CCC0015B. "A deficiency in morals, an exaggerated selfish individualism, the utilization of fundamental human rights for the purpose of overindulging oneself in laziness". It's all there. -GHS
............
Waiting.
//See CCD3003B. Hmmm. -GHS
Yet there is no change.

[Taichi]
"...hm?"

I felt Miki's presence.
//How? This is absurd! -GHS
I ended up going to Miki's place.
I open the door without making a sound.
//That sounds impossible from the SFX... but that's absent here. -GHS
Miki was on the rooftop.
I also silently came out on the rooftop.
//This seems to be an expansion of what happens at the end of that first part similar to what the second was to the first. -GHS
Miki was standing in front of the "tower".

[Taichi]
"Miki."

[Miki]
"Toimisachini...!"

* "Senpai...!"
//The 360 version has only the scrambled text without subtitles, but if you went in the backlog, you could read (and listen) to the real words. There's even an achievement for that. Like this it's... weak, but I can't imagine any way to make this decrepit old engine make it support anything similar short of having the reader reread the thing twice. -GHS
Miki muttered something.
I don't understand its meaning.
//Because Scrambled By Babel, which in this case is the governmental media. See CCA0020 - someone REALLY doesn't like that stuff. This is different from his inability to understand the deeper meaning of things, however. -GHS

[Taichi]
"To imi sachi? What?
//where [ activates the Japanese accent that turns は ha into ぱ pa. GIS "kana keyboard" for a reference, though I guess it's useless if you can't read kana. -GHS

[Miki]
"Dekuchiha, dekuchika did n'rana dochin?"

* "Wha-, what did you say?"
//Odd implication that she can't understand him, either. The 'did' is left straight, as is the 'wo' particle in the original. The audio is very slightly more comprehensible in that one part. Odd. -GHS
Inn'this weird. They don't sound like the words of a person.
Is this not a person? The possibility exists, definitely.

[Miki]
"Chimishi kakuratoi sorirakakuito..."

* And those clothes...
//Japanese Kimono. Indeed he wears them throughout, see the fire CG just below. But isn't this odd? The point of the kimono is him being a writer (like Tanaka i.e. de-facto god) and a priest (which is foreshadowing for his final role). I suspect this is the troll. And if the kimono is on Taichi and it lies somewhere outside of town, how is it also in Taichi's bedroom? Too much making no sense. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If so... that's an Extraterrestrial Life Form."

It's an Alien!
The smile vanished from Miki's face.
Perhaps having seen through me having seen through her, the smile vanished from Miki's face
//Yeah, it doubled. -GHS

[Miki]
"...tekusuiketo nonisuni?"

* "...where's Kiri?"

[Taichi]
"Right. Is that Spacese?"
[Taichi]
"And you came to challenge me?"
[Taichi]
"However... should you reform yourself, and come join into our Club..."
[Taichi]
"Then we shall erect our Tower, and the greatness of these Activities can envelop our creaking hearts with gentleness."

[Miki]
"...kakuchika korirarashi..."

* "...that blood..."

[Miki]
"Nonisuni! Tekuisui nito tokui!"

* "Kiri! Where is she!"
I head to the tower.
As I happened to pass next to her, Miki took a big leap backwards.
//No suri-ashi? Admittedly this looks slightly better in the console version, as he literally approaches her and she's literally in the way. Contrast Kiri passing him undearm, see CCC3008/3009. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come, see our Tower... the Tower of Friends!!!"
//Black bars due to this existing only at 16:9 ratio. -GHS

I take off the sheet and the incomplete "Tower" came into sight.
This is the masterpiece that came from making the strengths of everybody into one.
//See CCC3002, same word he uses for his uhmmm dick. -GHS
It was hard to work to make it take the shape of an antenna. It could be said it's the first time that we've managed to realize this not despite but because everybody had grown so very rigid.
//Same term used for Tomoki in CCD4025. Pun is because everyone's rigid in thinking and refuses to form into the whole demanded by Japanese culture, due to their human nature, culture which is with the ending of the VN as entirely rejected as the concept of the Harem Ending is in the metaVN reading in favor of the individualizing Christian (and Western) culture, at the cost of separating the Individual from the Group forever, but not in a manner so complete there's no communication. Also, the sky symbolizes sexual awakening. -GHS

[Miki]
"............"

Miki grew befuddled.
With understanding not coming to her, she had halted.
No wonder, just up and being told to understand the culture of another planet has to be rough.
//This is so meta it almost hurts. And that was before I translated it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And when the dawn will break on its completion, we shall be able to speak out towards the whole world."
//Literal because insane. ...except the languages are confused so that ain't happening. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because... I think that's what I need to do for my sake, right now."
//And all in a line that referred to Sakuraba conquering the mountain with his bike, i.e. reaching the outside world and understanding Christianity, because the outside world is Heaven unless it's Japanese Narnia, and the bike is the Way of God but Christianity is Curry, and Taichi is Jesus but purgatory is Gunjou, not the Cross World. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Laaa lalaaa lalalaaa lalaaa lalalaaa laaa laaa laaa laaa lalalaaa laaa laaa lalalaaa!"
//What fun to TRIPLEcheck these... can't see a pattern, if there is, but numbers go らx23 (8x2 +7). Can't tell what song it is, if at all. Doesn't fit the ED that I can tell. So let's go with Morse code! Screw it, he's sending an SOS, right? But whether considering ら=. and ー=-, or ら=. and らー =-, there's little change: ET EET ET EET in unclear patterns. Oddly regular, but this doesn't seem to be it. The real code is more likely the same as with Miki, more below when it's stated more explicitly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Like that."

[Miki]
"...kakuchikaketo chimochitsunimiki."

* "...that's amazing."
//She may be pretending, but did she actually hear him saying 'O' over and over (see below)? Then again, it's Miki; Miki plays along. Also see CCD0022A as redone: Miki may just continue to be a substitute for Yutaka, and this part here is where Taichi shows him the tower. I wonder if this is the same reaction Yutaka had. -GHS
Miki smiled.
There's no understanding of words, but there seems to still be comprehension.
//Shades of CCD0021, though the meaning is just literally the above: comprehension without words, i.e., a basic human nature that transcends culture. -GHS
With this, it seems I can end this without making a show of the Karade of my Pride.
//See CCA0012. Looks like he gave up on "firearms", if you know what I mean, and you do because it's his dick. -GHS
Peace Banzai. The expense of the deployment of troops for the sake of the protection of the peace is had by the dependent nations or should I say the 52 States.
//Evil Taichi is also sorta anti-American. Subtle. A rather obvious 7, plus a rather common error - google '52 states'. So very Taichi. -GHS

[Miki]
"Nakumo... kon kakui techin, nika riraranoto rininoi nrana shinishimakeka natoi nonisenihosokunimimi chito mochikaisunichirito, tora... tekuisuiketo tokui?"

* "Uhm... by the way, it looks like you didn't use Kiri-chin as materials, so... where's she?"
//He pulled off the sheet, showed her the whole damn thing - which is supposedly HUGE, see the next CG - and she didn't see Kiri despite the bodies being damn well visible? This is Shimura Phenomenon - she doesn't have the same image of this tower as Taichi does. Because the tower does not exist, and Taichi's just going "rampant". Hey, after all, this is not much different than using the self-destruct switch back in CCC3002, and she tried to "kill" him there, too. -GHS
For some reason, it feels like she's asking about Kiri.
//He can totally hear her... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...dunno. Haven't seen her."

[Miki]
"Shinishi n'rana mirate."

* "Did you now."
Miki's knees are trembling.

[Taichi]
"Ah!"

Suddenly, I realized:
Kiri was over there. She can't be seen from Miki, she's in a part in the rear.
//...did even Taichi not have a correct image of the Tower as well? I can't imagine this making sense in other ways. See CCC3016. Kiri likes it back there(tm). -GHS
She has been inserted after being machined into the fylfot shape of a swastika.
//Since it's been used literally in CCB0002, here it goes again. -GHS
It's bent and folded here and there but we can say it's still Kiri.
It's After-Kiri, though.
But Miki is an alien therefore there's no need to speak of this, I thought.
//This Settei's just changing at random, is it. And he's justifying not telling her about the change. This is why it becomes hollow to play with Taichi for her. He's just a two-year old kindergardener who just can't admit losing, ever. In that, he's the stereotype of pretentious pseudoliterate imbecile down to a perfect tee. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You cold, perhaps, my friend from Outworld?"

[Miki]
"Mira... teiriri kakuimi, Ni kachinoi mon riichihii."

* "No... well then, I take my leave."

"......"

The moment Miki turned her back on me, thump, she falls to a squat,
seemingly as if she had lost her hips.
//The limit on the Runaway From Monster timer is lowering. Global Decrese in Runaway Time is a phenomenon that NEEDS to be studied! I'm sure I'll get some $1.5bln on Startkicking to finance the research within a day! -GHS
She's muttering about something.

[Taichi]
"What's up? I knew it, walking here's hard for you because the gravity is higher than in your birthplace, the surface of the Moon?"

[Miki]
"...morahii... morahii... morahii... morahii... morahii, mon haiika..."

* "...move... move... move... move... move, my feet..."
//Says below it's because she's in love; but just in a moment, she'll get her feet literally slashed. Is she even replaying Yutaka getting his psychological wound by being tossed down the stairs? -GHS
She mutters something with muttering mutter. This one here's dangerous.
//1) Given below... 2) Naturally ambiguous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, and by the way, don't you think the only good alien is either a dead alien or just an illegal one?"
//It's just a bad pun born from pronunciation difficulties, see CCX0001 for more, in which eiDOrian (Adrian) becomes almost like eirian (alien). Replaced with another bad one. See CC4015, similar to one there. -GHS

[Miki]
"...morahii... morahii... morahii... morahii... morahii... morahii... morahii... morahii..."

* "...move... move... move... move... move... move... move... move..."
//x8. Ah, that's why it won't work. +x5 of above, that's still just 13. For want of an attempt... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, Miki. You're going to participate to Club as well, right?"

As I approach and go to put a hand on her shoulder, Miki stands up with the force of an explosion,
and like that she goes into the school building, with an awkward but quick step.
//The problem here was indeed psychological, IOW no change for all except maybe Tomoki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"W-, wait!"

And she's gone.
............
//Despite having nearly every variation of everything ever and the voices for that damn extra scenario, there's no image of this at night so this is from the 360 version. -GHS
I returned home, gnawed at some potatoes, drank some water, and laid down on the bed.
//Likely raw and to the bud. Now he got POISON!!! status, the moron. Interesting his home is still here, possibly to the west of town. -GHS
Today I met a Non-Terran.
//See CCB2010. So is Miki his hallucination, like Nanaka is...? After all, she's dead, wasn't she. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yet... I must protect it..."

...this blue Earth of ours. From that... kyute Alien.
//Damn colorblind Japs, grumble grumble -GHS

[Taichi]
"What?"

I was all a-flutter.
Is this love? Has it sprouted?

[Taichi]
"Hey! Thinking stops here, it stops!"
[Taichi]
"Get sleeping!"
//See above. The Settei has just changed, as it often does; see CCC3002 again. -GHS

...
......
............
And then I was awake.
//Oh, this used to be a normal "I woke", which Taichi never uses. This change further stresses that this line is not quite intended to be read as it normally is. -GHS
It was still the dead of night.
I had a bad feeling about this.
//More Star Wars? Oh well, chuuni's chuuni. -GHS
My awareness grew sharper and sharper, and spread to cover the entire town.
//No lights on this one. Well, it IS the dead of night. -GHS
...
......
//And there it is, right in front of everyone's faces for ten long years. They forgot to enable the layer with the gate on this one, so there's just the poor wheels down there. This has never been fixed in any version, and boy is it even more obvious in the Xbox 360 version when it's huge on the screen. Despite my uhmmm better efforts, I could not fix this. A minor gripe, certainly, but one nonetheless. -GHS
............
//And so Miki destroys the Tower of Ba-- Friends. Meaning Miki is, if not God, then an angel? Sadly, it's hard to say if this CG shows something obviously absurd or if it's really really cheap graphics. That fire is GINORMOUS and the bodies don't seem to be laid in ways that make sense. And all the visible bodies are obvious, awful 3D models of adult males, when there's only two that could possibly near-fit into that category. Tower of Friends truly got the short end of the stick in every way. More interesting that this shows Taichi is wearing his kimono. But shouldn't he have only worn it twice total? -GHS
Below was removed in favor of visuals. Keeping commented out. -GHS
/At what, 1AM? -GHS
/See CCD5001. But he couldn't smell it when Touko can smell potatoes from halfway through town? -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

It was burning.
The Tower of Friends was burning.
A blazing column.
Smell unspeakable. Heat with pressure.
This thing here's beyond help. This is not a fire at the level where it can still be extinguished. This had been cremated down to ash.
//Word means both "burned down" and "cremated". See CCC4011: interesting he decides to cremate Youko, but no one smells that; if this is a 1:1 replay, as close as it can be, then at the end of all that he might have put Youko on the tower, after which he burned it down. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Fine, I give up."

I have to rebuild it.
Buuut... do I still have materials for that?
They just must be friends.
Friends, but how much longer would they even remain so?
//That only indicates time. If not betrayal or rejection, it's merely them moving on with life. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well..."

However difficult this may be, I must do it.
If I do my best, all dreams can become true. Belief shall become my strength.
//Full of madhouses, 'em self-believing. -GHS
Hope constructs the morrow.
//Nothing to do with CCA0021. -GHS
To let this beautiful Normalcy be filthied and then trampled is out of the question.
//Normalcy is his complex; filthied as in what Youko taught him. -GHS
It is the most supreme decision that can be taken for a person, and that has to be the truth.
Everybody says so, so it's gotta be that.
//What a dumb faddish follower... -GHS
Therefore, if I give it all---
I spread my perception.
I know now that my powers of perception are divinely inspired.
//~troll~troll~troll~troll~troll~ (CP CCC4001) -GHS
Alone in this school building, I head outside.
I feel there's someone in the direction of the town.
In the direction of the City... I have no idea, expectably.
//As it is Heaven. The Bible uses 町 machi for the 'city' that the Tower is to be built with, which isn't either term, though it's pronounced the same as 街 machi (which is used to identify the part of town between the mountains). -GHS
First, let's begin doing our best from the places at hand.
//Because he wants to Make Friends. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Laaa lalaaa lalalaaa lalaaa lalalaaa laaa laaa laaa laaa lalalaaa laaa laaa lalalaaa!"

//Yeah, it's just the exact same thing. Maybe the music changed? Ah, wait, yes it did. -GHS
............
Target caught in the corridor. I become silent.
//Right after he said he was alone and going out. Is he even trying to make sense? The Settei has changed yet again... to the absolute normality. How many times has Taichi found Miki in the corridor anyway? -GHS
I steal up to her back in a lowered position, and slash at legs with knife.
Snap, and her Achilles' Heel is severed.
//Definitely Tomoki now, but Tomoki's wounds (likely) laterally caused by Misato were always a mirror of Yutaka's. More interesting is that she was unable to move before. Unless cause and effect are inverting, something not unlikely to happen in this faux-MWI approach, it may be that above was Yutaka, and this is something else via Misato. -GHS

[Miki]
"GYAH?!"

Scream. That one I could understand.
//There's no distorted version at all of that voice. -GHS
Miki falls straight down on her backside, unable to take so much as one step.

[Taichi]
"Achilleees cutteeer!"
//Special Move. -GHS

I proclaimed the name of the technique in a flat monotone of a Heroic Voice.
//See CCC0016A, where he was replicating the diary content. This is something he's already done. -GHS

[Miki]
"...ah... aaah..."
//No distortion here either. -GHS

But still, don't that falling down on her butt look painful. So pitiful.
//He's worried about her falling down, not the tendons. Probably because he didn't cut her down at all. He's just playing with her like they always do, but he's particularly gloomy so he thinks he's murdering everyone. -GHS
I was apathetically moved. And so I will be a bit more persevering.
//Intentionally contradictory. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And so, won't you become my friend?"
//Odd repetition of 'dakara'. Supposing WeirDz. But Miki IS his friend, isn't she? -GHS

[Miki]
"...toimisachini? Iku... mira techin?"

* "...Senpai? Eh... no way?"
//Just can't keep that damn 'uso' as lie... -GHSob
Miki appears unable to grasp the current condition of her feet.
//Bad puns continue, as well as the idea that this is only psychological for her. No way she can't understand her tendons have been severed. Once more, cause and effect are completely nonsensical. -GHS
I dare say that the origin of that is some sort of Implant. Make no mistake.
//Meaning she'd have some kind of Alien Implant that doesn't let her feel pain. -GHS
No, the origin is rebound. Definitely.
//Whose? -GHS
And then, I knew: we were victims of the Curse of Mikaka, whereas our typing on a Kana keyboard is cursed to output to Romaji and viceversa.
//There we go. This is even weirder and more absurd spelled out for the readers. -GHS
>                     Ooo       OOooo

[Taichi]
"Laaa lalaaa!"
//ら decrypts to the letter 'O'. 0, circle, loop, correct. Same as with how 'zero' is often kept in Western numeral. He's screaming "loop, loop" over and over and over and over and over. Furrygana'd for maximum weird. -GHS

[Miki]
"...!"
//Clear voice -GHS

Limping on her unmoving feet, she works to gain distance.
//And here begins the single messiest scene to recreate in Cross Channel: that Miki CG is HUGE and has seven variants (a number I'm sure is totally random, of course). Fortunately (or unfortunately), most of this stuff isn't actually seen. And that's why they're in the Extras directory! -GHS
>                     Ooo       Ooo       OOooo           OOOooo

[Taichi]
"Laaa laaa lalaaa lalalaaa!"
//Just one last time, either the reader 'gets' it or who am I kidding they can just read the damn notes. -GHS

[Miki]
"Kunasukato... haiika... ratetete..."

* "Hurts... feet... owww..."
//Heh, the 'w' in "ow" ends up like the "te" that is in most of the original "ow"s. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You be a f-r-i-e-n-d!"

Friend by knife.

[Taichi]
"You can gain 300,000 friends throughout the country with just 15 minutes of training a day!"
//Must be Cross Channel Marketing. CCA0005, that's his morning practice after all. Hmmm, how many copies did Cross Channel sell...? Anyway, population of Japan in 1998 was 126,300,000 - number is pretty stable due to low birth numbers - meaning to win over Japan it'd take around 421 days 4+2+1=7. -GHS

[Miki]
"Tokachin kochisono... TOKACHIN KOCHICHICHICHISONO!!!"

* "Stay back... STAY BAAAACK!!!"
//This had a sort of the reverse of the flashback effect, where it grows into a circle at the center of the screen. It's cute, but it's not much different here. -GHS
I install a knife in Miki. Around the thigh.
//And Miki, who is God by virtue of destroying the Tower of Babel, now gets tortured in what is effectively a crucifixion. ...it does sound stupidly blunt when said like that. Except, this should be a replay of the very end of the new CCD0022A. Who was being tortured there? Not Yutaka, he survived. If Miki was Yutaka above, then who is she now? Outside of Youko, getting brutally and sadistically murdered (but not forgiven) for what she did to him, I have no idea. -GHS
There was no slot, so it necessitated installing a new one.
//You'll break your brand new PC, Misato! See CCD1001. -GHS

[Miki]
"CHICHIchichichiku!!!"

* "AAaaah!!!"
Juiciness without end on removal.
A kick came aimed at the face.
When her tendon is severed, amazing! Miki has some genius in her.
//See CCD1001: more miracles? Or see CCD4022. Genius by fail. More likely, she's getting tired of this rough horseplay. There's no murdering, but he's passed the boundary. That's mass murder to him. Maybe. -GHS
Therefore, I had the edge of the blade stop the sole of her foot.
Autoskewering.

[Miki]
"Chiku......"

* "Ah......"
Miki goes to stare at her own pierced foot, dumbfounded.
On removing the knife, Miki's foot fell down on the floor with a thump, as if it had perfectly died.
//Or, as if their game called for it. She's not that much in pain, is she. She probably whined more in her sex scenes! -GHS
Seems making friends is simple.
I decided to slowly progress on the deed.
I understand that "this" is not something to be so afraid of.
But it seems I have some measure of talent for it, I haven't felt terror not once.
//See CCD0022A: he broke himself first. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Laaa..."

I hold a knife in each respective hand,
//As with Kiri? -GHS
I ought drain the blood.

[Miki]
"Tekun... tekun?"

* "Why... why?"

[Miki]
"Tekun... shinishimikeka Ni... manatoka nimomoishinichikairin sunami chitechin... nrana nomirate, toimisachini?"

* "Why... didn't I... just immediately run away... you know, Senpai?"
//NOT "why are you doing this". Interesting. -GHS
First, tear off the clothes.
//"You're pretty, so off with the clothes". Hmmm. -GHS
Opposition was already vanishing.

[Miki]
"Tekuimi Ni kurarishi montoiriha... tora sesuisoniranato..."

* "When I hold myself... so precious..."
//Still her own route's arc. -GHS
The † flashes.

"Tora Ni kakuranakikuka, niha nonisuni techito chirinihii, kakuimi..."

* "But I... I also prepared myself to burn it all down..."

[Taichi]
"?!"

Miki's hand moved.
Attacked while off guard.
//嘘をつかれた "I was lied to" looks so similar it may not be coincidental. -GHS
A heavy impact on the side of the head, enough that the center of the brain could come out.
//See CCX0001, as well as many parts of Week 1. That's where the Cover-Up Lobe(?) of his brain is. See CCD1001: that's where his automatism is. She's not attacking to kill him; she's attacking to make him regain his sense of reality. That's what the whole thing about universes changing and the Shimura Phenomenon means. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

I lean over with a violent shake. Vision grows dark.
I just barely avoided losing consciousness,
but, I unconsciously dropped the knife and laid the hand there.

[Taichi]
"...ah, aaah..."

There's a baton in her hand.
//Supposing it's a foldable. Like the fan in the Touko blowjob scene, this is never heard or mentioned again; then again, this so damn metaphorical it's absurd to even think of taking this literally. What she did was similar to what Taichi does to Sakuraba: did Taichi literally beat Sakuraba's automatism out of him? If so, given Sakuraba doesn't recover 100%, that'd still be not enough, perhaps explaining why Taichi still goes mad after ejecting Youko, and why Sakuraba wanting to abandon the city equals death. -GHS
That is what smacked my head.
However, she can't brace with the lower part of the body and convey her full strength.

[Taichi]
"Well don't that hurt now...!"

I take a breath, and throb!, the pain runs.
//See CCA0027. And around it goes. -GHS
I touch, and blood is coming out.

[Taichi]
"This is gonna swell, you know!"

But still there's pain. Is it this that time-delay trick where I have a bout of emesis and die several hours later?
//As in, the tip of the nightstick was poisoned? Perhaps he's rationalizing having eaten the potatoes raw to the bud (no I'm not letting that go, he started it!). -GHS
Well, if I've managed managed to find out that much I won't die, so I'll be alright.
//I suspect the above is when the game ends, as Taichi went a little too hard on Miki - see CCC3012A, when he does, she just smacks him hard, meaning this stopped just like it did in CCA0016. The below is just him still hallucinating he doesn't stop. -GHS
Naah.
Naah, naah.
No more, now.
Now... I'll be making you into a friend.
A silent safe friend.
A friend that will live on inside me for all eternity.
//The kind he likes... the perfect kind, the one who never contradicts him or says anything annoying or pesters him when he doesn't want to. A thing. -GHS
†---

[Miki]
"...mikiku..."

* "...ngh..."
The blood spreads.
//It may be censorship, it may be bad design, but it's odd that there's a ton of blood below her yet all those stabs look no more than papercuts. May be whatever, but if it's intentional... -GHS
Throughout the corridor it spreads.
Throughout the world it spreads.
Throughout everywhere it spreads and everything it becomes. She's like a blood bag.
//Women are convenient bloodbags for men. -GHS
Friends don't need blood. Cannot do anything but believe, I guess.
//See CCD5001: perfect Youko doesn't need love, just like Alter Egos don't need anything but reciprocal assertion. That's exactly the same as people not needing blood to be friends. -GHS
However, this is still not perfect.
And I, with all my might, gave one last †.
In the deepest depths. Miki released a narrow and long grunt.
And then,

[Miki]
"...tekuimi Ni rirahiishi nrana---"

* "...when I loved you---"
CIN 0 0 -200 0 0
CR 3
//I never thought it could do this. -GHS
The † stops.
Against my will.

[Miki]
"...tekuimi Ni nonimishi raha rirahiishi nrana toimisachini..."

* "...when I kind of loved you, Senpai..."

[Taichi]
"............"

Body doesn't move.
As if it had been numbed.
CIN 0 0 0 0 -200
CR 3
But slowly, freedom returns. I become able to move.
After all, they're my muscles, aren't they.
//His volition and freedom is now into the "evil". This contradicts much of what's been seen of him. Of This World indeed. -GHS
And therefore, shall we not continue with our club activities?
//Random formal. Seems inspired by Misato's words. -GHS
I use.
//The cross mark has been removed, how suspicious. -GHS
I use nice and well.
And then,
†

[Miki]
"............"

The use is finished.

[Taichi]
"............"

How long have I even stood there. It had become morning.
//Since time has little meaning... an hour? -GHS
I feel sick, horribly so. As if to throw up.
//Hi, Touko. That's what the time-delay above means. -GHS
Shirking from the scorching sunlight like an insect, I take distance from that spot.
............
I satisfy my starvation at a shop.
I look at the memos.
Right, that's how you go post up credit bills..
//I suspect that, in the simplest troll (that the Cross World is a physical place and ToF takes place in it, with a completely separate but overlapping cast), this is who posts up the memos. In various people's names. For no reason whatsoever. And he apparently mostly got vegetable juice. That, or time will mysteriously start looping from the previous Sunday when the parallel world people get here and then this Taichi puffs out of existence like everyone else for no explained reason. Or dies and falls into a ditch and doesn't get reset and somehow grows old for same. -GHS
All those are as if events of a distant past, so nostalgic.
I took the pen with shaking hands.
Roaming.

[Taichi]
"............"

It's pretty quiet.
Nothing but the zealous hot hair of Summer pouring on, as every year.
Perhaps a bit of rationality has returned, together with the sweating, as I was oddly composed.
Humanity had fallen in the blink of an eye. Origin remains not understood.
//Pshaw, this is so obviously the Settei changing that it barely bears belaboring at this point. See CCC0006B, same trick as with Nanaka: although the term can imply either knowledge or understanding, Taichi knows, but doesn't necessarily understand. Plus, we had the Tower event, that comes AFTER the flood, not before! -GHS
The population declined in the blink of an eye.
//Since he usually uses something to the effect of "fallen" or "annihilated", it's not often clear that it's also metaphorically talking about the birthrate and population decline of Japan - but it is here. -GHS
It wasn't something that could be dealt with, either.
//This can mean himself, but also as far as the political and cultural levels. -GHS
No one's survived, I guess. No one.
And the moment I saw that composition, I---
//The Ironic Composition of just these eight damaged people being left, perhaps, except there's at least Sakakibara left. But it's also further hints that he possibly didn't kill anyone at the Hasekura mansion, he just began 'ignoring' people. -GHS
Even the strength to make my best effort flies away, leaving behind no trace.
I'm afraid to go inside the house,
because there's no certainty body of Mutsumi-san won't be in there.
//Intended to be read that he murdered her. See CCC3012B, which is similar to this in many ways: he's actually afraid she's in there, perfectly alive, and since he can't deal with all that, the game'll be up and he'll be "dead". -GHS
My recollections aren't definite on this.
//This is among the most meaningless things that Taichi could ever say. -GHS
...I can't go inside.
It feels like the composure I have now would, itself, quickly vanish as well.
//...because she's there welcoming him and the game'd be up... -GHS
............
The hill road. Wherever I should be going now I can't determine.
My feet move absent-mindedly.
Hot.
Head hurts.

[Taichi]
"............la."

>  O
La?
//Reminder that this sentence is extremely meaningful. -GHS
............
Shopping street.
There's no one.
//It's a bedtown in the middle of the morning, of course there's no one. -GHS
Anyone...
............
On the outskirts of town, passed the bridge, I stand still.
//West town, should be around where Kiri practices. -GHS
The fragrance of green enveloped the heart, if just a little.
//Hum, this might be reminding him of Youko. See CCA0002. -GHS
The hell's up with this world.
All of a sudden a really ugly feeling squeezes out of me,
and I taste the coal tar that had been stuffed at the deepest depths of this sweet flavored tube of toothpaste.
//Lonely world's got a bitter aftertaste indeed.　See CCX0001: that'd be his deepest layer. -GHS
Ahhh, really, why does it always end up like this?
Everyone's gone mad.
Therefore, I'm the only one that's normal, definitely.
//Ironically... -GHS
I wish I hadn't been born as anything remotely human---
//More suggestions that his is just pretending to be an insect pretending to be human. -GHS
...
......
............
And then I noticed it had become morning. I was sprawled down, as if dead, in an open field. It felt like being slapped awake up by a headache.
//See CCX0001 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan... Youko-chan..."
//That's the very last person he should be calling for! This is still replaying the end of the Shinkawas. -GHS

[Youko]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Head... hurts..."

Just like that time.
//Ibid. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I got wrecked... again."

Youko-chan was already no more.
//He's killed her here, did he kill her there? -GHS
        『Tekuimi Ni rirahiishi nrana---』
What's even up with that weird romaji.
//hee hee -GHS
I don't get what it means.
Wandering.
Wandering.
Wandering.
I was roaming about downtown, and when I approached the hill road,
someone called out to me from behind.

[Taichi]
"............"

For a while I stood there, stopped.
I was exhausted, to the point where I could no longer evaluate presences.
//He can no longer tell which is friend from which is not. This is where his game just breaks. -GHS
Obeying instinct, I replenished fluids alone, but... my heart, by now, long since had its layout damaged.
//Odd "alone" there, but see Touko, who subsists only on water. Is he starving himself as well? Ahhh I get it now! It's high noon and he'd sell his soul for water! Last part has sort of computer-ish terms still. -GHS
Regardless, I was spoken to.
//That voice happened how long ago now? The discrepancy is easily understood with the 0.108 ratio: people in the 'real' world would move around 7 times faster than him. He called him, but if he doesn't know these rules, he'd stand there still for minutes, unresponsive. -GHS
This voice... it's Sakakibara-sensei's.
//See CCC4025. -GHS
Well then, this means there's still survivors.
He is not a Friend, however.
//That doesn't mean any weird thing; see CCC0011A. Teachers won't be Friends, especially someone as antisocial as Sakakibara is (or might be, it's not like "his" diary is all that credible). -GHS
Sensei said something about the rooftop and something about Miki, I think.
//"Don't go to the rooftop, also, you spooked poor little Miki dammit". He may be looking for him as he left school. -GHS
I parted my parched lower lip from the parched top lip and spoke to him.
//He just said he replenished his fluids! He must've stood there for hours! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Teacher, please become my friend."

I wait for quite a while,
yet no answer came.
I turned around, and no one was there.
//The guy likely left when he saw that Taichi wasn't responding. It's possible that what he said was nothing of what he said; we're post-Babel now. No one can understand others anymore. -GHS
I could not find a trace of the teacher. But he would've had business with me, wouldn't he.
//IOW, he didn't kill him at all, unless "started ignoring" (perhaps due to them not moving at his speed) means killing. Reminds of Nanaka, see CCA0023, and also of Youko. Very interesting, isn't it. -GHS
How much time have I even stood still there?
//We're under "loop" effect, time is no longer coherent for him. Which hints that Teachers can't become Friends because they won't respect the Rules. -GHS
It's possible that---
Yes, it's possible that---

[Taichi]
"Anyone."
//And still he seeks people. -GHS

It's all done now.
............
And then I noticed that I had treaded into the mountain path.
//Same "and then I noticed" as above. He instinctively goes to the hokora, following the hint of his dead mother, although she isn't personified quite yet. -GHS
The headache still hasn't lessened.
//The memory center is stimulated, see CCX0001. -GHS
The side of the head that a someone had smacked is now aching all throbby-throbby.
//See CCA0027, the SFX is the same Miki uses there. It may just be that the smacking of his head all along was nothing but an attempt at replicating what he misremembers to have 'caused' Miki's happy face at the end of that scene, which got conflated with this. That still works since this entire thing is still supposed to be around the Miki route. -GHS
Head feels like it would blow up.
Each step echoes in the head,
but this wandering of mine I can't stop.
Maybe if I were to stop I would come to a halt.
//Laterally. See CCD5001: he moves onwards. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hurts."

???: "Are you alright, Peke-kun?"
There was nobody there.
//Or was there? That'd explain what Misato is doing there at the start: it was always the start, it was always the camp, and it's just a metaphor for how he hurt her. He's reliving that moment. -GHS
............
//Notice how it's evening now. No coincidence. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...where am I?"

???: "At the ho-ko-ra!"
//Tags were removed now that there's a visual guide. This Taichi here can't know who Nanaka is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I know that much. Tell me something I don't know!"

???: "Something I don't know!"
//Dammit mom! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, who're you?"

???: "Nanaka."
//Half-jokes aside, the point here is that Nanaka doesn't know anything Taichi doesn't know, her being a memory and all... and she knows her name. This might've been more important before readers knew who and what she was, i.e. the Miki route. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

She vanished.
............
I was walking unsteadily down a road, off someplace I don't know,
me with nothing but a headache and the memory of a sense of loss.
//As it's written with the kind of 'loss' usually seen in 'memory loss'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

That shouldn't be a person, definitely.
//Likely speaking about himself, but he might be speaking about the people he sees/doesn't see right about now. -GHS
If there are no people, there is no need to follow this husk-like etiquette.
It would be a play with no script nor stage, literally meaningless.
//Lateral... but not much. -GHS
There'll be no one to listen, either.
//Though there's no guarantee for people to listen to the "radio", which in Week 1 (and most weeks) didn't literally have a script either. I would suspect Tanaka sort of wings it and hopes, but with the mess of cross-references, it sounds hard to believe. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

Go and vanish.
Go and vanish, everybody.
That's what I wished for,
for all in the world to just vanish from in front of me.
//With more than a little hint that, currently, it IS actually in front of his eyes. This is the end of the Training Camp. -GHS
I break into a run.
Extraordinary pain reverberates throughout the center of my head.
I don't care and run.
I looked over the town---
And that instant, something happened.
//Very interesting the above, isn't it. Past and present collide, unless this was always the present, and so was that. This is where The Switch takes place. But what, exactly, switches? -GHS
Someone, possibly the god called coincidence, overlapped two sheets of paper and shoots 'em dead with a thumbtack.
//That last term is seen at the end of CCA0013, when Taichi wins over Yusa's favor with a single handkerchief (which is usually found folded, dot dot dot). Though it does literally mean "to shoot dead", it is most often used in this meaning of "conquering/overcoming" or "winning [over]". -GHS
And on that, 8 presences appeared.
//Yu. Look at this troll: eight *presences*, not eight people. What's not immediately clear is that Nanaka is also inside of the Cross World, see CCD0023 for the most explicit hint. That's eight presences total with her, plus Taichi makes nine. That one or two of those presences are actually his delusions is not contradictory. -GHS
I instantaneously suppress my presence. It's instinct.
//Also, God put the remaining people there for him, not his simple observation. This is consistent with CCC3009. -GHS
Eight presences.
No... it's impossible.
I could never do something as skillful as incarnate a presence,
although the virtual image of a concept would be different.
//No lies still: the embodiment of a presence would require others to see the person. No one sees Nanaka but him, and all he does for Youko is either dress up as her, or fake out people seeing her when she isn't there. Plus, no one but the six people known to play along with him ever even hint at seeing or hearing of her. Those are the virtual images of concepts, namely his own tragedy (Youko) and his own salvation (Nanaka). No more. However, the troll is that he's just hallucinating them after murdering everyone, but I suspect few will be fooled by that at this point. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngggh... ngGhhh..."
//x8 -GHS

I descend the mountain. With quick feet.
//Remember how the Training Camp ends: with him running off ahead. The whole thing about them deciding to do things in reaction to the disappearance of mankind may be just his rationalization of things they had already settled on doing. -GHS
Everything's going to hell in a handbasket.
There is nothing that I can rely on anymore.
//Nothing that can save him... nothing he can be sure of. -GHS
I should probably not investigate presences anymore.
//Well how convenient now! -GHS
I'm scared.
Because it's scary.
............
//Not once but twice. Just what the hell were they doing? -GHS
I came to school so that I could run away into it.
//Like Misato. The thing about the subdivision of duties probably happened long before. After all, there's no Fall of Mankind, is there. -GHS
I go to the corridor, so that I could meet Miki.
If she did not move, then she should've still been there,
//That if... -GHS
and yet.
Miki had become eternal.
//See CCC3022. Crystallized into a single moment... meaning she's looping and resetting... meaning she's not dead and never was. -GHS
When one becomes eternal, they have no cadaver.
//So she was crucified, and then got up and walked away. Oh and the gate of school, which would be her tomb, was open. It's unclear how much time has passed, but assuming the murder is on the night of Wednesday, and the resurrection on the dawn of Saturday, that's three days. 72 hours outside of the loop would be between 7 and 8 inside, so that sounds right. And so, she's been crucified, and after roughly three days the tomb is found empty. All of this rings a bell. -GHS
It's not necessary.
//But I have to love how Tanaka doesn't limit himself at trolling those who think this is sci-fi, but also those who'd resort to simplistic pseudoreligious explanations, like making the post-Flood word read so much like a post-apocalyptic (and un-Biblical) Rapture. -GHS
For that is what eternity does.
As she was Eternalized, Miki not being there when she shouldn't have been able to move is something I can accept.
//Troll is the World Switch, see CCD0022A and 23, when the same thing happens. The simple answer is that, if she ever was there, she just got up and left many hours before. This was nothing but a weird corridor play like many in the main scenario. -GHS
And so, I thought, that's good.
Honestly, it'd be tough to look at Miki's After-Miki.
But if it had been Before-Miki it'd have been nice.
//Alive... but back when she was a loli might've been nice *hubba x2* -GHS
Truly, I thought that.
Why?
Why did that child just have to become a sacrifice?
//I suspect the impersonal here means he's switched subjects from Miki to whoever Miki is representing in the mansion massacre, likely Youko, possibly Yutaka. -GHS
I begin to feel sick.
That is something absolutely out of the question to even think of forgiving.
//Rather mangaesque now. Intentionally ambiguous as to whether he means having made her into sacrifice, or feeling sick about it. Both are valid: Miki's not dead, so feeling sick about something he hasn't done is meaningless; Youko did really horrible stuff to him, perhaps worse than Yutaka did, so in a sense him regretting it ought be at odds with secular morality. -GHS
This is las unforgivable las the grammar nazis would consider ladding "la" to lall the words that starts with l-a.
//Ranuki kotoba, see CCC4010. That's where all the 'ra's come from. This sounds only moderately less insane in Japanese. -GHS
Therefore I shall keep singing out and loud my "LA".
Dried-up blood, that brings me back. But I wish all had become like this.
//So the blood is actually there. Or is it? Miki's definitely not being honest on this being Sakakibara's blood, if she's being honest about it not being paint in the first place, see CCB0008A. -GHS
And as I was, my feet moved towards the rooftop.
//Yes, the antenna is just right there. As it perhaps always was throughout. -GHS
There was no Tower of Friends.
Because it had burned down.
But then, there's no wreckage either, how come?
//A word that turns up in pretty nice moments, that, in particular it's used to describe their friendship in CCA0030. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

Not even a trace of it.
//The world we've seen so far had one very big oddity: it had not even the shell of the unbuilt antenna. And yet he placed his Tower just on the SAME SPOT where the Antenna would be. No coincidence, not when Miki's blood apparently persists in this Crossing. Wonder if that paint spill got somehow Fixed long before the story starts. Maybe there's just some girl in a class nearby who likes to spill paint. -GHS
I could neither understand nor accept.
I became afraid.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid.
It's the Shimura Phenomenon.
//See CCC3019A. IOW, it's because he stopped seeing his own damn chuuni world. Miki smacking him in the head actually worked! -GHS
Once you notice it, all is Downfall.
//Meaning he was doing all that stuff to avoid accepting that his friends are no longer on good terms and that his 'eden' is lost. It's as upfront an admission as there are, here. This is why he doesn't want to go inside the house and meet Mutsumi, or why he must 'reset' if "shot" by Kiri, whatever that really means. Also, he has this possibly prophetic concept of them all coming back together to assemble the antenna, although the first version is less than healthy. -GHS
............
In this hour when the dense night has painted out even the brilliant scarlet, I sprawl out in my home that is also the field in the outskirts.
//Scarlet = blood. Recreation of internal red via time aphasia to dodge the unmanageable real evening. -GHS
I can't put strength into myself. Headache's terrible too. I can't move.
//This was what he was at the start, when he began the recollection scene. Sooo... has it ended? -GHS
All that I could do was to remember, nothing more.
//I suspect it has, and it has ended now. -GHS
Memories. Those and only those may be my salvation.
//Term is also religious, of course. -GHS
If I wander about, and go meet them, I might just end up taken by some terrifying madness.
//He's even scared to do harm to people he supposedly brutally murdered minutes ago. He knows nothing's happened, and what we saw are just his fears. That's what holds him afloat, in a sense, this regret for what he's done and for what he could do again - or at the very least, for what he imagines he could do, and might one day do for real. -GHS
This is enough. I want it to end.
//See CCC3022. This isn't what Youko had in mind, I suspect. -GHS
And it could be that I had a vision of pleasant fun days. And depicted them. And yearned for possibilities.
//Vs. the fixed existence. -GHS
And I pasted together this Patchwork-like thing. And
that I unleashed gags and that I sexually harassed.
//This was added in CCX0001 as well. -GHS
Even if it wasn't perfect, there was no mistaking how these were fun possibilities.
//A simple Trollsplanation is that he killed everyone and all that's happening in the main VN is him hallucinating from this point before he dies. But if he finds peace in his last moment before death, not much changes, philosophically speaking, making it a double troll regardless. -GHS
Humans're amazing.
Bonds're amazing.
Person and person supporting each other like the kanji're amazing.
//This is repentance. -GHS
Truly... amazing---
And from then, how many hours did even elapse.
//This may be where he wakes up from the dream waaay above. -GHS
I remained there, in that place, as I was.
What day was even today...?
I lost my sense of weekday.
//Long ago, given everything. Term still relates to Youko. Maybe she was just named after that, back at the Mansion. -GHS
This sensation like I've become something no longer human is all there is.
And if I'm not a person, what am I?
//If this is 1, what is this? -GHS
A god?
Who'd ever say that kind of stale hackneyed line.
//Of course, he's no god; that'd be still Nietzscheianism. He's the representative of the technical equivalent, doing like said equivalent his best to follow the Real one. -GHS
God is a Phenomenon,
//See CCD0009 now. This is simply assertion based on nothing. -GHS
therefore, I might just be Phenomenon myself.
//However, he's agreeing that he's a god with this. In other words, he's trolling himself. -GHS
That explanation was a tasty delicacy.
//Try empty calories. -GHS
Hot.
Sunlight.
Burning me.
I am burning.
Because I'm a sinner.
//Welcome to hell. -GHS
Just recompense.
But... it hurts.
        『Tekuimi Ni rirahiishi nrana---』
Those words alone, oddly, remain.
Right. Because I should've heard those correctly.
I remember,
and slowly, carefully,
scoop them right up.
         『Tekuimi I lohiishi nrana---』
           『Tekuen I lohiishi you---』
              『When I loved you---』
In these hands of mine that I'd shaped into a bowl these beautiful words glittered and sparkled like water in the desert.
//See CCC4023. She loves him, although he doesn't believe her love to be quite 'true', Miki's the closest to a proper wife as he'll find. More importantly, even as he is, he still finds someone who'll love and forgive him. And the peanut persimmon tree may be real. And the fruit it'll make is the fruit of knowledge. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You loved... me?"

Speaking smarts.

[Taichi]
"This... me here?"
[Taichi]
"Ahhh... ahhh... so happy... I'm so happy..."

I'm so happy.
Don't wake me if it's a dream... no, rather, wake me.
Because the world's making me this much happy.
Because I now have the joy to persevere in this daily life of perfect normality again.
As I think I should be able to make things go well next,
//See CCD0022A. He's not healed, not by far. -GHS
I want to do this all over again.
And so even if I had this idea of wanting to reincarnate into a pond snail and live my life without having anything to think about at all, maybe it would just be nice if I were to be a human again, I think.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viviparidae Pond snail = Tanishi, written with the same 'ta' as in Tanaka. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hahah..."
[Taichi]
"......hah......"

The headache and the heat, by now,
are making me see all sorts of illusions.
I fired off into ramblings, incapable of self-awareness.
The heat makes sport of me.
The brain melts.
But at last, I will, just a little---

[Taichi]

            Additional commentary
               by Tanaka Romeo
This additional scenario, Cross†'Channel, was
originally a rejected scenario idea.
//See CCA0016. Although called Another Story in the 360 menu (and here), the scenario name that pops up when starting is still that. -GHS
It was initially considered as an alternate
possible route for chapter "Invisible Murder,
Invisible Tears", but had this been included,
the Miki route alone would have become far too
extravagant, and keeping in consideration how
the viewpoint tricks didn't have much of a
point, it was removed from the specs.
//See CCX0001. This actually underlines what that line meant - it's lingo. The viewpoint tricks would be the beginning moege and the denpa moege, but also all the stuff above being just his hallucination isn't impossible. -GHS
Furthermore, there are elements that also
serve as payoff for foreshadowing such as
the body beyond the river, Taichi's white
hair and kimono, and "Mimimi".
//Given the sentence above it's actually not quite clear whether any of those things are actually intended to have payoff here or whether these things are more troll. The body beyond the river being nonexistent makes more sense as it reveals Miki's lies and Kiri's credulity, though Taichi's white hair and kimono would be what makes Kiri and Miki think it's him in a simpler (but false) explanation; the name Mimimi doesn't have any meaning that's explained here. Curiously, 兼ねて also means "to find difficult", but outside of blatant troll, I can't see where that reading would fit. -GHS
The Miki Route was, from the start, conceived to
add a flavor of suspense to the taste of the loop
phenomenon, in short it was arranged for there to
be one more suspect for the identity of the killer
of the members.
Around midway through plotting there was also this
concept of "Taichi B recovers and then, with
everyone..." However, this part has
not been written.
//Besides, it's still not as trolly as the Sakakibara diary. -GHS
