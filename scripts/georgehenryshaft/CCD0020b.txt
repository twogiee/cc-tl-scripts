I whistle through my fingers.

[Taichi]
"Youko-sensei!"

[Youko]
"...you rang?"
//I soooo haven't found a trace of the Japanese translation of that. Well, at least it's classy. What, none of you can tell the reference? For shaaame... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mimi-senpai is going to get injured on the rooftop, prevent it."

[Youko]
"...should I rescue her?"
//Not the same as preventing it, and she's right, see CCD0020A. No injuries, no progress; that's why in CCD1001 it ends up like that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Indeed."

[Youko]
"Got that."

And that part is fine.
............

[Taichi]
"Ah."

I discover Touko,
walking in my direction at an unsteady stagger.

[Taichi]
"That gal's amaaazing this week!"

Can't let this go without helping.
//No negatives here, none. -GHS

[Taichi]
"My dear, you have quite the willpower y-e-s!"

I drew closer.

[Taichi]
"Have this to eat, oh starving person."

[Touko]
"...stop this."

A swat of her hands.

[Taichi]
"You're not eating properly, are you?"

[Touko]
"That's... none of yer business."

Walking in a widdle and with a waddle.
//Like drunk Misato. -GHS
I follow behind her.

[Taichi]
"Having no human alive, none outside of you, that worry about you... it's painful, right?"
//This older revision had a comma missing. -GHS

[Touko]
"What's that even mean I don't know."

[Taichi]
"You want people to worry about you."
[Taichi]
"You want to be fulfilled."
[Taichi]
"You want them to look at you."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And me, I'm getting somewhat worried here."

She sternly glares at me.

[Touko]
"Look... who's talking."

Something close to hatred gets caught between those demarcated words.

[Touko]
"If you're worried, then why, why!"

She loses her temper.

[Taichi]
"...Kirihara."

[Touko]
"What now!"

[Taichi]
"Your face looks off-color. Menses?"
//Yup, here he's gotta be really worried. -GHS

Smaaack!

[Touko]
"Aren't you stupid!"

That curse spat out, she leaves.

[Taichi]
"Ah, the sandwich..."

I sigh.

[Taichi]
"...that ain't a really good way to die, me."
//Maybe older revision, maybe it just changed. -GHS

I pull myself together and---

[Taichi]
"Hey, unyielding girl with the Reversible Character Attribute!"
//Tho technically it's CP CCB0015B CPing CCA0014A, but we're recursive enough. -GHS

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"I told you I'm giving you this."

I present her with the sandwich.
Touko gazes at it, flabbergasted.

[Touko]
"What's this, even?"

[Taichi]
"Anman."

[Touko]
"'s not that at all you know!!! It's a sandwich you know!"

[Taichi]
"So you do know don't you."
[Taichi]
"Have it."

Slid over,

[Touko]
"...stop this."

It was brushed aside.
//Really, that's it? C'mon, this is lazy... -GHS
The bag falls,
recovered.

[Taichi]
"That wobbly unsteadiness of yours is probably 'cause you're starving yourself."

[Touko]
"That's... none of yer business."
//these are even the exact same speech files as just earlier in the script. It's sooo lazy. -GHS

Uncooperative.

[Taichi]
"You worry me ya know."
[Taichi]
"And because of all that's happened here, can't you just sort of be happy, or something?"

[Touko]
"What's that even mean I don't know."

[Taichi]
"I... like you ya know."

Smaaack.
Staggering.
This time, it did not hurt in the slightest.

[Touko]
"...ngh..."

Right after this strike, Touko collapses sitting on to the floor.

[Taichi]
"You OK?"

[Touko]
"...nh..."

Holding her eyes shut, her face almost colorless.

[Taichi]
"...Touko."

I crouch next to her.

[Touko]
"Don't address me without honorifics, you..."

So she says as if squeezing it out.
In that moment, sweat surfaces on her forehead.

[Taichi]
"Where does it hurt?"

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"Don't try it when you're like this. Truce, we're in a truce."

Because there are no doctors anymore, now.

[Taichi]
"TOUKO!"

[Touko]
"My eyes, I can't see..."

[Taichi]
"Whaaat?"

Malnutrition-induced loss of eyesight?
She's shivering.

[Taichi]
"Anything else? Is there any other problem healthwise?"

[Touko]
"I feel nauseous. I feel dizzy... like to throw up."

[Taichi]
"Want to throw up?"

[Touko]
"...no!"

[Taichi]
"Then lie down now."

Urgently.
Touko had no resistance.

[Taichi]
"Eyes?"

[Touko]
"All dark..."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm..."

Loss of eyesight... but it's kinda sudden for that, isn't it.
Assuming it is for the moment, anything is preferable to serious illnesses or external damage that reaches internal organs.

[Taichi]
"Stay composed now. It's not something to panic over."

[Touko]
"......I'm fine."

[Taichi]
"Anything out of the ordinary physically in the last few days?"

[Touko]
"Nothing."

[Taichi]
"Did you get some powerful medicine or something poisonous on the eyes?"

[Touko]
"None, no."

Really all of a sudden then.

[Touko]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"What is it?"

[Touko]
"I think I'm starting to see something now."

Relief.

[Taichi]
"Then this was just anemia, maybe."

[Touko]
"Anemia?"

[Taichi]
"The symptoms seem to be all there. It should also cause your feeling of nausea, you know."
//Just a な at the end... -GHS

[Touko]
"Right..."

[Taichi]
"How's your nausea?"

[Touko]
"A bit... better I think..."

[Taichi]
"...seriously, it's because you're not eating properly."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"No appetite, is that it?"

[Touko]
"...never in Summer."

[Taichi]
"But an attack of anemia is bad, Sensei!"
[Taichi]
"What have you eaten today?"

[Touko]
"......"

She didn't eat anything...?

[Taichi]
"Here, sand and witch."

[Touko]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Sandwich."
[Taichi]
"According to the legends, it was eaten sandwiched between sand and a witch, and that is the origin of its name."

[Touko]
"......"

Touko rubs around her eye sockets.

[Taichi]
"How's the eyes?"

[Touko]
"I can see."

[Taichi]
"Then, here."

Touko's hand went up, slow and steady like the rising of the waterline, and seized it.
//a が was missing in this line. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nicey nicey."

[Touko]
"I'm not some pet..."

Even her straight-man has no strength.

[Taichi]
"This is hand-made, I'll have you know."

Fidgeting she removed the wrap, then took a little nibble.

[Touko]
"...it's all dry."

[Taichi]
"They're this morning's."

[Touko]
"It's too big and hard to eat."

[Taichi]
"It was made for me."

[Touko]
"There's way too much mustard."

[Taichi]
"I really like 'em harsh and spicy."

[Touko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Well, is it bad?"

[Touko]
"......delicious."

[Taichi]
"Well then, eat it slowly."

[Touko]
"Sob."

She was sniffling.
Mortified, it seems.
Dear me, dear me.

[Touko]
"Ngh."

She clamps down her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Need to vomit?"

Shake of the head.
Deglutition, even if forcefully.

[Touko]
"...I wanna drink something."

[Taichi]
"My canteen."
[Taichi]
"An essential in a fallen world."

I hand it over.

[Touko]
"..."

With excessive hesitation,
she puts it to the mouth,
then raises the canteen's butt to the sky.
Her throat giving protuberance as water passes through. Vigorously.

[Taichi]
"...you're not replenishing your fluids regularly?"

[Touko]
"But there's no running water."

[Taichi]
"Tasaki Store."

[Touko]
"...I went, but,"
[Touko]
"They fell on the way home, and rolled all the way to the bottom of a hill."
[Touko]
"Clumsy-chan I'm gonna call ya."

[Taichi]
"You could've just returned to the store and taken more."

[Touko]
"...but then I would just have to write another memo and then,"
[Touko]
"if people were to see it..."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

Just because of that?
It's only a question of honor?

[Taichi]
"One's life takes precedence!"

[Touko]
"But..."

She became as if to cry.

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, Kirihara-sensei, you are acting too much like the funny man in a comedy duo you are!"

[Touko]
"I am delicate!"

[Taichi]
"If there's no people anymore, then the recognition of values like that disappears."

Nothing is permitted anymore either.
All that is demanded now,
is the strength to live.
That is a person existing in pure Individuality.
All desires are being usurped by the previously scorned wants.
I didn't think those wants were in Touko.
No.
They are something that I discovered, long ago.
Touko's violent weakness,
I had understood.
This gal's already at the limit.
Mankind fallen, her family also gone, and in that enormous castle-like mansion...
...her, alone.
//This didn't need the dashes... -GHS

[Taichi]
"...from now on, we're going to have to make do and live with only eight of us."

[Touko]
"............"

The silence is heavy.

[Touko]
"Everybody'll just die."

[Taichi]
"Die we will."

Death is an inescapable eventuality for everyone.

[Taichi]
"The problem is when one dies, and how."

[Touko]
"This... can't be can it... people are just... not there anymore."

[Taichi]
"But it's reality."

I thrust it before her.

[Taichi]
"This world has painted out all people. We alone are... reciprocal."

[Touko]
"This is unbearable for me..."

[Taichi]
"Hummm."

This flow, it's...
There's... no other way, perhaps.
There was involvement. A wish for it.
The relationship I wanted to build with Touko was never to be in any way similar to honey, but...
...the choice to abandon this broken girl to herself will never appear.
Up to partway through it's fine.
But... what about the very final part?
What to do?
What will I even do?
There are no more places to escape to, no mistake.
Even if I ride this flow that ought be called the Touko Route, even if I go all the way to the edge, even if nothing is there but Downfall...
This time, not going together to that demise will be impossible.
While being hailed torment by the agony that is this over-ripeness.

[Taichi]
"If whatever you do it remains unbearable..."

[Touko]
"Eh...?"

Touko's response is sensible.
I clam up.

[Taichi]
"...whatever I do, what?"
[Taichi]
"No, well, it's fine if you eat it all."

I stand up.

[Taichi]
"Say,"

[Touko]
"...mwht?"

Touko was still nibbling on her sandwich.

[Taichi]
"What do you think annihilated humanity?"

I look outside the window.
It wasn't a question I expected an answer for.

[Touko]
"This isn't annihilation, no."

An unexpectedly philosophical answer returns.

[Touko]
"...they've just thinned out until they were gone."
