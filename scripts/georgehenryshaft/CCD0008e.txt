The door does not open.
Pushing into it with strength, turbulence was created in front of my eyes.
In the path of the wind.
Buzzing in my ears.
//Hi, cicadas. -GHS
And then, Senpai.

[Taichi]
"Good morning."

[Misato]
"Dear me, good morning."
//Girly. Wait, is that normal with girls...? If they existed, that'd be easy to tell, but alas. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How is the antenna doing?"

[Misato]
"It is coming along little by little, I could say."

[Taichi]
"And, the scheduled completion date is next Sunday, right."

[Misato]
"...you remembered that so well!"
//...why is she shocked he remembered something she told him not twelve hours ago? -GHS

[Taichi]
"In a sense I do."
//The implication is that he read it in the diaries, this may be a minor plot hole. I sometimes wonder if Tanaka's always *intentionally* forgetting that the previous day was That Sunday. -GHS

[Misato]
"Right then. If nothing goes wrong, because us being here..."
//"It's dangerous because we could jump" + "it's forbidden", see below (and the multiple times Misato jumps). -GHS
[Misato]
"But because of that human death, there is nothing that could be done... ah, apologies!"
//The problem here is whether this line refers to the passing of mankind, or the death of Yutaka which is what made the rooftop off-limits and therefore made the antenna fall into disrepair. She's usually not one to break facade, see CCB0005. This strongly suggests the latter. This not only completely contradicts her behavior in e.g. CCA0006, but also continues to imply that there's been no end of mankind at all. Putting it as more than a bit ambiguous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'Tis nooothing."

There's really no need for her to apologize,
//Her route title: Apologizing. -GHS
because I don't hurt in the slightest, I don't.

[Taichi]
"Well, because of 'that' coming to the rooftop had become forbidden."
//This is explicitly about Yutaka now. Though admittedly since it's Misato that can just be her adherence to rules talking, so the actual disappearance of mankind remains more than a little ambiguous still. -GHS

[Misato]
"...but all of you people seem to just show up like you please."
//Interesting considering early Miki route. -GHS

[Taichi]
"If you have to put it like that, what about you right now, Senpai."

The faces of us both meet and exchange glances. And simultaneously, our cheeks relax.

[Misato]
"Then we will both be suspended. Yellow suspension."
//See CCC0041. Did he touch her boobs again...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awww, that's so strict."
[Taichi]
"...this thing, have you gotten it this far alone, Senpai?"

[Misato]
"There were blueprints, so yes, somehow."
[Misato]
"But it was so much trouble. Because it had been all broken up at one time."
//The term can mean it's been abandoned for a year until yesterday, of course... and be equally perfectly apt even if it had just been Tomoki that had torn it apart the day before. Stuff burned and destroyed can easily be replaced: the club has definitely money, and there's shops everywhere that are open if mankind isn't gone at all. In fact, she'd have spares hidden off somewhere if Tomoki keeps doing it, she's just that kind of person. Since she started Sunday evening, and likely been there overnight, even if Taichi goes there at around 9-10AM (the earliest he can be here on Mondays), she still had enough time to clear away the rubble and straighten it up enough to make it look like it is now. In fact, that'd explain why so little work seems to be done on Monday morning despite all that. -GHS

And despite this, Senpai did not seek the help of anyone else.
She exposed herself to the merciless sunlight, alone, and continued her club activities.
//Well, he might make horrendous puns, but fortunately there's been little 仮借 so far. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...even if I said wanted to help after all, that would be simply selfishness talking, would it."

Senpai collapses into a big smile.
//It sort of reminds how she kills yawns in her mouth. -GHS

[Misato]
"Thank you so much."
[Misato]
"Your best wishes alone are enough!"
//See CCA0006 -GHS

Well, that's what it'll be then.

[Taichi]
"Regardless, I would have been glad to be of use to you, anywhere and at any time."

Make use of me in your escape.
//If they're not gonna play his 98 game, he's gonna play theirs. -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, all good I am all good, I will be alright."
//Rejection -GHS
[Misato]
"Instead of that, however, I would much rather for us to have a quiet tea break together next time."
//She totally means something else with that "going for drinks", but... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes!"
