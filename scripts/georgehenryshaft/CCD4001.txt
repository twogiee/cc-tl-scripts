Passing through, I turn towards the direction of the apartment complex that Miki lives in.
//Not 100% on why this route is called the way it is. It possibly refers to the ending lyrics: someday, Miki too will reach out from the mess she is now. Makes more sense given her fight with Kiri in CCE0001. -GHS
Miki comes, running at a half-trot from the foot of the hill.
She sees me.
she breaks into a run,
towards where I am,
despite a stumble.

[Miki]
"BWAAA〜〜〜〜〜〜HAAA!!!"

Crying.
She flew into my chest.
I catch her.

[Miki]
"Senpai, SenpaiSenpaiSenpaaaaaai!!!"
[Miki]
"There's no ooo~ne! It's weee~~ird, this is totally weee~ird!!!"

[Taichi]
"...y-, yes."

[Miki]
"There is no one inside anyone's house! There's really no one, they're all gone, all!!!"

[Taichi]
"That's right. That's so troubling."
//See CCD0006 for comparison. -GHS

I soothe her by patting her back.

[Miki]
"What's even this... this, this just can't be..."

What a tiny little gal.
For Miki to grow up to be indomitable, how much happiness and coincidences and time would be required?
//To grow up indomitable, but that'd require to be Unreset, and that didn't actually work. He intends it in a 'correct', non-exploitative sense of this, whether he gets it or not. And once more, he knows she's been Unreset. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm still with you, you know."

[Miki]
"...sob, sob, yes... so happy... that you're here..."
[Miki]
"I woke up this morning, and mother wasn't there, and there wasn't to eat... and that's why I started thinking, what if everybody else is gone too, and..."

[Taichi]
"And you got frightened?"

Bob bob, a steady nod that rubs her forehead on me.

[Miki]
"I don't like it, not this... I don't like it..."

[Taichi]
"Indeed it's lonely when people aren't there."

[Miki]
"...wanna go home..."

[Taichi]
"You wanna go home then."

[Miki]
"Wanna go home, I wanna go home..."

[Taichi]
"Right, so you want to go home."

[Miki]
"I wanna see Kiri-chin... and all the others too..."
//Hint that she already knows she's gone. -GHS

I give her a handkerchief.
An instant later, she has left her stain on it.
The spilled tears of a girl grow round in their tensile strength, becoming as pearls.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin you say..."

One week.
Sunday is everything.
//HACK doll already there -GHS

[Miki]
"Sob... sob... sob..."

She did nothing but continue to cry all along.
We had joined hands and had come to school.

[Taichi]
"Say now, I sort of have something I gotta take care of so... what are you going to do, Miki?"

[Miki]
"I will wait for Kiri here."
//She's the more codependent of the two after all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...right."
[Taichi]
"Well, see ya."

[Miki]
"Ah, after you have finished with that thing, do you still have other things to do?"

So she says swinging her arms around.

[Taichi]
"Nope."

[Miki]
"Then... I will be waiting here... right here..."
//She knows Kiri won't come. Or at least, that she won't be playing this game with her anymore. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How come you're not waiting in the classroom?"

[Miki]
"...I don't want to go inside a building where there's no people... I feel I won't be able to breathe."
//Some change from "Imma stomp on people's lives for my preservation!". Of course, there's no one... metaphorically speaking. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Gotcha. Well, if I can get this over with quick..."

[Miki]
"Ah, the handkerchief... I will reimburse you, but not with money."
//See CCA0013. Very interesting this one. Was the Yusa thing written on some diary? She won't use money 'cause she's poor. -GHS

With what then?
My Sexual Harassment Soul unconsciously boils to the surface.

[Taichi]
"It's fine. Leaving a girl crying is not worth a handkerchief."

[Miki]
"...sob..."

Presentaneous.
//"Immediate effect". Waw, teh verbiagism's. -GHS
In the classroom.
Kiri was not among us.
No longer... among us.
I can repeat this however many times, but Kiri shall not materialize, not for eternity.
But even if I were to make the word 'eternity' itself into contradiction, there are no means for me to connect with Kiri.
//Sounds more odd than pretentious as far as ways to put it. Of course forever isn't literally forever, but... -GHS
The just retribution for me, who exploited these girls to make provisions for his heart.
Retribution. Punishment. Penalty.
Cross mark. Cross. X.
Kurosu.
//See CCD1001, though technically readers could get here without seeing that. Expanded and adapted: Kurosu<->Cross<->X is more important for the English reader to remember. -GHS
Yet crossing is impossible, now---

[Taichi]
"But... how do I explain this?"

To Miki.
My head aches.
//Euphemism of the year *shudder* -GHS
I return to the main gate.
Miki is squatting, head peeking over the knees.

[Taichi]
"...here I am, Miki!"

[Miki]
"......Senpai, Kiri didn't come."

[Taichi]
"Well maybe she's just taking the day off or something."
//Taichi's lies never ever get good. That's another hint of how poorly he's lying to himself and, by extraction, to the reader. -GHS

[Miki]
"Then she would be... home?"

[Taichi]
"Well, don't know, she might just have gone out or something."
//HACK later change -GHS

[Miki]
"...I'm going."

CSQ 0 1 1
 - Invite her to a date
 - Go with her to Kiri's house
