I was the first to call out to Miki, I think.
//Thursday September 10, 1998 (tagged for consistency as CCC0042 is a shared script). Boy this script is a mess. Short version: no doll work has been made on this, none whatsoever. It also has one of the most horrible typos in the whole of the VN, which gave me quite the headache in the past. And Tanaka seems to be well aware of it. -GHS
//I don't know what the hell they've done to this BG in the 360 version, it looks like they cranked up the orange and the Miki sepia doll looks completely out of place. Maybe they thought it didn't contrast enough? ...on the big screen? No idea. -GHS
Having been thrown out from her original school, she was a lovely lamb that had been brought into the blue folds of Gunjou.
//Look at this scene and realize how people with high Conformity Coefficient can't conform to Gunjou. Truly, the designers of this place are GENIUSES. -GHS
The first day,
she did not have anything to eat at lunch... it seemed.
Through an Information Get from Miyuki, who had become her classmate, I immediately set out to search for her,
//Miki and Miyuki are both 3rd years mid-school, Taichi is 1st year high. Sooo... why does he seek Miki out? The answer seems to be in the first sentence: because she was isolated from the rest. It's not because she's asocial, although, like Touko and Kiri, she seems to be refusing (or at least be incapable) of adapting to her situation. As should be expected by people with abnormal CC. -GHS
to set up a Meeting Event dressed up as coincidence.
//So how's your VN Lingo Bingo coming along? -GHS
In front of the main gate, shut to avoid causing trouble for the neighborhood,
//Wasn't it to prevent running away? Of course, there's no contradiction... technically. -GHS
there Miki was standing, as if stuck.

[Taichi]
"Hii-y!"
//seems some horrible mix between 'hai' and 'hi' -GHS

[Miki]
"...eh?'

[Taichi]
"A girl, and cute. What are you doing? You look troubled. Are you?"

Hoooh, haaah.
//Darth Vader sounds. In fact, given the whole chuuni/disciple/thing and all, this might just be the exact intended effect. Term googles to gas mask AND Darth Vader pics, so it may actually be the official SFX (somehow). -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, uhm... no..."

[Taichi]
"What's it? If there's something you don't get, you can ask anything to the Thesaurus of Gunjou, as Kurosu-kun here is called. I'll teach you all sorts of synonyms. The meanings, though, those I got no clue about."
//If someone wondered whether the purple prose was intended to ridicule people who like to throw big words everywhere, but don't know what the hell they're reading... -GHS

Hoooh, haaah.

[Miki]
"Uhm... well just one."

[Taichi]
"Okieh."

[Miki]
"Why are you wearing a gas mask?"
//See CCA0015B. Yeah, that was a spoiler. Art department gets a big fat boo. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's fashionable!"
//"Join me, and we shall rule the galaxy as Pedo and Loli!" -GHS

For some reason I don't want to show my true face.
//Multiple meanings. -GHS
Some kind of ugliness complex, it seems.
//Is his Body Dismorphic Disorder yet to be diagnosed? More interesting is that this continues to prove the idea that Taichi's monsterhood is entirely imaginary: the gas mask he's wearing is making him look way scarier than he really is. Interesting how Miki's curious, but unafraid: she's likely attracted by his chuuni already. -GHS

[Miki]
"Your hair's white, is it."

[Taichi]
"It's dyed!"

Hoooh, haaah.

[Taichi]
"More importantly, isn't there something that really worries you now?"

[Miki]
"The gate is closed... so I can't go buy anything to eat for lunch."

[Taichi]
"Hum! And in your previous school?"

[Miki]
"We had the School Meal system."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_meal Provided in 99% of the schools in Japan. But not Gunjou...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"You are pitiable, my overnight success of a Cinderella Girl, however this gate here will not open."
//It's all cybersquatted by IdolMaster (sorry, t3H 1d0l/\/\@st3r) now, so whatever was the origin of that idiom I can't find. Seems to be a mix between Cinderella (she's poor, and Taichi guesses) and the idiom itself, meaning she got (in)famous by being sent to Gunjou all of a sudden. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Students cannot go outside during school hours."

[Miki]
"Eh... but... when I went to the cafeteria, everything was sold out!"
//I suppose that Miki isn't so poor she can't afford the cafeteria. However, their family seems to have no money/time for OBENTO-DESUUUUUUUU*crk* which leads back to her not having RAISUUUUU*crk* for breakfast and the Tasaki raids. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Everybody here has strong instincts, that's why. First come, first served."
//Since prowling the corridors doesn't seem to be odd even in allegedly non-suspect times (CCA0007 should be a few weeks after this), prolly most of the good stuff is sold out by lunch. Gunjou is awesome. -GHS

[Miki]
"...so it is... thanks."
//WHY DO YOU HAVE THE CORRECT DOLL DISABLE COMMAND HERE WHEN YOU NEVER IMPLEMENTED DOLLS IN THE FIRST PLACE AGGGGRHGRHASDF -GHS

She goes back towards the school building.

[Taichi]
"Oh, but gladden me with waiting!"

Hoooh, haaah.

[Taichi]
"I have some delicious bread here, even if its best-before date is suspicious, how about it? Won't you eat with me?"
//See CCC0009. Interesting with all the talk about bread not spoiling he'd use this as lure. -GHS

Miki's face showed less annoyance and more bewilderment.

[Miki]
"...no, that is a bit much."

[Taichi]
"No need to hold back. Just let me treat you."

[Miki]
"I cannot be treated by people I just met for the first time... uhm, seriously I'm fine... thanks."
//Don't take candies from strangers? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come on, come on, afternoon's a pain without lunch."

[Miki]
"My apologies."

Definite rejection.

[Taichi]
"...okieh. Then I'll do this. I will give you something to eat in exchange for something from you!"
//See CCC0031B, CCC3007. Wondering if that last girl was always Miki, as Taichi deludes himself of this weird world, still sitting in his classroom... -GHS

[Miki]
"......"

The face I'm looked at with screams, "I'm thinking about how to get away from this".
Resigning herself, she said,

[Miki]
"Something in exchange?"
//Exchange seems to still work, if not foundation. Interesting she's about to do a food transaction with Taichi when she'll later be stealing from Tasaki, especially considering she cheats him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes. Your panties."

She leaves.

[Taichi]
"Kidding, kidding!"

[Miki]
"Uhm... could you be perhaps... toying with me?"
//See CCA0013: he made her too much of a mimidoshima. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I do want to play."

[Miki]
"I feel like you just want to ridicule me..."

[Taichi]
"It's all right. After all, I'm also ridiculous."

Hoooh, haaah.

[Miki]
"...I don't really feel like giving panties around."
//The PS2 version keeps this line intact, but censors the request above. Spot-on job, as usual. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then what would you like to give me?"

[Miki]
"I can give you anything, really?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

Pupils shine with defiance.

[Miki]
"Say I wanted to concede you to become my gopher for life."
//Twisting the words straight off the gate. -GHS

[Taichi]
"A love slave? I would love that!"

She's startled.

[Miki]
"Indeed I can do without for now. Instead, I'll give you the order to get on all fours, then, like a dog... KYAH?!"
//This form will return in CCC4022, keeping it a bit unique-ish. See CCC0026 for the replay. -GHS

Dogness was already attained at the exact moment in time she said "like a dog".

[Taichi]
"Woof!"

[Miki]
"...wa-, this I can also do without! Uhm, uhmmm..."

Seems like she felt that tossing me an unreasonable request would drive me away.
//See CCD1001: same as Taichi will try to Misato. -GHS
She doesn't get it.
This level of things just delights me.
//He's in search of punishment, as well. Who was it that got hooked and participated with zeal back at the Mansion...? -GHS
Confidence returns on Miki's face.

[Miki]
"Then, please try and take off that gas mask."

[Taichi]
"This? ...hummm."

That's troubling.
The first impression of me is... fairly eerie, that's why.
//That above was his first impression of himself. Indeed, that's true. -GHS
But, nothing I can do.
I remove the mask.

[Taichi]
"...here."

[Miki]
"............"

[Taichi]
"Air's nice without a filter."

[Miki]
"That bleached-white hair is your real hair, isn't it."

[Taichi]
"Indeed!"

[Miki]
"Those eyes... are you wearing contacts?"

[Taichi]
"I got a physical defect, so my iris is a little different from that of normal people."
[Taichi]
"...you know that it shines at the right angle?"

[Miki]
"Uhm..."

She's a little bit scared.
Eyes hold the emotions.
Being different from people's means they look eerie.
//Still wishing the artwork would actually show this. "People" meant, given it's him, specifically as non-human and not just as in 'other people'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...that's probably spooky. Sorry!"

[Miki]
"No, not really..."

[Taichi]
"Because of these, I have had to see so many heart-rending hardships in my life."
//目に遭って be met with hardships, but literally reads "meet with my eyes" -GHS

The atmosphere quietens.
//(pondering if to use Latin) (pondering if to use pig latin) (mmmh, pork) (DINNER.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"But if I eat lunch with a beautiful girl, this wound will be healed for su-ure."
//See Kiri, especially CCC0027. Damn he uses those lines around... -GHS

And while saying this, I squat to peek through to under her miniskirt.

[Miki]
"KyAAH?!"

[Taichi]
"Tsk. Good reflexes."
//Hinting that her having gotten better in the first week isn't entirely impossible. -GHS

[Miki]
"Wh-, what-, what are you... really..."

[Taichi]
"I, who am called the Gunjou Institute Japanese-to-English Dictionary, am a man of pedantries."
//See CCA0015C. Now he's a J2E dictionary, and he doesn't know English anyway. On the topic, I strongly support meaning 3 of pedantic in the case of the kind of pretentious bull that's being spoofed here. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The only fly in this ointment is being sort of sexually perverted."

[Miki]
"......"

And soon,

[Miki]
"Pft."

A tiny laugh.

[Miki]
"...weirdo."

[Taichi]
"A precise assessment. So, what will it be? Panties or lunch?"

[Miki]
"In other words... I'm being picked up, is that what you are saying?"
//No, Miki, this isn't Nanpa; it's Denpa. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeppy yep."

[Miki]
"First time I've been, you know."

[Taichi]
"You do look like it is... it could be said that you've been within my striking range from the age of five."
//This sounds more pedophilic than it probably is... maybe. See CCA0020 and CCA0006. It's not actually clear whether it was HIS being five or hers, given his early days with Nanaka. -GHS

[Miki]
"So you're a pervert then."

[Taichi]
"Very much so."
[Taichi]
"So, what'll it be, some lunch?"

[Miki]
"...well, please climb over that gate and buy enough food for one more person at that delicious Bread shop, please. I will then concede eating together with you."
//Tasaki store, see CCA0030 -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's great."

I scrambled over the gate.
//This is why the gate is "always open". To him, it is. -GHS
It's several meters tall.
All at once the guards come out in an uproar,
//IOW, they were barely looking at Mr. 84% Clambersovergates when he approached a girl near the gate in a gas mask. There's absolutely nothing that Taichi can't get away with. -GHS
but I'm faster in going beyond the gate. And land.

[Miki]
"YH?!"

To Tasaki Groceries,
//This is what the sign above the store in the BG says. -GHS
also called the Tasaki Store.
Well, there's lots of stuff there, ain't it.
//It's all but a Kombini, I guess, otherwise the joke in CCD2002 doesn't make sense. -GHS
And at this Tasaki Groceries I buy bread and drinks,
//On credit, of course, so he just sticks up a note. Tasaki is straight bee-line from Gunjou, so that the guards wouldn't catch him is borderline absurd. -GHS
and come back.
There's a number of guards in the suburbs, patrolling in circles, looking for me.
//And NOT ONE IS GUARDING THE GATE. -GHS
I cut through, and cross the gate once more.
The guards, with their inferior mobility, will need to open the gate.
//So all or at least most of the guards are outside? This is complete incompetence! -GHS
Keeping them in the corner of my eyes, I search for Miki.
//Note he never seems to pay for this, or even be caught. It's very possible the guards ignored him as he's harmless. It's possible that in the coming years, his comings and goings become so routine that they don't even bother running after him. Just like Combat the dog. -GHS
...she's not here.
Back to her classroom maybe?
Dash to the First Years' classroom.
//This is a pretty damn horrible typo, as Miki and Kiri are third years middle school and Taichi was first year. Of course, Tanaka could've just corrected it, but instead... -GHS

[Taichi]
"How 'bout it, I bought you this!"
[Taichi]
"Wait, *I* was still a first year!"
//YEAH! SCREW YOU FOURTH WALL! -GHS

Disappointment & shock...
In a panic I move to the Middle Grade section.
And, in the Third Year Middle Grade classroom...

[Taichi]
"How 'bout it, I bought you this!"

[Kiri]
"Mine is also tasty!"
//By now we've transcended Sono Hanabira levels of lesbianism into Vividred Operation. One more push and the dreaded post-apocalyptic no-more-men world of K-On!, with its obvious clones, like c'mon Azusa and Mio are obviously 99.99% genetically identical, like their teacher and that girl from the Jazz Club, by the way my theory is that said club was behind the whole apocalypse and, uhm, what were we talking about? Ah, yes, about girls liking their Nintendo Ui so much they might as well have married them. -GHS

[Miki]
"...thaaanks!"

[Taichi]
"D'AAAAAAAAH!!!"
//Not a Rabbids reference, oddly. -GHS

She was eating.

[Miki]
"Ah... it's that Pervert-san from before."
//Let's go with nickname. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...mngh, that pervert from the other day."
//Sooo what brought Kiri to be so close to Miki? Outside of jelly for Taichi, of course. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hey now!"

[Miki]
"I didn't really think you would seriously buy something for me..."

[Taichi]
"My motto is Serious in Jest."
//And if you don't get that... -GHS

Kiri guards Miki's rear.
//Seems more metaphorical than literal... since they're sitting and everything. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Will you be flipping skirts again, Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"Mngh... that kicking girl from the other day... but I'm just handing over some lunch to this girl."
//Seems they haven't had their formal introduction yet. Interesting that Miki never came up in CCC3004, but let's just go with "it wasn't written yet". -GHS

[Kiri]
"That is now unnecessary."

[Taichi]
"Whaaat?"

[Kiri]
"I will be watching out for her and well. There is nothing here of concern to you, Senpai."

Ngh, waving Justice around and then using nothing but force... you're just like America!
//Curiously, this is censored in both versions... and I wonder if it's not because, these days, Japan would be looking more at China than America for this stuff. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, now my tummy's all full!"
//As for the actual scene: see CCC3019A, which is the near-perfect reverse of this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"EHHHHH?!"

[Miki]
"...apologies."

[Kiri]
"It's OK, there's no need to apologize to this guy."

[Miki]
"Ehhh, but..."
//She already, at this point, dislikes the two of them fighting. -GHS

[Kiri]
"He's this school's number one ruffian, that's why."
//KIRI SAKURA REGRETTED THE LAST SCHOOL BECAUSE BIG BROTHER YUTAKA WAS BULLIED DUE TO NATIONAL TESTS. IN DESPERATION, KIRI PROVOKED A RUFFIAN. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...come on, come on. You're pigeonholing me too much!"

I'm not really particularly rotten.
//"warumono" is scoundrel/bad guy, but "waru" alone (here in katakana, so no hints) can mean bad... or broken/split, too. -GHS
There's lots of stuff I could do but I don't, and I try to appear cool and not being hard to approach!
And being in truth fairly popular with the girls, although the person in question (me) doesn't know that...
...and being still in truth a Bishonen even if I give the impression of a mediocre person that can't be talked to because he's so terrified of what's around him, and being very kewl, and the only girl who's OK with talking to me would be my childhood friend...
//He wants to be Sephiroth more than Cloud, doesn't he? With the Darth Vader sounds above, heh. The fright received from his surroundings and the childhood friend are sorta true. -GHS
...and having memory loss, and having no father, 'cause conversely you'd foil the Settei by having a living father with great personality, no good!
//...and so are the memory loss and lack of father. Well, at this late in the game these aren't that important, really, but they do highlight how much he's chuunin' already back here. -GHS
I'm always at full strength.

[Taichi]
"......"

Being cool should make me popular though.
...I fail.
//Too many crap piled on his Settei, idiot! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Welll what do I do with this bread?'

[Miki]
"...should we just buy it?"

[Kiri]
"Bwah, disgusting!"

[Taichi]
"Ngh... even though I was the first to call out to her."
[Taichi]
"If it has to be like this, I shall eat here by force!"

I sat glued close to the two.

[Kiri]
"Wh-, what do you think you are doing?!"

[Miki]
"Kyah, really!"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh delicious, delicious. They say meat on the verge of spoiling is tasty, but bread on the verge of spoiling also has a quaint and unorthodox taste, don't it!"
//Is this the bread that was before, the one with the suspicious expiry date? ...did he even go beyond the gate at all? And if he likes bread on the verge of spoiling, then all that bread that should've spoiled... also, might be more pans, uhm, puns, but should be http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q109946230 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Please don't be here!"
//Polite rudness for major tsundere. -GHS

[Miki]
"Kyah, really, ahahah... what a problem."

Strained laughter,
but it doesn't look like she dislikes it that much.

[Taichi]
"Tasty tastyyy, ah, that side dish looks delicious!"

[Kiri]
"Hands oooff! That is my boxed lunch!"
//TL Note: 『boxed lunch』はお弁当の意味 -GHS

[Taichi]
"What's thaaat!"

Begin quarreling.

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah... what indeeed!"

While we fought with words, Miki looked on with a complicated expression on her face.
//Ohhh, very interesting. See CCA0015: she was making imitative behavior of Misato in CCA0027... but quarreling seems to make her displeased in the same way as Misato in that scene, even if her behavior in CCA0015 was imitative. Now see CCA0020. -GHS
