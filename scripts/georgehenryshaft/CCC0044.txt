The place where the antenna is.
//HACK zoom -GHS
Mimi-senpai isn't here.
It's likely because of those injuries.
Her club activities had been forcibly interrupted.
At the base of the antenna, machine parts and tools and the like lie scattered about.
There's a notebook.
I try looking at it.

[Taichi]
"............"

I see.
She was getting things done while going through all kinds of hardships.
//As is typical here. -GHS
An SOS...
An SOS sent via the antenna. That fits right on the mark.
//The SOS is also hers, if it's yet not clear for some reason -GHS
A wonderful plan this, so like Mimi-senpai.
For Mimi-senpai alone however... it seems likely the amount of work would never end.
Red lines have been drawn on parts of the diagrams.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
『But I cannot reach this〜! (sob)』
//HACK back to normal -GHS
Hahaha! That's for sure.
//gurlz r short. Also see CCA0025C. SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
Well, what can you do.
I erect the stepladder, and climb above.
//... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Over here... is it like this?"

And I was finished.

[Taichi]
"This should be right."
[Taichi]
"Then, next up is..."

I look down at the blueprint.
//HACK dim screen -GHS
『Don't understand this part (sob)』
『Leaving for later (sob)』
『This is wrong (sob)』
『??? (sob)』
『Made a mistake maybe... verify later (sob)』
『A wire snapped, and I cannot look for something that could work as replacement (sob)』
『(sob)』
『(sob)』
『(sob)』
//HACK back to normal -GHS
Ain't this full of whining now.
//You need others' help you're so troublesome. More seriously, crying + complaints -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Mimi-senpai..."

I try looking at the antenna.
A Broadcast Station... then.
//HACK to sky -GHS
Whatever the result of the SOS,
the idea of broadcasting with everyone together was a strange encouragement for my heart.
Because it is excessively wholesome.
Wholesomeness harps on the heartstrings of us who exist on the opposite side from it.
//どうしてそんな琴！ -GHS
And with this,
I began Club Activities.
//HIS club is still interaction calisthenics. AKA chatting, which is why the Broadcast Club is so damn important regardless of what they do, because conversation practice is something these guys have little of. -GHS
