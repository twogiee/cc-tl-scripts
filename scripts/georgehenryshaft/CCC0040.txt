Tomoki was there.
He's peeping covertly into the infirmary.

[Taichi]
"Tomokiii."

I call out to him and his back sprung up with a start.

[Tomoki]
"Ta-, it's Taichi...?"

[Taichi]
"You were at school then."

[Tomoki]
"Ahhh, I came to see at how things are things a bit... c'mere a bit."
//It sort of sounds like he wants to tell him something, but he's just leading him away from the infirmary so their talking won't wake her up. Siscon. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh?"

I go with him.

[Tomoki]
"Should be fine here I guess."

[Taichi]
"Why here in this corner?"

[TomokI]
"...well."

He hesitates to say.

[Taichi]
"So, how's the Peace-Keeping Club going?"
//See CCC0019 -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Life Maintenance and Improvement Club! That's going somehow."
[Tomoki]
"Taichi, you been alright as far as food and that stuff, right?"

[Taichi]
"Eh, well. Got no worries in the immediate."
[Taichi]
"I should be fine if I can get through the one week."
//Slightly specified. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Just talking to myself, reallyyy!"
//Tsundere -GHS
[Taichi]
"Got something to do in the infirmary?"

Tomoki's face twitched.

[Tomoki]
"NO-, NOO (No)."
//TL Note: "no" means "no". See CCC0041 for why it's a must. As usual, I wish I could use kana and furmintmentgana... -GHS

What's up with the English.
//This is funnier in Engl--- oh. Has a Kansai -nen. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then what I saw is a secret."
//WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT DEMONIC RAPTURE KEICHI -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You saw nothing."

[Taichi]
"...infirmary, Tomoki, afterschool, virginity... and the conclusion that these four keywords lead to is..."

It was time for inference.

[Taichi]
"No, virginity's unrelated."
[Taichi]
"A difficult question this. When things are like that, it's time for Meta-Inference."

[Tomoki]
"You're blurting out weird stuff again."

[Taichi]
"Many Worlds Belabored Inference!"
//It just means he's gonna ramble, really. Love that he's just tossing out MWI long before it should be applicable. Not that it matters since it's no less troll here than elsewhere. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That is, arranging parallel all the myriad possibilities derived from each element, elucubrating on them, then extracting arbitrarily from the midst of those limitless alternatives the one most likely... a principle of inference in the style of a quantum computer!"
//Can't believe that fit. I'd complain, but that's pretty much how I figured out the 0.108 ratio for the time loop. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Can't you just call that guesswork now."
//Well, yes, but coincidence is also a good choice. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And for that purpose, an amount of sugar for thought revitalization is required. The odd candy, please."
//Along with I, candy in Japanese is weird; but in this case, it's pretty much adverbially so. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"GIB MII GUM, GIB MII CHOCOLEETO."
//i should transl- trey- tra-nscri-be tehn and furigana teh englis bt the nays guys at the hospital said i had to dial back teh weird so tis shldbe nderstandable? If not, I think it's a reference to this: http://www.peterpayne.net/2013/07/japanese-people-i-have-met.html -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...but you always carry candy around, Taichi..."
//The pedo. See CCA0030, CCC0029A, too many to count really. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That is for emergency cases of dropping blood sugar level only."

[Tomoki]
"You got diabetes or something?"
//That's a good question, actually. That'd possibly be what makes him blind. -GHS

Tomoki fishes in his pocket, rustling.
At present, if it's about food then it's about Tomoki.
>                                                     Tomoki ga, kuimono nano de aru!
No... by now... Tomoki...  Tomoki is food!
//I know what you're thinking, but I have a good explanation for this: Japan. -GHS
...dumm'ass I am.
//BTW, the joke is gone from at least the Reprint and PS2 edition. And since the 360 engine is anti-furries(tm) and prints the English right *next* to the Japanese text, the joke bombs flat right then and there. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Here."

He seriously produced some chewing gum and chocolate.

[Taichi]
"You're an amazing fella ain'tcha."
//Tomoki is an American soldier, and that's why Taichi keeps saying his club is the Peacekeeping Corps -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Eh... what? Really, you said yourself you wanted them didn't you."

[Taichi]
"With these, my peculiar brain matter is also at peace."

[Tomoki]
"???"

Chewing Gum and chocolate:
they are both simultaneously tossed into the mouth.

[Tomoki]
"Ughyack!"
//You can say that again. *chomps on popcorn and chocolate cookies alternatively* -GHS

[Taichi]
"Their simultaneous flavor is delicious."

[Tomoki]
"Right..."

Disgusted.

[Taichi]
"But the inference continues nonetheless."
[Taichi]
"Are there injuries anywhere?"

Tomoki is somewhat surprised.
It is immediately replaced by a face that feels sarcastic.

[Tomoki]
"Yeah... injury, there's that."
//Of course it's referring to Misato... or is it? She got injured in her flight; see CCD1001 - Tomoki also got injured by helping her avoid a similar injury. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"...serves 'er right."

[Taichi]
"What?"

[Tomoki]
"...'s nothing. See ya."

He leaves.

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

I swallow the chewing gum together with the chocolate.
I'm a person with the Swallows Chewing Gum Character Attribute.
//creep -GHS

[Taichi]
"...perhaps, rather than injury, I should have called it a disease of the heart."
