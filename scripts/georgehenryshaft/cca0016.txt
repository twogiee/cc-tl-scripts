When I went into the classroom no one was there.
//Wednesday September 9, 1998 -GHS
There was no trace of that Touko and her persistent gloom at her desk.

[Taichi]
"Well then."

I take out the manuscript's paper from my bag.
I'd managed to finish the script overnight.
//How could that not end well... -GHS
I wanna go show this right away, so it can receive the OK.
To the rooftop.

[Misato]
"Peke-kun."

I was welcomed by a distrustful gaze.

[Taichi]
"Oh, President."
[Taichi]
"Why are you guarding your upper chest?"
//With one arm. -GHS

[Misato]
"...well..."

Face went red.

[Misato]
"Uhm, it is about what happened yesterday, I do not remember it well..."

[Taichi]
"Do you now."

[Misato]
"Wh-, what if I, what if I...?"

[Taichi]
"So-, something wrong?"

Suddenly playing the fool.
//Either person. -GHS

[Misato]
"......!"

She hangs her head in shame and, oh no!, grows anguished.
//Term for anguish odd enough it needs ruby text, and it's "ou nou". The furries's'ses' will return, see CCB2002, which is nearly unheard of for furigana, plus there's CCB0006 when "nou" is used literally as 'no'. I'm taking this as totally intentional. -GHS
However, the arm covering the chest does not shake by a single atom.

[Taichi]
"...anyway, let's go over here."

I grab Senpai's wrist and pull.

[Misato]
"KyahWah?!"
//A novel scream of agglutinated kyah and wah. -GHS

Flustered shouts Senpai.

[Misato]
"NOOOOOO!"

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Misato]
"See..."

[Taichi]
"See?"

[Misato]
"See, seethr..."
//すけすけ sukesuke, seethrough -GHS
[Misato]
"Seecaypegowt!"
//Ew... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Scapegoat."
//...e. -GHS

Inside of my head a sheep, just one, diving into a thicket.
//Scapegoat, see the Bible; the sheep diving into the thicket is Taichi, the lost sheep, who entered into the fallen world of Men and is being chased by the Shepherd (Jesus). Or, in short: SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Misato]
"It is scapegoat, that is bad!"
//Makes sense if you replace "seethrough" with it, which is the point of the joke. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I do not like them myself."
//Well, they are more of a Jewish thing; Jesus sorta replaced the lot of 'em. -GHS

[Misato]
"Not paying attention is out of the question!"
//To herself being seethrough, likely -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."
[Taichi]
"But me, I was not trying to make scapegoat of you, Senpai, I just wanted us to move to the shade."
//Because he's daaaaaark and needs to be in the shadoooooows -GHS

[Misato]
"Ah, I see now, well then let us."

She's becoming fraaa-yed.
//This is the typical term used to mean "their ultramarine is showing" -GHS
We move.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, Senpai, yesterday you were drinking alcohol, were you."

[Misato]
"Ah, eh... aaah."
[Misato]
"...apowlogies."
//Foreign again? -GHS

She wilted.

[Taichi]
"That was some trouble!"
[Taichi]
"Could it be that... drunk... I did something really bad?"

Yes! Suckered in!
//See CCD1001. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, that was the kind of shameless playact one should simply never again describe."
//Similar term used to describe the 'download panties' part of the Kiri sex scene in the Recollections. FWIW. -GHS

[Misato]
"!?!?"

Senpai's eyes became an [><] mark in landscape orientation.
//SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS
That is one grand speechlessness.
//Speechlessness is written 'Chinese quatrain', because poetry is impossible and evil and should be abolished and is bad. -GHS

[Misato]
"AwAaAaAaH!"

[Taichi]
"But be at ease! This harmless young boy skillfully dealt with it, it has been cleaned up so that the public eye will never notice!"

[Misato]
"...ahhh, so you did... thank you, very much."

Something she is unsatisfied about still remained, and Senpai hung her head.
//Curiously, same term as CCA0011A. -GHS

[Misato]
"But me, what sort of disgraceful conduct..."

[Taichi]
"Are you asking?"

[Misato]
"..."

Flummoxed.

[Taichi]
"Will you take responsibility, whatever it is?"
//I don't even know if he's being a bastard if he just understands her at a deep level. See CCD1001B: I suspect the latter while thinking he's the former. -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes?"

This time her eyes turn into dots from the shock.

[Taichi]
"Nah, if you're asking, then who knows if you really will..."

[Misato]
"AhwAhwAhwAhw!"

[Taichi]
"Nah, if I think about it calmly, it was not that big of a mess."

[Misato]
"It, isn't?"

[Taichi]
"Are you asking?"

For a considerably long while Senpai mulled over with crossed eyes.

[Misato]
"......yeah."

[Taichi]
"That was really a big mess."
//Mirrors above. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Using some of the wiring of that antenna over yonder, you did a little naked limbo dance photo-shoot facing my direction."
//Could this be any more obvious... well, considering that who's in charge of the wiring, this is also sort of icky. -GHS

[Misato]
"I am finished."

Flop, and she sinks hard to the floor.

[Misato]
"Dear sir, I hope that things have been well since the month with those sweet small clumsy feet..."
//April. Means her father's been in jail for at least five months. More stuff of this kind (Japanese only): http://jikou-aisatu.seesaa.net/ Adapted reference is E.E. Cummings, seems appropriate although it's not exactly a (semi)standard reference, like the original. -GHS

She reads out an Imaginary letter.

[Taichi]
"Senpai, steadfast!"

[Misato]
"...I did not believe that living could worsen any more than this..."
//She's writing a suicide note to her father. It's heartbreaking on second read. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It was disposed of skillfully!"

[Misato]
"And yet... my bra..."

[Taichi]
"Could it perhaps be that you have not returned home yet?"

Senpai wordlessly nods.

[Taichi]
"Then, right now... you are as you woke up?"

Second time, a bob of the head.

[Taichi]
"Then..."

Gulp, I drink down saliva.
Senpai is now.
Under a thiiin transparent-prone shirt.
Nake-- NAKEEED.
UNNNDEeEeEeR the CLOoOoOoOoOoOoTHES NAKEeEeEeEeEeEeEeD!!!
//Progressively dissembled. ッ=x3,x6,x7 7+6+3=16 1+6=7 -GHS
...wait, if I put it that way, then throughout the world there's girlettes naked under their clothes.
//Joshikko? No, no and no, dude when you're making up silly words for 'girl' you need to put nyans in them. -GHS
Well, in other words... she's currently going no-bra.
//See CCC0041. Don't look behind you. -GHS
I see, that's the reason for her acting so weird.
And because Senpai's are biiit large,
the strain on the fabric is a biiit conspicuous.
//Still a little drooly. -GHS
It made my heart go a bit boom-boom.

[Taichi]
"F-, first things first, how about returning home and taking a cold bath?"

[Misato]
"Do I smell?"
//See CCC4003, CCD4003 -GHS
[Misato]
"But I did rinse my body with the water here at school at least..."
//There's a hose likely tapped straight into the water tower nearby (see Miki/Kiri routes), so works regardless. -GHS

Ah, niiice, that 'chewation!
//lit. stew[ation]. Hungry? -GHS
If I were an early riser, I could have that sort of random encounter, likely.
//Player should've picked "go straight to school" instead of "stay in bed some more". That's why he never meets anyone on the road in the morning (provided it IS morning at all). -GHS
Why can't I just be washed on the shore of events like that, I wonder.
That kind of things is just a waste. It's a disqualifier for an Eror!
* "Eror" (spanish pronunciation) = Taichian for an
   heroic being with a strong perverted side.
//See CCC3025. The perverted hero is liked more than a thousand molesters? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Senpai, please leave this to me!"

[Misato]
"?"

I returned to the classroom.
I take a sports towel from my bag.
//Should be the Taichi Bag, see CCB2013. No idea if that has gotten Fixed already, however. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Would you be able to replace it with this?"
//You could just return her b-- sorry, as a man I can't finish that sentence without laughing. -GHS

I present it to her.

[Misato]
"Peke-kuun!"

Senpai is moved and close to tears.

[Taichi]
"It is bleached cotton, right? From the feeling of it, I do not think it will become transparent."

[Misato]
"What a nice boy now..."

She accepted the towel while tears flow freely down the cheek.

[Misato]
"Wait just a little while now. If you move you get a nai-nai!"
//Now addressing Poko-chin the doggy. Original term "meh!" is used to scold small children or animals. Made something just as childish. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yee-es."

Senpai vanished behind cover.
I did feel I wanted to have this 'nai-nai', but I endured.
//See CCD0021. Is this an omen of things to come? -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

What kind of 'nai-nai' is that, even.
Udder cusps squeezed together, and with their two wild strawberries on top they approach the tip of an impertinent flagpole, and as a salute, 'nai-nai'...
//Adapted because Taichi's not sick, but not well either. -GHS

[Taichi]
"AAAAAH, stupidstupidstupid! You are so stupid!"
//4xA + 3xBaka, and then... idiot added one baka too many. -GHS

A few minutes later...

[Misato]
"Wah, Peke-kun, good morning!!!"

She came back with a ridiculously cheerful face.
//Fake... -GHS
And with her chest proudly puffing,

[Misato]
"Today is another Summer day, is it not! That warmth just continues on and on!"

[Taichi]
"Da-, damn if it does."

[Misato]
"Well then, what are you here for on this morning?"

[Taichi]
"I impose to deliver the hand-written script requested of me yesterday."
//Hyperformal. -GHS

[Misato]
"A script? You have written a scenario for use in the maiden broadcast?"

[Taichi]
"Yes ma'am."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, that is amazing! That is beyond recognition!"
//That's way not meant flatteringly, see CCC4019 for more. -GHS

Her face is full of goodwill and admiration.

[Taichi]
"Naaa〜h!"

I twisted around like a bread roll.
//Yup, hungry. -GHS

[Misato]
"May I examine it?"

[Taichi]
"I would be most glad."
//Still formal. -GHS

[Misato]
"Well then."

I hand her the writing paper.
Senpai's very pupils sternly grow in severity.
Her gaze ran light over the script paper.

[Taichi]
"..."

Shortly afterwards,
Senpai's face lifted.
Her entire face is a smile. It was like, to make a comparison... the Virgin Mary.
//Technically a Holy Mother (generic), but given she IS Taichi's third mom, let's continue not to kid anyone here. -GHS
Like an apparition of the Virgin Mary.
Her areolar halo a burden, this is what she said:
//I wonder if that's a pun with nipples. Sorry, I meant, I WONDER IF THAT'S A PUN WITH NIPPLES. THAT WORD ALSO MEANS 'AREOLA' AFTER ALL. I'd leave it just "areolar", but then it's not obvious enough it's intended to also be a halo. -GHS

[Misato]
"Fail."
//Vs. pass, you damn morons. This is what Misato and her highly articulated and suspiciously right-wing insight think of illegible verbiagistic pseudo-nietzscheian eight-grader real-life-chuuni pidgin as fed through the mythological beast theSaurus which then shat on the page. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awoooooooooooooooof!!!!"
//If -=ぅ, then ぅx16 -GHS

Through and over the fence I howled at the town.

[Taichi]
"I will be redoing it..."

[Misato]
"I am expecting it."
//Suuubtle insult. -GHS

Dejected I return to inside the building.

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes, right, absolutely do not wash that towel before you return it, please."

[Misato]
"What?"

And, the very instant that Senpai tilted her neck,
all the materials that had been propped up began slowly to move.
//Uh-oh, the tools have started to move. -GHS

[Taichi]
"OH! DANGEROUS!!"
//Random English. Important, see further down. -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh?"

I can't make it in time!
The stepladder, the antenna radiators, the tools... all of them,
all at once poured down upon Senpai.
All poured down---

[Misato]
"...mh..."

Senpai had woken.

[Taichi]
"I am so glad... you are all right... I was so worried!"

[Misato]
"I have been..."

[Taichi]
"Sob! I'm really so happy that this isn't any worse..."
//He's talking like a boy now. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Nee-san."

[Misato]
"Incorrect."

[Taichi]
"That wounds me."

She returns to the topic and says,

[Misato]
"Please explain the situation."
//Oddly formal. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You have been injured, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"You then received medical services here."
[Taichi]
"And now, you woke. That is all."

[Misato]
"So I was injured, was I?

[Taichi]
"Just a little."

[Misato]
"Uhmmm...?"

Senpai gropes around her body,
//fnarr fnarr -GHS
the gauze rolled over her arm,
the bandages affixed in a spread all over.

[Misato]
"OwChChCh! It hurts all over..."
//Intentional...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"You got light bruises all over, that is why."

[Misato]
"...so careless I am."

[Taichi]
"I am really glad there is nothing worse."

[Misato]
"...thank you, Peke-kun. You called out to me."
//Compare their histories. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'s nuthin'."

[Misato]
"Well then, to club activities now..."

[Taichi]
"Nope and nope, don't you move."

I keep her from rising.

[Misato]
"But why?"

[Taichi]
"Fundamentally it is no big thing, but still..."

I slowly and deliberately move the sheets off, and flip the skirt as well.
//Very much intentional. This is just a 'uh-oh'. -GHS
A femoral region plump and voluptuous got exposed. Plump and voluptuous.
//Uh-oh x2 -GHS

[Misato]
"....................."

[Taichi]
"Look at this plump and voluptuous thigh, it got all pockmarked! So, today you are taking a break from club activities and taking care of yourself..."

[Misato]
"Haaf, haaaf!"

Pak-pak, she makes her mouth open and close.
//IT'S PACMAN VS. SINISTAR BITCHES! ALL! BETS! ARE! OFF!!! See CCA3004 -GHSeriousNoReally

[Taichi]
"Whoa, there's blood seeping all 'round here!"

Blood.
Taichi. "Should I refresh the dressing?"
Two sharp nods.
//She seems frightened and she's not talking anymore. Whatever went wrong, it already went wrong. -GHS
I bring some gauze and go to refresh.

[Taichi]
"Weeell, regardless."
[Taichi]
"Aren't your legs so sexy."

[Misato]
"I will be doing this myself!"
//Slightly angry. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh, no good! Please leave this to me."

[Misato]
"But, but pleeease..."

[Taichi]
"After all,"

I look at the thigh.
//Panties still there. -GHS
Blood is seeping through.
That's a big problem.

[Taichi]
"After all."
//Totally gone. -GHS

This pretty blood,
is leaking out without end.
Red blood.
Red...Red.
Feeling dizzy, I close the eyes.
//Dizzy's written with eye, dazzle. Interesting considering he claims he has eyeshine. -GHS
And open.
//See CCC3012A: same. -GHS
Aaah...
The world is always ever so ambiguous.
//No shit, boyo. -GHS
All these squirming little thingies turn red with just a touch.
//Humans. Or genitals. -GHS
It's simple. It is a simple thing.
All the senses strengthen, so that what is invisible becomes as visible.
//Being able to see what's not there is not a superpower; it's hallucinating. -GHS
The range of visible light changes.
//As it's getting evening, yes. -GHS
Faintly the field of vision hazes, and grows sensitive to all that moves.
//Is he crying...? Or maybe, when he goes "sleepy", his eyes also lose focus. -GHS
Abruptly, I forget who or what I am,
and I feel my awareness being completely replaced.
//See CCC3012A on this. -GHS
Motion.
All sensations throughout the body are ambiguous.
//"bodily sensation" + "skin-body feelings Mythical Being That Can Read Minds". -GHS
A sense of self off from somewhere doesn't understand whether it isn't.
//Oddly ambiguous. I suspect this ties to CCX0001. -GHS
In the center of the field of vision lies a red point.
I try approaching it.
Interference. Noise. White noise.
//Describing this a little because it is VERY specific in Japanese, not so in English. Makes slightly more sense with the edit at the end of CCC3025. This is what he uses to censor the bad stuff; and yet, he's currently in Wrong Mode, isn't he? Even odder at the end of the character vignettes at the end of every Sendback route, where this is his disconnection with the character. -GHS
There's a phenomenon of sort, it seems.
The details I don't understand.
Cannot feel my own body.
It has integrated with the world, and that sole feeling of omnipotence is now everything.
//See CCX0001. -GHS
Noise.
What could this thing even be...
There is something heterogeneous in the world.
A red dot.
Ahhh.
Ahhh, understood!
I have fallen into error.
I have arbitrarily concluded that what I can see is unequivocally the normal everyday.
//Eroge Mode? Regardless, there's no certainty that what is wrong is what he normally sees vs. what he is seeing now. -GHS
In truth, that is not the case.
That contradiction brings a stricture and a change of the field of view.
//He's going back to focusing, maybe. -GHS
The beast, aware its turn has come, stirred with joy.
It's a beast constructed of instincts, abiding by
laws - urges - priorities in contrast with the present age.
//Ah, it's '98 game beginning? -GHS

[Taichi]
"wwwﾍ√ﾚvvwwﾍ√~~"
//I don't think there's enough detail to decrypt this waveform. It's 14 characters total, of which 7 Western letters, so I guess that's it. As for what he is saying, it's unknown and never mentioned. -GHS

I emitted a sound.
Noise.
What is... this?
Apply awareness.
Listen.
Decypher.
Connect.
Define.
I get it.
This is a sound.
A wave homogeneous with the ones that come out of the mouth.
//Oddly, he used a sentence HE said and then it switches to Misato. I strongly suspect this is the point: what Misato's about to say is not what she says, but what he says she says. We may be witnessing the process of construction of the very fake world that we're about to see. -GHS
Consciousness converges. If the sound is understood, translation is also speedy.
//*5 months in* I wish. *10 months in* haaaaahahahahahah deadline's a month away and I'm still finding cross-references. -GHS
**********************
Mi********************
//This is the line that had the kanji for 'beautiful' still in it in the older Week 2 revision. -GHS
Misato*****ke******n?*

[Misato]
"Pe**...***n?"
//...odd that he has the character tag in this as well, isn't it? But the console version doesn't, so I'm taking it as just an engine limitation. -GHS
[Misato]
"Peke...*kun?"
[Misato]
"Peke... kun?"
//Is she just repeating this over and over? Maybe. This is #6, of which the first three unvoiced. Something is very obviously off. -GHS

Ahhh, I get it.
Miya - palace
Sumi - clarity
Mi   - looking
Sato - village
Miyasumi Misato.
//Astonishing, I know, in fact, functionally impossible, but... this doesn't work with furries. -GHS
It's Senpai.
Those were the words of Senpai,
the red of Senpai.
             『You are always alone, are you.』
//Removed the speaker tag, centred. -GHS
Therefore,
        『Will you not have club together with me?』
attacking is... forbidden.

[Taichi]
"LEEEAVE!!!"

[Misato]
"Wah!"

The sight line implements clearness.
//Intentionally off. Don't blink now, or you'll miss like a third of the VN. See CCZAS. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......ngh."

Headache ensues.

[Taichi]
"Dammit, really..."

This timing it has to have.
Blood and sunset assembled are truly not a good thing.
//Same word for putting together the antenna. -GHS
It's to cry.

[Taichi]
"Well, looks like I troubled you. Wahahah!"

[Misato]
"Sob, sob, sob."

Mai Venus, Senpai, was crying.
//Still off. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Who was it! Who is it that made Senpai cry, show yourself!"

I take a posture of empty-handedness.
//This very explicitly does NOT contain "karate". -GHS

[Taichi]
"My Karade will make you taste defeat!"

[Misato]
"Sob, sob, sob, sob!"
//7xSob. This and her previous line are likely not real. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Senpai, by whom were you attacked?!"

Senpai pointed a finger at me.
//This act also doesn't seem like it's real. -GHS

[Taichi]
"To surmount the self is nearly as difficult as pronouncing the words 'self control'!!!"
//克 vs 支 (from Hasekura), hmmm. About the same difficulty, though "sorry" would prolly be more appropriate. See CCD5001 for where this goes. Given that this scene is the reading key for Taichi's other weirdness, in more ways than one. -GHS

[Misato]
"Peke-kun? Peke-kun?"
//This line is tonally inconsistent with her crying, even writing off the voice acting as erroneously concerned with him rather than with herself. More importantly, these are the seventh and the eight calls of his name, so it connects to that part, not the one right before. This is where the hallucinations REALLY end. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah... yes?"

[Misato]
"Ah, the Peke-kun of always has returned..."
//I wish I could say they're sort of arc words, but "the xxx of always" will barely return after this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"'Tis Taichi, eternally the Prince of Your Love."

On a bent knee.
//Lit. just to kneel, but look at the lavish of furries and that purple up there! He's still gone. And he's totally hiding his erection. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dost ye have need of your worthless servant's Karade?"
//Shakespearian-ish stuff should be correct. If it isn't, it's Taichi's fault, not mine (hey, if the author can say it...) -GHS

[Misato]
"That martial art of meaning incomprehensible you call Karade is quite beside the point, however..."
//See CCC0016A. A little off, IMO, but it's more important the two characters say the same thing. -GHS
[Misato]
"Just moments ago, Peke-kun, you looked like a Robodian, it was scary!"

* Robodian = Misatese for Robot.
//See CCD1001; there's a reason she has a word for it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"A Robotaichi you mean?"
//Is this is his own private Thermopylae? -GHS

[Misato]
"That is what it felt."

[Taichi]
"I was confused."
[Taichi]
"...are you alright now?"

She did not probe deeply.

[Taichi]
"Yes, for the changeover of Dual Boot mai OS is now The Endo in Quickly."
//The recurring computer metaphor; the idea that Taichi is clueless on all things technical and scientific; the idea that this guy keeps thinking himself foreign when he's Japanese (vs. Narnia); and finally, it being hideously, horrendously off-tone. I still think it should've been google translated, tag and all, but alas, this world that is barely ready for a translation with language more complex than basic subject-verb is simply not ready for that Stroke of Genius(tm). -GHS

[Misato]
"I did hear from Hashisaki-sensei that your grades in English were terrible, Peke-kun."
//Bridge-peninsula (same as Tasaki). Only mention of this guy. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That aside, Senpai, quickly, that blood..."
