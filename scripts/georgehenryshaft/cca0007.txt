The cicadas are making loud,
even when it's this hot.
Those guys are always serious.

[Taichi]
"Well then."

What do I do now.
With the rooftop under the blazing sun, that's not really a place to cool off in.
//The thing about Misato saying it's gonna get hot is a load; this isn't 9AM. She was just telling him that to send him away. There's no way Taichi is so damn dumb to believe her; this is a hint that the previous scene shouldn't gel with this, cicadas or not. -GHS
I tried peeking inside a class nearby, sure enough, a lesson was in progress.
First Year, Class E.
//High School. -GHS
The class is being taught by Machiko-sensei.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
Satou Machiko.
//Curiously 佐藤真 Satou Makoto is a documentarist, nothing I can see, but 智子 Tomoko is a character in To Heart... nah, too random, it's obviously not it. There are some people with this name, but nothing obvious unfortunately; this will be so for most names. Either they're just red herrings or they're specific people I simply have no idea how to source. -GHS
Beguiling not just by being the possessor of
a Glamorous Dynamite Body of the impressive
height of 173cm that is nevertheless
beautifully shaped as well as being posh with
those brand-name rimless glasses that so suit her
and her long hair with its dark blue highlights
that in ample fashion-consciousness she keeps in
a tied-up hairdo but by having bewitching
glossied fleshy lips as well, she ranks among the
strongest life-forms in my tastes.
//Begin Walls of Text! More than a few parallels to Misato, as well. Glasses, ass, big boobs, elegance... GIS "髪アップ" for hairdo reference. Oddly he uses a similar term as S rank (see CCA0006), but he'll later define her as just A rank. Left 'life form in' due to various later karade/alien shonen antics. Let's say he doesn't see her as human, in this case; First Year Taichi is certainly less of an 'expert' than Second Year Taichi. A nice 7 in the middle of a 1 and 3, 1+7=8... hum, is that a 3 and a 7+3=10 as well? -GHS
In her second year of teaching profession.
She had became teacher for the same class
year as us.
//It's actually uncertain if these two flow together, I suppose intentionally because "second year" could then easily misread as meaning Taichi is a second year, when he isn't in this flashback. The hint is above in how she teaches first years, although that may only be on this particular hour on this particular day. -GHS
Nowadays female teachers are something
pretty habitual,
//Begin Walls of Ambiguity! "Female teachers are normal these days" + "these days I'm used to female teachers so I don't molest them so much" -GHS
nevertheless, Machiko-sensei is sinful.
//More Misato parallels. -GHS
Sinful to the core.
//Lit. "sinbaby", which sounds less silly in Japanese, but not entirely so. -GHS
It could probably be said that this wealth of
sins does include protrusions that force upwards
her shirt from the inside.
The body itself may be slender and well-
proportioned yet the breasts are abundantly
voluminous so that at any moment they would
tear the shirt wouldn't they and the PI-shaped
motions at the instant of tearing would make
display of thousands and thousands of polygons
in separate independent left-right motions a
most definitely magnificent view no mistake,
and I became so immersed in this kind of thoughts
when I was taking her bewitching classes that I
became fairly worthless from a multiplicity of
angles.
//These should merge, though they're erroneously kept split in the console version. 3.14 is of course 3+1+4=8, but now consider CCD1001: more Misato references. Three bugs on a plate seems less 'work of demons' and more the kind of 'ewwww' one'd have when faced with the evil that are vegetables, but, ahem, last one means he gets hard. Leaving the what, exactly, makes him hard (class or thoughts) intentionally ambiguous. The polygons would be what are traced by the nipples on bursting (think Team Ninja) back from that you pervert good but it's also a hint of how they would be virtual boobs, i.e. breast physics (think team Ninja again) now see CCA0027. -GHS
And speaking of her buttocks, their sheer
infernal diabolicalness would make them
a dangerous weapon by themselves,
//Guess why I picked this reading... -GHS
equally as dangerous as a knife in the
hands of a broken 14-year old boy.
//Except Taichi's between 15 and 16 by now, since he's 17 by the end of Summer next year (birthday would therefore be between this early Summer and September - wanna bet it's July 7?). So while it is a big hint in hindsight because this is Psychopath High, unless he got into school at that age i.e. he killed everyone at the Mansion not a year and a half before, which is impossible because he was at Gunjou at 13 for the Cultural Festival where he met Sakuraba, the true focus is the 7x2 in there. -GHS
Those round hips under the strain of having been
crammed tight into the Area of Youthful Male
Covetousness known as the depths of her Tight
Skirt seemed to say,
//Merged the line before and after the below. Couldn't make it work without losing too much steam otherwise. The Tight Skirt BGM title likely refers to this line. -GHS
     『Aw, it's so tight here that this
      beautiful flesh of mine just can't relax!』
//Origins of that あちき http://okwave.jp/qa/q6894804.html (J only). "I" that implies ex-prostitute, though it's sort of a cliche' in itself. This should sound at least sort-of vaguely off-ish, I guess. -GHS
With a stritch and a stretch the cleft of the
ass created transversal stripes stretched like
bridges in the middle of her skirt that I thought
not five nor ten times to get a cutter and
caaarefully cut them transversally.
//That's the specific SFX adjective for when clothes are so tight that motion causes them to create that kind of ripple, here's a pic and description (in Japanese): http://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E3%81%B1%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A4%E3%82%93%E3%81%B1%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A4%E3%82%93 This should sound creepy on reread, like the knife above. It just means "several times", but let's consider it literally, as it is often a good thing to do with Tanaka: though technically it should mean more than ten times, if he didn't think five nor ten times then seven times would be an appropriate amount. -GHS
She's a dangerous female.
Because of a wicked headmaster and his gang of
ne'er-do-wells, her little sister (female student
enrolled in the same school... brilliant academic
results, excellent at sports and popular with
both genders without distinction) became her
weak point, so that this threatened sibling
may well be what casts her down into the extremes
of forced sexual ecstasy.
//The headmaster is sort of a character in here. I have no idea why or what, though. I suspect he used to be the villain in Taichi's Settei before Miki came in. ...I'm not actually sure who is Imouto here. I wonder if it means Taichi himself in his gender confusion, though in that case she reads like Youko, which gets a big hmmm. -GHS
I desire to protect her from that danger worthy
of a certain French publishing house forever and
always.
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E6%9B%B8%E9%99%A2 it's actually written in katakana, not kanji like here. Curiously, the avid reader of that kind of romance novels would be Yusa, wouldn't she. Is she imouto then? Who is Imouto? I knew I should've watched that instead of Da Capo III... -GHS
As a first year student, Machiko-sensei became
our substitute homeroom teacher, and I repeatedly
and insatiably harassed her until eventually I
made her break down in tears in the middle of
class and take a three day leave from work
without permission, an event I still regret.
//It's around as forced as it is in the original, but that "as a first year student" is intended to recapture that said time hasn't necessarily ended. Whether he regrets his pranks or her reaction is intentionally unclear. -GHS
...and then I was struck with suspension, and
Senpai began teasing me as "Suspension-kun".
//see CCA0002, CCC4006 and more. Uncertain if this is before or after her nickname for him. That students at Evil High would be given leaves of absence for their behavior is just stupid beyond comprehension. -GHS
Well, we got closer because of that, so it's good.
Anyway.
Ever since, the points of contact between me
and Machiko-sensei have vanished.
//It reads sarcastically like "times at which I could grope her", but taken literally it's thematically important. -GHS
Without waiting for second year the substitute
changed, and she was no more even in the class
she was in charge of.
//But did the teacher change, or did she stop existing to Taichi due to what is possibly still a trauma for him? -GHS
Fare thee well, memories of the green.
//See CCC3004, CCD2002 -GHS
I just wish I had the kept sexual harassment
within moderation.
But if being hated was the result no matter what,
then I wish I had given a further once-over to
all that, though having those thoughts at this
point means that I'm all but done as a person.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

Anyway, if I keep loitering in the corridors like this someone'll find me.
Let's go to the club room after buying a meal ticket.
The explosive birth of a perfect project.
//See CCA0006. -GHS
Meal set A is usually sold out by third period, so if one wants to eat it with certainty they have to be heading towards the cafeteria as soon as first period is over.
Even then, there's a bit of a line,
therefore some will come back late for second period at times.
If this happens frequently enough, occasionally they seem to remember to make the official promulgation of the Prohibition of Meal Ticket Pre-Sale.
But it'd be better if they just made more of them.
Everybody thinks that.
However, to cut back on waste or something, the set meal being available in limited number is an iron rule.
//The supply will not change in response to changes in demand. This is a strongly capitalist critique of this kind of behavior by state-run institutions, well in line with Tanaka's masked but fundamentally subversive and ultimately culturally anti-Japanese attitude. Just wait until below! -GHS
Therefore, there's no way I'm missing this opportunity.
As it's midway through first period there shouldn't be a line.
It was almost entirely uninhabited.
//"Garasuki". It will be one of the descriptions of the Cross World. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Madam, set meal Ace."
//Unknown if this is Yusa's mom... -GHS

I was able to buy my meal ticket without problems.
//...but I suspect it is, with the actual chat being snip'd. -GHS
Easy life mine, just an easy life.
//Wait a second I just noticed this BG doesn't have any empty boxes of Mikan! This is NOT a proper club room!!! -GHS
On entering the club room, a male who was sitting on a folding chair and reading a magazine raised his head.
//See CCD1001: he calls women a fairly creepy "females" back then, and see below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well well well, if it isn't Tomoki-sensei."
[Taichi]
"What a coincidence finding you here. Are you doing 'that' as well, Sensei? You will offer me something to wet my lips as well?"
//Drinking. This is clearer with the thing below about the milk carton. Curiously the expression seems to be tied to alcohol drinking, perhaps since CCZRooftop was cut it lost this connection? -GHS

I raise a pinky.
//Means girl/girlfriend. Tomoki has a GF and Taichi's jealous, see below. Odd he'd do it here, though see CCD3003 when Miki does it. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Well..."

He answers with a sullen face.
//Tsukkomi fail. -GHS
Tomoki's the type that just can't ad-lib an effective counter on time.
At a social mixer he'd be categorized as the nice but boring guy, no mistake.

[Taichi]
"Cutting? Cutting aren't you?"

[Tomoki]
"You too."
[Tomoki]
"Our class became self-study, 's all."
//See CCA0022. Is that just a free period? -GHS

Returning his eyes to the magazine once again, he sipped coffee milk from a carton.
I see.
He slipped out of that, then he came here to relax a bit.
That damnable vice of people with the Nice Guy Attribute of acting worse than they are.
//"Attribute" will recur. This is specifically discussing his character archetype. Sooo very telling of Taichi more than Tomoki, isn't he? See below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Meal ticket?"

[Tomoki]
"Bought it."

[Taichi]
"Not bad."

[Tomoki]
"..."

Ostracism?
//Ignoring him, but not the same way Touko does. シカト会 is more of an obvious misreading than an alternate one to 'is he giving me a cold shoulder?', but it's so awesome I was tempted to use it until practically the final moment. -GHS
That sends me down a bit.
The division of characterizational labor in the Broadcast Club is basically voluntary, so it can't be expected for Tomoki to get carried away when he's in charge of the Straight-Man role.
//Ah, these are the design docs that Tanaka interwove throughout the story. This would mean "I didn't have specific character roles in mind when designing the Club", see CCA0030. I don't think you can use "characterizational", but "division of labor" just demands that form. -GHS
I looked outside from the window.
Strong sunshine.

[Taichi]
"Another hot day today, innit."

[Tomoki]
"There's still one left in the fridge tho."
//This connects to above. He thinks Taichi's just being annoying because he wants a drink. -GHS

[Taichi]
"80 yen was it?"
//Number eight... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Yep."

[Taichi]
"I shall be taking it, yes."
//Girly. -GHS

I drop coins into the proffered hand, and opened the provisions refrigerator.

[Tomoki]
"...uhm, but every coin here has the Shoushou-in engraved on it instead of the Byoudou-in...?"
//...and the number eight is false. Can't find any coin that actually does, probably just a horrid pun. Adapted to fit. See CCC3012B, CCC3019B. -GHS

Ignoring the objection, I sucked on the carton.

[Tomoki]
"Aww."
//Betrayed, and his reaction is... nothing. -GHS

With no further pursuit of the matter, listlessly the time flowed on.
My gaze turns to the several monitors, lined up in a row together with other equipment, arranged on the long table by the window.
//As mentioned, it's literal monitors here, not transceivers, making this line be somewhat nonsensical. I wouldn't consider a cassette stereo, randomly tossed together speakers, a boom box and what seems to be a line of old Macintoshes(?) as "broadcast club equipment". Unless that's intentional, this BG is fairly thorough design fail. -GHS
It's the equipment of the Broadcast Club.
Immediately next door is the Broadcast Room itself.
This is the ready room, so it's a gathering area.
//The point is the division between the two. This is the side seen; like the city beyond the mountains, what's on the Other Side is of no consequence. -GHS
It's nice that there's electricity, so there's a small refrigerator, game consoles on reserve, and cellphone chargers lined up in a row, making this into the foremost lawless space inside the school.
//And no one goes inside to see all this stuff. Don't clubs have supervising teachers? Compare Mammoth below. Rules in this school are applied with the same zeal as Misato does. -GHS

[Taichi]
"My, isn't the wiring of the machine disconnected?"
//Specifying wiring as that's what Tomoki's good at when it comes to the antenna, also see CCX0001. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I'm putting together a new machine, so I'm changing stuff around a bit."
//He's assembling a new PC, though it actually isn't said that it's a PC, the term is the generic one for "antenna equipment". This is quite odd. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."

Tomoki here is quite the PC guy, and a lot of conversations bloom between him and Miki about CPU and RAM and those things.
//Her archetype isn't as visible as, say, Touko's, but Miki is intended to be a Genius Loli. In reality, I doubt Miki and Tomoki exchange as much as five words throughout the story. -GHS
He has a cute girlfriend from another school one year younger than him that he seems to have met on a BBS.
//Should be an Internet forum, not a literal BBS. Not that the two aren't called the same in Japan. "From another school" means she's a Normie, but apparently from the same town. -GHS
I once met her myself when Tomoki was hospitalized.
//When Misato cut his tendons, meaning the event dates to when Taichi and Tomoki knew each other, meaning no more than a year before. Likely it wasn't weeks before, as well, as in CCD1001 he says the event was a year before i.e. now. -GHS
She came during visiting hours.
//HACK dim the screen. -GHS

[Girlfriend]
『Ah, uhm, tha-, tha-tha-thank you for taking care of Tomoki-kun...!』
//HACK restore screen -GHS

And she bowed her head, that Ultra Kyute life form so unique just in the elegant way she wore her uniform, that my memories are still vague from the shock of meeting her.
//He's using life-form just like with Machiko. See CCD1001 and above: beats the utterly contemptuous "female", so that's why I used the equivalent 'male' above. Also see CCD0002: he didn't always treat Tomoki with even this little respect, either. The vagueness of memories is the same as CCA0001, so his memories vaguefy from shock as well. MEMORY HUNTER!!! -GHS
That girl... Yuka-chan was in the most gallant service of Tomoki even after that.
//Haruka seems most common - curiously, an alternative reading of Miki's name is harukI - but since she's basically Yusa who's basically Misato, her name might as well be close. -GHS
Make no mistake, if Tomoki were just to ask, she'd strip off and hand over her panties.
//See CCA0030. -GHS

[Taichi]
"........."

[Tomoki]
"OW-! Whassat for?!"

[Taichi]
"I felt annoyed all of a sudden..."
//...but is it because Tomoki has a girlfriend, or is this about Youko? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Huh, with what? I don't get a watch of whatcha sayin'."
//Just a hideous pun. Dumped something appropriately crappy in there, since that's the point. -GHS

Even Tomoki's gags are the height of boring.
It's just wrong for that cute GRRR(l) to stick to this guy. It's filthy.
//http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/search/?keyword=%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC&submitSearch=Search+SFX&x= hmmm, going with grrr+girl. The comparisons with Youko continue, see CCA0027. -GHS

[Girl]
"...heheh!"

I could hear a giggly laugh.
//HACK everyone say hi to Miyuki. Yes, I have the doll files from the 360 edition; what I don't have is the damn mask files with which to cut them from the deep black background, so they're completely useless! Unfortunately the mask files seem to be that damn 'type 2' that Asmodean's spc2bmp doesn't support. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Myyy, she was here?"

A bespectacled girl of small build was there, likely having come out of the broadcast room.
//What was someone with a pathological fear of solitude doing alone in the broadcast room? When Tomoki was here? The answer is simple, if we go by what Taichi does usually: fantasizing and flashbacking. And she came there without him noticing. And wait just a little! -GHS

[Girl]
"Always like this, you two Senpai..."

[Tomoki]
"'You two'..."
//Sounds ugly, but -gata is too uncommon to leave and it's used like twice. Regrettably adapted. Payoff in CCB0006. -GHS

She was Fukuhara Miyuki, a Kouhai of mine.
//Same Hara as Touko's last name. Fuku here is "fortune". -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Hail. In spirits?"

[Taichi]
"Ohhh? Oh-my-myyy?"
//HACK Miyuki frown -GHS

[Miyuki]
"Wh-, what is it?"

Miyuki leans back guardedly.
//HACK Miyuki sad -GHS

[Miyuki]
"You're still gonna call me plain again are you?"

[Taichi]
"Why you so plain, why!"
//HACK Miyuki frown -GHS

[Miyuki]
"Awwww..."
//あx5, but see below... -GHS

The girl shook with a clattering.
//...what's she even so nervous for? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yeaaah... whyyy you... whyyy you even so plain! Whyyy does the rubber of your hair bands look so cheap, hm? Why are your eyebrows all thin and faint like this? Why isn't this skirt just a little bit shorter?"
//HACK Miyuki shock -GHS

[Miyuki]
"Kyah! The skirt, really now..."

[Taichi]
"Yeeeah."

[Miyuki]
"Please don't gently stroke the back of my neck! KYAH! Don't put your fingers inside my eaaar!"
//See CCZDXC. Mi(yu)ki. -GHS

Attack of caresses.

[Taichi]
"So the outside is fine theeen!"

[Miyuki]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"Wasteful, so wasteful!"
[Taichi]
"So wasteful I wanna eat it aaall!"
//HACK Miyuki frown -GHS

[Miyuki]
"Huh?"

Caplico!
//WOOOAAAAH they like exist in the west and all??? I think this is a sound effect. Food isn't normally sound effects, but in Japan it's known to happen, about as frequently as random outbreaks of gender-bending. -GHS
I bent over her and bit into her ears.
There it was, the smell of young girl.
//See Youko now. -GHS
I may say this in the tone of a fairy-tale, but make no mistake, this is sexual harassment.
//HACK Miyuki shock, shake screen. Unfortunately, since the doll and the screen are not independent, I can't shake the doll alone. -GHS

[Miyuki]
"AwAaAaAaAaA!!!???"
//あx8 in that second part... but WAIT! There were x5 above, weren't there? Now add the first A and the A in the 'wah'. That's 7! -GHS

Miyuki peaked into ecstasy (lies).

[Tomoki]
"...just stop that already, you damn bully."

[Taichi]
"Oh, lookie lookie, you got a girlfriend damn you but you're engaging in further Lock-On?"
//Sad Miyuki obviously reacting to Tomoki's line can stay on the console version. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Th-, that's got nothing to do with this!"

[Taichi]
"Why, you Lovellatio Sniper!"
//Love + fellatio (see CCB2007) -GHS

Pah!, I spat his way.
//Recurring (somehow). -GHS

[Taichi]
"But the Rifle of my Love always and forever aimed at plain little---"
//HACK Miyuki will see you next route -GHS

The instant I moved my sight, the Broadcast Room door shut,
and the lock turned.
//She can disappear in the blink of Taichi's eye. Erasure of presence, in short. -GHS
Miyuki is no longer among us.
//Lit. "not here", but given the whole theme about presences, living and more, I'll use this as a form of Pretentiously Pretentiousness that Pretentiously Pretentious etc. etc. etc. at times. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nmuh."

I glare at Tomoki, who's reading a manga while pretending nothing happened.

[Taichi]
"Is that gentleness perchance the trick to becoming popular?"
//Formal. See CCC4012. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Oh, forget it. More importantly, how come Miyuki's here?"

[Tomoki]
"...look at you perfectly alright with calling a Kouhai without honorifics."

[Taichi]
"She's a Kouhai innshe?"

Silence.

[Tomoki]
"I respect that part of you."
//See CCA0029, perhaps CCD1001B. Tomoki might sort of like Taichi that way; he certainly likes his ability to be way ruder than him. See above, the line about Character Attributes: someone is imitating here. -GHS
[Tomoki]
"...Fukuhara's class is also self-study, that's all."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, got it, got it."

With the enigma solved the interest vanished.
//Very telling this line. Taichi's someone who holds interest until it's all solved. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sooo I just repelled someone again, have I?"

[Tomoki]
"...mebbe."
//But not him. -GHS

He straightens his sitting posture.
The sunlight of Summer doesn't yet spread throughout the room.
//I think this is just because of where the room is located on the building. Guessing North? I should point out that this kind of sentences are just used to glue together scene bits that don't actually flow together and look written separately, but maybe I shouldn't unravel this thing TOO far. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The Broadcast Club is sooo nice. Nice even just 'cause we can use this room."

[Tomoki]
"Ain't that right."

Even Tomoki's replies are listless when he's reading.
//Just like Taichi's when he's in his delusional mode. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...what'cha reading there?"

[Tomoki]
"Psychoman."
//Although a guy named Saikoman seems to be the villain in an old one-shot anime movie in-author crossover between Ninja Hattori-kun and Perman called ESP Wars http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4742 that's very much insufficient to call it a reference. Far more likely it's just about the Saiko multiple meaning from CCA0001 (and more importantly CCA0030). Might be something of a Ultraman/Superman reference, too? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yatsuka dies, the true culprit is proven to be Masaki."
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%AB%E6%9D%9F%E7%94%BA <- hmmm. But this thing is about epic-level meta. Eight-bundle, the bundle of eights dies; the culprit is pure/true-Saki, same Saki as Tasaki. The Bundle of Eights (there's waaay lots) is killed by Tasaki when True, and the True Tasaki would be the Christian Tasaki. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Don't spoil iiit!!!"

[Taichi]
"Wooon't I!"

[Tomoki]
"Don'tcha spoil the rest! And absolutely not the ending of the Islands of the Demons!"

Push, shove, jostle and struggle.
//Though "a meeting of rubs" is sorta funny in its own way, straight isn't evocative enough. Wait, something involving Taichi and Tomoki being straight is not evoca-GHS
The inner door opens, and from Miyuki's peeking face comes a whispered shout.

[Miyuki]
"Senpai! Teacher's coming!"
//HACK fling the fight GFX towards left of the screen. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Eh?!"
[Tomoki]
"Wha-... Taichi?"

Fool, you're slow to hide.
//He can already kill his presence. -GHS
I was already done concealing myself in a spot blind from the corridor side.
Tomoki is flapping about right and left in confusion.

[Miyuki]
"Senpai, here, here!"

Lowering his posture, Tomoki escapes into the Broadcast Room,
together with Miyuki.
Ah, I wish I'd done that...
Crap, don't you dare cry over something like this, me!
Simultaneously with the closing of that door, 190cm of muscle happened to pass by in the corridor.
//Remember that this is Japan, where the Giant Schoolgirl archetype barely touches 170cm. Machiko was just defined as tall for being 173. Hmmn, 10 surely, but 9-1 is, uhm, hmmm, erm, where's the calculator... 3. -GHS
