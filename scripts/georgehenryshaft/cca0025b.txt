"Understood, Senpai. Then, instead of that..."

[Misato]
"Wha-at?"

[Taichi]
"Sexual things, so to say, have you ever done any?"

[Misato]
"Is this not the wrong context now!"

[Taichi]
"Because I thought, with Senpai it would be fine."
[Taichi]
"Well... I still remember the few words with which you saved me, Senpai, on that school opening ceremony day of the fluttering cherry blossoms, when I had lost sight of all purpose over the death of my little brother..."
//I suspect this is why the Entrance Ceremony got Fixed. Of course, this is all correct except the death of the brother, which would then become the Hasekura Massacre. Is he calling Yutaka his brother...? -GHS

[Misato]
"It shall not deceive me! That Passionate Aura at maximum momentary wind velocity shall not deceive me!"
//Technical term. Although the wind, in this case, is very explicitly the facade. -GHS
[Misato]
"Besides, you do not have a younger brother!"
//...she does, of course, but still. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That one Summer staked on the stitched ball, when for the sake of finally escaping 'him', I intended to give up baseball..."
//And there we go with the baseball. That thing at the beginning sounds like a reference to one of the novels of this guy: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E9%9A%88%E7%A7%80%E5%A4%AB can't source an official translation of his novel ("a youth staked on the stitched ball"), so, close enough. Curiously, 一夏 ichige is also "a three month period from the middle of the fourth to the middle of the seventh lunar month, during which Buddhist priests perform asceticisms, called 'ichige' in Japan" (CP EDR) -GHS

[Misato]
"Wrong, wrong! Baseball is wrong!"
[Misato]
"But more like, are you really thinking of perverted things, are you?"

[Taichi]
"Welll..."
[Taichi]
"After the physical hunger is satisfied, there remains the libido, I think."
//See CCB2010 -GHS

[Misato]
"Rarihooo!"
//See CCA0025A -GHS

A shout out from the window by Senpai.

[Misato]
"If you approach me any more... I will swallow my tongue and die!"
//Adapted. It doesn't make any sense in either language. You can't swallow your tongue and you won't die by biting it off either. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You-, dislike this that muuuch?!"

It's to cry.
I knew it, humans are their looks.
//Annnd back he goes. -GHS
ordinary things like love are not allowed to this boy with the ugly white hair.
But maybe, Senpai will concede me my perversions, if I genuflect.
//YESSSSSS -GHS
I feel like one more try.
