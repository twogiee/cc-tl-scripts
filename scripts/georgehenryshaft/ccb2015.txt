[Taichi]
"Ohhh, smell that!"
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

The number of guards is pretty low.
Or should I say, there ain't any.

[Touko]
"Look at how empty it is, you mean, there's no smell."
//Originally she's confusing 'suitoru' with 'suiteru', which means "uncrowded", and saying there's no one at all rather than being not crowded. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

So sweet. That's what I thought for just an instant earlier.
//The smell and her? Well, olfactive hallucinations are par for the course here. -GHS
Anyway, the cafeteria was deserted.
Thanks to that, even menus with a high rate of competition can't be comfortably obtained... at all.
No sign of people in the depths of the kitchen either.

[Touko]
"...so we have come here, now what?"

[Taichi]
"Well, I thought we'd get tired with croquette bread alone 's all."

I guess Sakuraba's here,
there he was.

[Taichi]
"......"

Sakuraba had died.

[Sakuraba]
"...ngh..."
//Him still moving makes him a zombie. Tanaka's ability to straddle that line between the respectful and the skewering with jokes like this is absolutely amazing. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You've been eating all this time have ya."

Dumbass.
There was a lot of curry bread left over.
//No more croquette? -GHS
I grab one case,
open one of its contents and eat it.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm."

No evidence of spoiling.

[Taichi]
"...come to think of it, if these have been here since Monday, that means they bring them here on Sunday right?"

Up until this moment it had been over four days since the last time humanity had existed.
//Or, around 10 AM. -GHS
Why has food not spoiled?
I don't know.

[Taichi]
"Look, it doesn't seem spoiled."

[Touko]
"Ah, you did poison tasting..."

[Taichi]
"What did you think I was doing?"
//HACK no doll change -GHS

[Touko]
"...ngh, ngggh, forget about it!"

This gal's thinking that I'm going to monopolize all of this, isn't she.
//See CCB0022? Forced. -GHS

[Taichi]
"When people go to so much trouble to watch that no one smacks your rearside eggs..."
//HACK more shocked Touko instead -GHS

[Touko]
"Eh, rearside eggs... what?"

I deck Touko's for'head.

[Taichi]
"Smacks 'em, smacks 'em!"
//HACK angrier Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"Ow, owww, that hurts!"

[Taichi]
"Eat."

[Touko]
"What are you saying what are you doing... really..."
//In a row. -GHS

She bites down while perplexed.
//HACK less suspicious Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"...spicy."
//Curry -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bitter taste in your mouth, eh."
//HACK moe Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"Wanna drink..."

She holds down her mouth.
She's got a weak tongue.
I take out the canteen.

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Touko]
"Ah!"

She tears off the cap then stares at the neck.

[Taichi]
"...what is it?"

[Touko]
"You're running low."

[Taichi]
"? It's fine, drink up. I don't need it. I got water reserves."

[Touko]
"...did you drink before?"

[Taichi]
"Eh, I did drink, what of it?"
//HACK closed-eyes Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"......you did then."

What's on her mind?"
It can't be?!
The indirect kissing?
//See CCA0026. -GHS
Strong throbbing of the heart.
//Not sure about the PS2 version, but this scene on the 360 has the controller vibrating throughout. -GHS
It was the first time I had seen this.

[Touko]
"...it's an indirect kiss, is it."

[Taichi]
"......"
[Taichi]
"............"

[Touko]
"...Taichi?"

[Taichi]
"oooOOOOOH!!!"
//Total x8 -GHS

[Touko]
"B-, what's that mean?"

I twisted her nipples.

[Touko]
"KyahUhnh?!"

[Taichi]
"Replay, pleeze!"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

Sunk.
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

[Touko]
"...those aren't switches!!!"

[Taichi]
"Right..."

[Touko]
"And besides, what's even to 'replay'...?"

[Taichi]
"That line you just said, I wanna hear it one more time!"

I get up.

[Taichi]
"So, a replay!"

[Touko]
"......nono."

And now a 'nono' came out.
//It's a moe word, ya-yo. Buuut according to the Curse of Mikaka, that's 7 and 9, i.e 16. -GHS
A lavish banquet we have here.

[Taichi]
"I knew it, I need that."

[Touko]
"Need what?"

[Taichi]
"Wait here."

I go to the classroom,
and bring it back.

[Taichi]
"Videocamera!"

It still has batteries.
Set up,
switch on.

[Taichi]
"Now, if I may be Pressing to Yuu to say that line once more!"
//急 kyuu 'urgently', adapted since it recalls that line, see CCB2010 -GHS

[Touko]
"What do you even want me to do here!"

[Taichi]
"......huh?"

[Touko]
"Don't act dumbfounded!"
[Touko]
"You're making it look like I said something weird, aren't you!"
[Touko]
"Eh, but... why can't I have a recording now?"
[Touko]
"Why do you even need to record this at all!"
[Touko]
"...because I want to save it?"
//Specific 'save game' term. Toootally a coincidence, just like the sex scenes are called Recollections and are apparently recorded by Taichi on the camera. -GHS

And I lean my head to the side, looking doubtful.

[Touko]
"Why are you putting that like a question! And why would you even want to save this!"
[Touko]
"What? Did I say something weird?! Something so funny that I need to be made look stupid in this roundabout way?! I... I think of you so much but do you have any level of interest in me whatsoever except as some laughingstooock?!"

Complete ignition.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, you, gladden me with calming down a bit..."
//See CCC0026. -GHS

[Touko]
"○×△□＄＃％＆○×△□＄＃％＆!!!!!!!!"
//Audio file also seems too compressed to recover. -GHS

Whoooa!
Well, if it's gotta be this way.

[Taichi]
"My memories with you, that's all I wanted to record!"

Touko's curtain lecture stopped on the spot.

[Touko]
"...you do?"

[Taichi]
"So that one day I could look back on the happy times we are having now."
[Taichi]
"Hahah... was that bad of me?"
//ハ (katakana ha) vs　八 (kanji eight). No coincidence, of course. Since there's two, that's 16 1+6=7. -GHS

I scratch the back of my head in the style of a young unsophisticated "now I've done it" boy.

[Taichi]
"I'm just a young boy that truly likes you, Touko, so what I've said is true... I just wanted to freeze these beautiful memories to have them forever and ever!"

[Touko]
"Taichi... likes...!"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

R'eggd!
//Hishiri. Imma start putting out a reward on the head of these lawless non-Joyo SFX... going with something びしり-ish. -GHS
Clingingly hugged.

[Taichi]
"Touko! I do not necessarily dislike you!"
//See CCA0030, similar behavior. -GHS

[Touko]
"......eh?"

[Taichi]
"Ahhh (sigh of longing), Touko!"
//Used this in CCB2007. He's so faking it. -GHS

[Touko]
"Ah... Ta-, Taichiii!"

Extinguishing successful.

[Touko]
『Ah, ngggh... come... ah! ah! ah!... I am, coming... nghkhhh!!!』

A pressing FUKING.
//~FUKK~ it *chug* -GHS
That was the videocamera's playback function,
//Scene recollection function, hence the save game-like term. -GHS
and furthermore at a high volume.

[Touko]
"...eh... my voice?"
[Touko]
『Nh~~~h, ~~~~~~!!!』

Pagyuh?!
//http://black.sakura.ne.jp/~izmi/hensankutiguse.htm#8 seems like a Comic Party reference, but that's untranslated. See CCZDXC. -GHS
My thoughts came to a halt.

[Touko]
"Ho-, hold on hold on!!!"

She distances from me.
//HACK angrier Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"Sakuraba?!"
//HACK out with 'er -GHS

Sakuraba was sitting in front of the camera, attentively watching the images.

[Sakuraba]
"......"

Calling him yields no reply.
He's watching intently.
A face as if to cry, Touko peeks into the built-in monitor over Sakuraba's back.

[Touko]
『...ah... come!... com-, cominnng...... Ah...... com...』

Intercourse replay.
//HACK and back -GHS

[Touko]
"Clu-, clu-clu-clu-clu-cluele-???"
//"Clueless[ly]". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Chicken?"

[Touko]
"That'sWhat-sqWhat-sqWhat?!"
//...well I tried. -GHS

Then it was a parrot.

[Touko]
『Ahgwh... ahw... ngh...』

[Taichi]
"Ahahahah!"
[Taichi]
"Truth is I was shooting before... ahahaaah!"
//HACK eyes-closed Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

Touko's very presence changes.
//HACK out again -GHS

[Touko]
『......hah... haaah... fwhah... dy-, ying...』

The Touko in the monitor comes hard enough to pass out.
Then the girl looked and saw,
//~invert~ -GHS
what had happened after that.

[Touko]
『...nh... mcHk... rhrh... nHnh... nhhh...』

[Taichi]
『Suck it all out, even the one left in the urethra.』

[Touko]
『...aHm... nh... nnnh... pchk, pchk.』
[Touko]
『nRhrh... pchrk... chk... nhn...』

[Taichi]
『Banzaaai, banzaaai!』
[Taichi]
"......"

[Touko]
"......"

Standoff.
//This brings Touko back without need for changes. Way creepier... -GHS
Squished,
the air in the room warps.
//HACK the calm before the storm... -GHS
Touko laughs with a smirk.
Th-, the pheromones of a beast?!
Which is to say its thirst for blood?!
It's expanding to fill the entire cafeteria!!!

[Touko]
"......ai."

Muttering.
Did she lose her mind?
I strain my ears.
//As he did with Misato, see CCA0015B, and Touko, see CCB0014C. -GHS

[Touko]
"...zaaai... banzaaai, banzaaai, banzaaai, banzaaai."
//Hum, just 6 total? -GHS

Mechanically repeating my line while displaying a faint smile?!
This is bad!

[Sakuraba]
"One thing I'm curious about. Talking seriously."

Sakuraba raised his hand.
There is safety in silence. Remember, the pheasant would have lived but for its cry.
//Curiously, there was no furrying there. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Is this intercrural? Or is it main photograph---"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Suddenly, in the middle of his line, Sakuraba collapsed,
and did not rise.
It's as if his power switch had been toggled.
//Cough cough. -GHS
On looking, Touko's hand is projected towards Sakuraba.
Yet there is no physical contact.
Merely her hand, out-thrust, nothing more.

[Taichi]
"Via chi?!"

[Touko]
"Banzaaai, banzaaai, banzaaai, banzaaai..."
//No, that's 10. Unless we count the complete ones alone: then it's 8. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ha-, haWahWahWah!"

Clank!
When did she even summon the Harakiri Blaaaaaade?!
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

//See CCA0027 -GHS

[Touko]
"...banzaaai, banzaaai."
//Now they are 10-12. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ha-, have mercy!"
//PCP CCA0012 -GHS

Spitting out the words of submissions repeatedly screamed by the heroines in a latter period work of Kajiw*ra Ik*i, I genuflect.

However.

"I said who the hell are you!"

You tasteless auditory hallucination!

[Touko]
"Kurosu Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Buuut! You burned all my porn books, Touko! I'm telling you, I need a replacement side dish!!!"
//...see CCA0015? There's absolutely zero reason to keep 'dattebayo' as even a reference, since kawaii narUhto, unlike equally kawaii kingdom harts, started 1999. -GHS

[Touko]
"I shall make two, yes."

Make two?
But there's only one of me!

[Taichi]
"If things have to be this way... I shall not be silent either! Mine is non-aggressive defense!"

There is a country that advocates this same policy, but in opposition to suspicious ships that boldly trespasses through territorial water I can't be satisfied with less than one single warning shot!
//Whaaat country could that beee it's totally Spain. For the less philosophy-minded, the principle of non-aggression doesn't exclude violent self-defense. -GHS
From the Taichi Bag that I brought with the camera I extract Mai Dagg...
Eh, not here?!
I forgot it hooooooome?!
Instead, I took out the TV remote, and pointed it at Touko.
//That sounds like a stupid thing to have, but see CCX0001. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Move and I expose you to these pathetically weak infrared rays!"

...pointleeess!

[Touko]
"..."

Enemy performing attack preparations.

[Taichi]
"HyYynh!"
//HACK blackout (and removed the flashing whiteout). This was totally a bug. -GHS

I tossed the remote and held my head, at wits' end.
Yet... no attack.
I open my eyes.
//...since the background fades in pointlessly right afterwards. This I didn't add. -GHS
The figure of Touko, her sword downward,
the videocamera, slowly splitting into two.
Perfect severance.

"HaNYA~N! My high-tech peeping tooool!"

"...the wicked have been severed."

[Taichi]
"Come ooon!!!

Her sword up to the scruff of my neck.

[Touko]
"...is that not preferable to death?"

[Taichi]
"THIS ONE AGREES."
