Right, then.
//HACK A good third of the 'pasta lines were cut from the script. But CCD0020B and that mess of 'pasta is untouched, huh... -GHS
Let's go to the First Years' classroom.
The Mikiri duo might just be around.
There is no one.
Looking closer, their bags have been laid on their desks.
They did come by.
They should be somewhere on school grounds, right?
Thinking over it, school is the midway point between Kiri and Miki's houses.
That school they're used to go back and forth from might be just right as a meeting point, perhaps.
But to do what?
I look outside from the window.
I could see the pool.

[Taichi]
"...ehhh."

They were playing.
Cheerfully.
Faint voices reach me:

[Miki]
"S'oryaaah!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, my haaair!"

I was looking at a happy scene.
Unexpectedly, my physical heart took a leap.
//HACK 4 new lines -GHS
I pin down my chest, so as to confirm that warmth.
A person's heart,
is something I also have,
although just a little bit of.

[Kiri]
"KyAaAh!"

[Miki]
"Ahahahahah, you feeell!"

[Kiri]
"I'll plunge you down!"

[Miki]
"Nooo! If you wet my hear it'll turn into Wakame seaweed!"

[Kiri]
"I'll make you into Wakame-chan theeen!"

Sounds of water bursts.
Ceaseless laughter.
A gentleness that reminds of the soft flowing of hours.
A scene from a gentle world.
I thought I would write this in the diary,
so that I would never forget these emotions.
And I, all throughout, gazed at these two girls lost in their playfulness.
And then... I came to think that the act of calculating self-interested interaction with these girls would become instantaneously fruitless.
//See CCC4024. The parallels with Miki continue. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because I just... only want to see it."
//TAICHY LIKES TO WATCH guessing The Dream. -GHS

Yet all I wish is to always keep this in my memories:
//swap around -GHS
that people who exist right next to each other, as if their presence were natural,
will have with others an exchange of touches that is pleasant for their heart.
//Either he doesn't actually believe this, or what Youko does is much different from merely being there. -GHS
