On waking up, Miki was in my arms.
That's right... we slept while still embraced, didn't we.
//HACK new line. May be intended to merge better with the "missing" sex scene (it's one of the most blatant replacements ever, it's all but shown they do it), but it works well anyway. -GHS

[Miki]
"Fwah..."

Eyes meet.

[Miki]
"...kYAH?!"
//HACK shake screen -GHS

[Taichi]
"Really now!"

[Miki]
"Eh, what? What's this?"

Is she getting upset?
//If you were wondering where Kiri was in the sex scene, she's here: "Release me, you molesterrr!" She all but channels Kiri's line in CCD0016B, as immortalized in Nanaca Crash. Hum, can't actually find a release date for NC, not sure if it's an intentional reference. -GHS

[Taichi]
"We had sex, didn't we?"

[Miki]
"Ah, right... yes oh yes."

Tongue stuck out.

[Taichi]
"Why you..."

[Miki]
"Heh... but, this only gives me that image of normal everyday sexual harassment, that's why!"

[Taichi]
"...yeeeah."

[Miki]
"Ahh, well, I'm not a virgin anymore."

[Taichi]
"Yup! You're now a splendid bitch."
//Not a coincidence at all that this sex scene, like all the ones pre-sendback, was doggie style. -GHS

[Miki]
"Chomp!"

Nose was bit.

[Taichi]
"oWWWch!"

[Miki]
"And with that smoooch!"

She jumped on me.

[Taichi]
"Uppsie."

Embracing each other, facing each other, we smooched.

[Miki]
"Nnh... nhhh... nnnh..."

An exchange of saliva in the morning.
...I erected.

[Miki]
"uh... wh-, what'stiff?"
//What's this + stiffness. More Touko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Welll..."
//3xliters of cum. -GHS

[Miki]
"...wanna?"

[Taichi]
"I wanna but... we alright with time?"

[Miki]
"Ahhh..."
[Miki]
"So instead smoooch!"
//3xo, like in ocelooot (the first o doesn't count). -GHS

Do girls like smoooch-ing then?
//Questioning the use of the term? Maybe a bad pun. -GHS

[Miki]
"Nnnh!"

It's Sunday so I have the alarm clock set for ten AM, but,
//It can be true as much as he wants, but it wasn't the alarm clock that woke him, wasn't it? In fact, it's never heard outside of CCA0004. Ever. The sound effect is exclusive to that script. The batteries can't have run out in just a week, can they? Regardless, the lie remains careful: just because he has the alarm clock set to 10AM doesn't mean it's 10AM *now*. It's far more interesting to wonder why lie about it at this point. -GHS
for one whole hour I smooched with Miki.
//And there's further evidence: it would now be 11. That's impossible, as the loop would be in half an hour. It's no later than 8 as of now (7AM to 8AM...), which leaves Miki with 2 hours to go back and forth from the hokora, and an hour-half for extras. ...not that the loop is necessarily fixed, because it's all in Taichi's head, but I do believe these lines are there to wake readers up that bigger misleads are starting up. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ta-jaaah!"
//Can't source this specifically. There's the Okinawan "やまちっちょーん" yamacchichoon which has Yama in it so it's automatically relevant due to various reasons and mountains, but it means "scattered disorder" so dunno. May just be moesisms. -GHS

A Miki punctually wearing her uniform was among us.

[Miki]
"Refreshedly refreshed!"
//This line can also be read "totally and completely ignorant". Incoming Troll Warnings don't come bigger. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Miki]
"Taichi-kun too, refreshedly refreshed!"

[Taichi]
Yeppp'."
//3xp like a triple futanari and her three penises. -GHS

We took a cold bath the both of us.
//Isn't it convenient that they're taking cold baths, implying that they can't heat the water, yet it's Summer when it would be oh so nice not to? -GHS
It's our treasured drawn water, but today's the last so it's irrelevant.
//Of course they might've gone to the neighbors, but this might also contradict the Touko route. Giving another 30 mins-1h this leaves still abundant time if Miki runs both ways and they started around 8. Curiously, I can't source the term to mean anything but "water we keep around in case of emergencies"... -GHS

[Miki]
"...what are you doing?"

[Taichi]
"Here."

[Miki]
"Ahhh, bottle's siberianin'!"
//http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q101487355 Reading conflicting reports of the dialect, maybe Tohoku, maybe Kansai, unsure. -GHS
[Miki]
"Eh, but how'd you do it?

[Taichi]
"While we were in the bath, I chilled it with a small fridge's Rapid Mode."
//See Week 1, but it's interesting we never ever see or hear him actually set it up. Process should still take 30-45". Nice to give us all this stuff about timing, right? This is more warning to pay attention to the details around here. -GHS

[Miki]
"It's Ramune, the one with the marble!"

[Taichi]
"80￥ at the Tasaki Store."
//Which he totally paid. -GHS

[Miki]
"Purtyyy!"

[Taichi]
"If you look at the world through a marble, it's all beautiful, glittering and sparkling."
//Assuming ビー玉 marble is a typoon and he meant ビール beer -GHS

[Miki]
"It's so Summerlike."

[Taichi]
"Yup."

We drank Ramune, the two of us.

[Miki]
"Got made all clean and pretty, got treated to Ramune, so then it's about time we go isn't iiit?"

[Taichi]
"I also want to go to Club."
//HACK sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"...you are seriously going to club, then."
//See CCA0015. Similar, though not quite. -GHS

[Taichi]
"All preparations are made."
[Taichi]
"I don't think even with that broken antenna I'll have problems reaching someone."

[Miki]
"Uhm."
[Miki]
"Couldn't we live in the same time, together?"
//More interesting to compare to CCD5001, when Youko will make him the same offer. This refusal and that one aren't quite the same, as here he's also rejecting bad memories which in Youko Sendback he'll be embracing, but they come from the same place: there's no controlling this Ring, and he's about to relearn the lesson he already knows the hard way. As usual. -GHS

In the eyes that ask that question,
there's seriousness.

[Taichi]
"...I'm thankful, but..."
//HACK sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"So you are."

[Taichi]
"I want to forget, really. The aftertaste of all this isn't really good."

[Miki]
"...I've been looking at you, Senpai, every week."
[Miki]
"Ever one of you, Senpai is... not the exact same person, you know?"
//Which once again brings us to the loop not being anything of the sort. If Taichi's different every time despite the reset, either the reset is fake, or he's more than memories and molecules - which amounts to the same thing. The parallels with Yusa who was only shown his surface (but was that all she saw?) continue. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's how it is then."

[Miki]
"The two of us here living and talking, right now, are one-time-only selves."
//SHE will change even if she doesn't reset, as she realized. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But Miki. You forget."
[Taichi]
"My rationality is a very thin thing, and easily torn apart."

[Miki]
"Ah..."

[Taichi]
"If we were always together, it would be a danger for you, Miki!"
//The problem is, she should know it better than him. Way better. And yet she asks! -GHS
[Taichi]
"Miki, you're incredibly cute, so it might be that I will accidentally use too much force or something."
//See CCC4022. He did. She didn't exactly complain. Or break. In fact, this is interesting to compare with Kiri made of glass: she's awfully sturdy, too, far more than her descriptions say. -GHS

I stroke her head.

[Miki]
"...this is not going to work, no."

[Taichi]
"That is how this goes."
[Taichi]
"Well, if you want to be fawned on, you can always depend on the occasional Kurosu Taichi!"

[Miki]
"......"

There was no reply.

[Taichi]
"So, do we go?"
