[Touko]
"Ah, Taichi, I'm so glad..."

She had returned.

[Taichi]
"I just went to the toilet for a bit."

[Touko]
"Yes."

[Taichi]
"But you got immediately like 'that' now, didn't you."
//She ran to him, i.e. she got too dere. -GHS

[Touko]
"...hm, what?"

An affectionate smile,
I held her tight.

[Touko]
"Kyah! Wh-, what is it?"

[Taichi]
"...you just gotta get strong, Touko."
//See CCA0023 -GHS

[Touko]
"What do you mean?"

[Taichi]
"Because right now we can be together, but being so forever is impossible."

[Touko]
"Eh... that's..."
[Touko]
"...again?"

Her voice shakes.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

Conscience aching like a living thing left out in the freezing winter.
//病＋冬＝疼 it's inescapable logic(tm) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Co-, come on, it's because my family has a history of short lives! My father died young from space radiation sickness, my uncle had the Black Death, my grandpa got hereditary Jemand's disease, and my great- great grandpa had Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome!"
//That last one is indeed AIDS. That'd likely make his grandfather among the first recorded cases of it. Also, considering he probably heard his family history while being held by Nanaka, and since both his parents indeed died young and not impossible of natural causes (if unlikely so), there's likely at least a grain of truth here. -GHS

[Touko]
"...sob... sob!... Taichi, you're... throwing me out again..."

[Taichi]
"Told you it's not that! Look, even right now I have a slight case of leukemia! Why, I'm actually wondering if to ask you to manage my funeral and look after my affairs when I'm gone, Touko!"
//See CCX0001. It's not quite sure, but he might, in fact, actually have that leukemia... -GHS

I was the weak one.

[Touko]
"I want to live together... live... always living..."
//"Then live, Taichi! Even if this disease is made to just kill you soon... live! If you just live, then you'll live until you try to kill yourself in that cemetery scene where things got really sort of silly and that's saying something in this series, really." -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is it is, living so very much!"
//Seems a quote or random accent I can't source. Going for the usual (weird) -GHS

I kissed her all over her face.
Forehead, cheeks, lips.
As if pecking at her.
The tears that flowed from the outer corners of the eyes continued to spill, no matter how many times I sipped of the droplets.
...salty.
//OH YEEES TAICHI IS DRINKING YOUR TEARS TOUKO! YOUR TEARS OF PAINNNNNNN! MWAHAHAHA~ -GHS

[Touko]
"...sniff! so, then... more... hold me tighter..."

[Taichi]
"Yes, yes."

[Touko]
"Forever."

[Taichi]
"...yes, yes."

As I keep responding, I put more strength in my arms.
While I did not think it a good pattern to have, I couldn't but abide to it.
But, well, it's honest.
When she is like this, Touko did not seem without charm.
Yes. Up to this point it's fine...

[Taichi]
"...how about going to the beach tomorrow?"

[Touko]
"'each?"

So she repeats with her lisp.

[Taichi]
"We'll invite some of them, it'll be like that time."

[Touko]
"Ah, we went last year."
[Touko]
"That was sooo fun."

[Taichi]
"Weren't you just really angry back then?"

[Touko]
"That was only because you were always doing perverted stuff, Taichi..."
[Touko]
"But,"
[Touko]
"The sexual harassment was bad, but I was so happy you seemed to care about me."

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Dammiiit..."

Squeez'.

[Touko]
"Kyah?"

[Taichi]
"Touko is so adorable, damn it all!"

[Touko]
"...what was it, that... you said like it was some sort of a bad thing..."

[Taichi]
"Love's a game of win and loss. The side that falls in love loses."

[Touko]
"If that's your problem, you don't have to worry."

She rubs the bridge of her nose on the middle of my chest.

[Touko]
"...I'm fine with losing."

Saying that is only going to make things really bad!

//HACK independent BG shake -GHS
WOOOHOOO!!!

[Touko]
"...wha-?"
[Touko]
"Wha-, wha-wha-?"

Touko is making my groing go very very squirmy.
Ahhh, that stimulus she's giving me just makes things worse and worse!

[Touko]
"Wh-, what, Taichi, I say!"

[Taichi]
"...no good."

[Touko]
"What is this... protrusion...!"

[Taichi]
"It was just no good after all."

I couldn't be expected to bear this.

[Taichi]
"It's just no good, Touko."

[Touko]
"It-, it was such a nice mooo〜〜〜d!!!"

[Taichi]
"Forgive me."
//HACK very angry Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"Baka! Hentai! Bird-for-brains!"
//* one of these three is not expressed correctly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Call me whatever you like."

[Touko]
"People are going through sadness and happiness and right then you go and think about that sort of stuff!"
//A surprisingly spot-on diagnosis considering Touko's not one of the brightest of the bunch. -GHS
[Touko]
"DIS! GUSTING!"
[Touko]
"...I-, I wasn't really thinking about...!"
[Touko]
"Well then, how come you got like 'this' then!"

[Taichi]
"It's just... the sad saga of a male, that hopeless an impulse from that inner of territories most separate from thought must spring forth with so much strength it may not be nor by wind nor by rain defeated!"
//Continuing with the random tone change -GHS

[Touko]
"Isn't that just saying you're filthy?!"

[Taichi]
"OBJECTION! Girls have an unbearably nice smell!"
//Igi ari! -GHS

[Touko]
"Sme-, smell you say..."

Stunned muteness ensues.

[Taichi]
"Touko's very smell... so sweet, and so sour... makes me so excited."

[Touko]
"Get-, get off of me!"

My cheeks are mashed and pushed off. The upper part of my body arches.
//Should be similar to CCA0030 -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'buh!"

[Touko]
"GET! OFF! OF! ME! THIS! INSTANT!"

The very mouth that just earlier told me to hold, now is telling me to release!
Nothing but this, even to the gentle version of me...
//it's just crawling in his skin -GHS
!PISSED! !OFF!
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS
I suddenly put more force in the arm that holds her hips.
While drawing her closer, the pressure continues on my, uh, forehead.
//凸部=forehead part, how could 凸 and part possibly mean anything else? -GHS
I violently thrust my excrescence at Touko's abdomen.
//don't translate it as tumor don't translate it as tumor don't translate it as tumor it's not a tumor it's not a tumah either see CCC0000 youko is his dick therefore it's fffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-GHS

[Touko]
"No way!"

[Taichi]
"Th-, this won't exactly be your first time!"

[Touko]
"NO WAY, NO WAY!"

[Taichi]
"Young laaady, resign yourself to the notion!"

[Touko]
"I told you NO WAY!"

[Taichi]
"Yeees then? Yeees then?"

[Touko]
"I absolutely R-E-F-U-S-E!"

In our rubbingsome quarreling, me and Touko became like the letter 'Y' of the alphabet.
//I totally translated this line as "like an upside-down 'person' kanji (Y)", and was about to giggle uncontrollably at MAI GWEATO KREVERNESS, and then... -GHS
The kanji for 'person' is said to represent two people reciprocally supporting each other, but if you flip it over it turns into the letter 'Y', and there's only quarreling.
//HACK ...this new line happened which basically expands the same joke. And then I had to expand it even more because of cultural thingamajigs (technical word). Oh well. This lets CCZAS stand on its own, which I guess it's ironic in a sense...? -GHS
An hour elapsed.
//Or 7 minutes. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Haah, haah..."

[Touko]
"Haah, haah..."

Offense and defense, advance and retreat, and now it had fallen into a stalemate.
Me and of course my counterpart are both fairly exhausted.
//Let's go with saying this means her. Why not. -GHS
But that arm is still pushing in Our face, uncompromisingly obstructing this baiser a deux.
//Let's also say that plural is only used as possessive, and not to imply that the above means the counterpart is his dick. French is likely wrong, but the recall to the folie a deux is probably more interesting. Still no accents due to shit-SHIT -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you're acting as if you're fighting off some Rape Demon."

[Touko]
"And how is that not what I'm doing..."

[Taichi]
"Allow penetration."
//Console: "Let's play doctor" -GHS

[Touko]
"That's what you'd call rape!!!"
//Lady, if he asks for consent that is not rape even in the Near Rape Experience culture. -GHS

Tired, the beating about of the bush disappeared.
//See CCA0027 -GHS

[Touko]
"Women are not mere holes for the men to use!"
//True, they also know how to craft [Unique Item * Sammich]. ...which considering Youko... -GHS

[Taichi]
"You had to say something so damn Tajima Y**ko!"
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%B0%E5%B6%8B%E9%99%BD%E5%AD%90 -GHS
[Taichi]
"This is love you know!"
//愛だ象? -GHS

[Touko]
"Your face is one big slab of carnality!"

[Taichi]
"Do not deny the carnality. It is a natural thing!"

[Touko]
"And you are getting carried on that wave all by yourself!"
//Hum, where did I hear about a wave again... ~denpa denpa~ let's just leave it extremely literal. -GHS

Dammit, this situation doesn't even have rails to fall off from.

[Taichi]
"Okieh, how about we do this then:"
[Taichi]
"I will abandon attempts at penetration. Therefore, your side will also give up one thing."

[Touko]
"...what even?"

We approached the Negotiating Table.
We are tired enough for that.
Under the circumstance that is the Fall of Mankind, disputing penetration while already in a condition of friction is not just abnormal, it is so from the very start.
//That 揉 is particularly nasty here, since that could be read as 'dispute/argument' (te form) here as well. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I want to be satisfied in ways excluding penetration."

[Touko]
"Meaning IN-COM-PRE-HEN-SIBLE."
//Merged last two syllables so it fits in 5 -GHS

Her nails became talons into my face.

[Taichi]
"OwChCh, really you!"

A circular rub on her ass is retaliation.

[Touko]
"KyaOH?!"

[Taichi]
"Do you desire mutually assured destruction now!"

[Touko]
"Guh... that'd be you!"
//See what I did there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hence we go into negotiations. I'm giving up on principal photography (vaginal). It's up to you what to do. 'A' or intercrural or oral or even manual, pick any methods of service you like! Go on!"
//Given this whole thing involves videotapes, it's too appropriate to resist. It'll be sort-of a running gag, like "self-consolation" which somehow works better left literal in just about every instance. -GHS

[Touko]
"...ngh."

Tearful.

[Touko]
"Bwaaah haaa! Whyyy did this conversation turn to sex and services and all that?! No beauty at all, it's so crude, not dreamyyyy!"

[Taichi]
"Hey, that's just gender differences! Men don't listen when you talk but they can read maaaps!"
//Turning American again? I don't really hear much of this stuff from Japan. Not that I bother with anything but incest futa loli scat rape porn from Japan, the rest is all kawaii uguu shit anyway. -GHS

[Touko]
"And-, and what is even 'A'?"

[Taichi]
"'A' is..."

I perform a most precise furthermore fluent explanation on sexual love involving the anus.

[Touko]
"...NOT EVEN DEEEEEEEEEEEEEAD!!!"

Resistance is gaining strength.

[Touko]
"NOOOOO, GRANDFATHER-SAMAAAaAAAaAAAaAH!!!"
//It's sort of silly, I know, but so's the scene. ーx24 (with above) which is 8x3. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Even your grandfather-sama did things just like that to make offspring!"

[Touko]
"But not in that WAAAAY!"

[Taichi]
"Incidentally, your grandfather really loved anal, did he not?"
//I'm suspecting there's more to this than the obvious, but I didn't find anything odd even after googling "grandfathers love anal sex" in Japanese. I mean, seriously, Image Search and with safe search off has some middle-aged guy singing as first result and nothing more scandalous than images of a sex toy's box! I haven't felt so weirded out by Japan since the day I found out there's no otome VN on VNDB tagged with 'high amounts of rape'. -GHS

[Touko]
"Don't toss lies around!!!"

NailsNailsAgghNails!
That was of course a lie.

[Taichi]
"Okieh, 'A' is out."
[Taichi]
"Or rather I should say, we've way derailed. I'll just specify. Do it with your mouth."
//埒があかない, as above -GHS

[Touko]
"...m-, my mouth?"

Resistance is losing strength.
//Mirroring above -GHS

[Touko]
"...the mouth... is something I want to be only for kissing and talking."

Pfui'd.

[Taichi]
"Cheeky... no greedy wolfing down of food with it until you're stuffed?"
//~le lateralisme~ -GHS

[Touko]
"I hate it when you pick at nits, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"Well, you have kissed me before."
[Taichi]
"Isn't that also a kiss?"
[Taichi]
"Ngggh, ngggh, ngggh..."
[Taichi]
"Ahhh, you liked having it done to you with the mouth but when you have to do it you hate it! What a foul play of a female you are, you disgrace to all Bushigyaru!"
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

Bushigyaru---
Taichian for a warrior (Bushido) style girl.
In the same vein as terms now mostly in disuse
like Kogyaru ("child-girl", excessively
trend-conscious teenager) or Magogyaru
("grand-daughter girl", similar but for even
younger girls).
//Waaaaaaaaay expanded. -GHS
In the present situation, there exists one all
over the Earth. However, it seems there also was
exactly one before the Fall.
There's a lesson in there on how continued
subdivision and categorization are not good
things to do.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
Touko's face turned deep red in a split second.

[Touko]
"Wh-, Wh-, wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh..."
//Na+na =7, 7xNa follow. I can't even joke about how astonishing it is that nobody apparently noticed this stuff. -GHS
[Touko]
"Totally different! This from that I mean!"
//Also note how the above line does not transition into this in the original language either. Tanaka's literally rubbing his crotch in readers' faces. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Same thing! I consider each other's genitals as just part of the partner... I went down because I did think that... but you rarely did, Touko... therefore!"
//Kind of odd she'd "rarely" did, since the implication seems to be much closer to "never". -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"For one who chants love, aren't you quite the self-righteous type, hm?"
//I still can't find the origin of that proverb-ish thing. -GHS

[Touko]
"......"

Hesitation.
Distress.
Worry.
And then,

[Touko]
"...I get it I do."

So she says with teary eyes.
//HACK shy Touko -GHS

[Touko]
"I get it, I should do it so I'll do it, if I have to."

[Taichi]
"Weeee."

One blowjob in exchange for all that time and effort.
Sooo very Touko, I thought.
