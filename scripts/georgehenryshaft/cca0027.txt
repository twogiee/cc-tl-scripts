"......blunder..."

Her words sounding somewhat fed-up, Kiri hangs her head.
//Interesting that Taichi is ignoring his own words in the flashback. -GHS

[Miki]
"Sorry, I deceived you. Senpai asked me to do it whatever the cost."
//Even a year before it was nearly impossible to gather all these people. This is likely after Taichi dumps Touko, but not long before Yutaka dies. But more importantly: Miki followed Taichi's orders at the cost of Kiri even back then! -GHS

[Kiri]
"...truth is... today we had planned to go out for Sushi with the family..."
//Yutaka is probably there. Besides wanting everyone together, Taichi doesn't want him around Kiri. -GHS

[Miki]
"C'mon, putting a Senpai in debt is useful in many ways, right?"

[Kiri]
"Salted salmon roe, sea urchin, medium-fatty tuna, what's market price..."
//Might also be related to the above, i.e. she's going to make Taichi pay for all the sushi she didn't eat. See CCC0041 for the long awaited return of Medium-Fatty Tuna! -GHS

Ignoring the army speech, Kiri let a heavy sigh fall to her feet.

[Misato]
"So, what channel did they use for you, Kirihara-san?"
//She IS the one who calls this "Cross Channel". -GHS

[Touko]
"I was told that Hasekura-senpai had something very important to talk to me about the future."
//They do seem to be too friendly to have been shortly after breakup, but that's my best guess as to the timeline. Whether anyone ever quite figures out Youko is Taichi in drag or not, at this point they should still know that they're related. See... crap, can't find it, but there's a line where Misato is warned by Youko about Taichi. I suppose Touko would also know, someway or another, and perhaps hoped Youko would help her get in Taichi's graces. -GHS
[Touko]
"Who'd have thought that VIP would be Kurosu's accomplice...!"

She was shaking her 『Iron Fist * Tekken』.

"Hm? Youko-chan?"

//Immoral capitalized as it's his nickname. -GHS

[Miki]
"What a Yakuza, really."
//Hum, because they watch out for family members way closely? Is it because she researched Youko and knows her family is mafia? It may be more hint that she knows that Taichi's relationship with Youko is nothing of what it seems. See CCD3003, which may relate. Also see end of the script. -GHS

"We were together until a short while ago, but she suddenly vanished."
//To change into costume, of course... -GHS

[Taichi]

Where could she be.

[Taichi]
"Ah, there!"

That silhouette, there's no mistaking this.
And even all up in a swimsuit. What a waste...
//Taichi is of course in a swimsuit, so it's not a lie. After all, the line doesn't say that it's a female swimsuit. And isn't it odd the damn pervert's not describing her, despite it all? This is a first week scenario, we're not supposed to know the exact relationship between the two. -GHS

Seems like that, tentatively, she has decided to "participate" in our beachside outing.

//getting really angry now -GHS
Some people are crying, some people are all shook up,
//Which we're supposed to take as being because They Are Abnormal. But this isn't all that abnormal. -GHS
and I was boiling over because I didn't want to see blood.
I closed my eyes.
//He would close them hard. What happens then? See CCC3012A. Have ears that know how to listen, too: the cicadas have stopped. That one above may have been a joke, but is this? -GHS
"..."
Someone took the can from my hand.
//Right under the nose of everyone, right as Taichi closes his eyes. How does anyone fall for this?! -GHS
The sound of the pulltab.
The sound of liquid being poured on Miki's forehead.

[Miki]
"F'meow?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes, that was it."

[Tomoki]
"Wh-, why did you put tea on it?"
//Doesn't he sound like he's staring right at this? -GHS

[Taichi]
"...because green tea includes Catechin that has sterilization effects, duh〜!"
//still a bit angry. Effect seems true, too, but that's just... an odd thing and weird thing to up and do, doesn't it? -GHS
[Taichi]
"There's a handkerchief in my bag, go get it."
//But he had the tea lying right there? -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Go-, got it!"

I open my eyes,
just as Misato-senpai applied a handkerchief.
//Guessing cold war, but it's still odd. -GHS
Whew.

[Taichi]
"Hurts, Miki?"

[Miki]
"It's still a bit throbby-throbby."

[Taichi]
"At least someone realized about the tea. Who was it?"

[Misato]
"That would be, uhm..."

[Tomoki]
"Really dunno."

[Taichi]
"Whatt't't?"
//Whattt up wittt tttattt. -GHSt

[Misato]
"When it was all bustling, I maybe saw someone with the corner of my eyes."

[Tomoki]
"Same here."
//How suspiciously unspecific. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Maybe same here..."

If we're talking about a human possessing a Super Ninja-like Awareness Comprehension Technique...
It's her.
I look over the surrounding, but her figure's nowhere.
As expectable, then.
//Of course. She doesn't exist. -GHS
And, Touko brought back the life guard.
//Meaning no one was looking at them as they did all this, and the guard was a good five-ten minutes round trip away. How convenient for all the other times, isn't it? -GHS
All club members grew exhausted simultaneously.

[Miki]
"Th-, thank you very much... Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Miki]
"Because you were all screaming 'the tea, the tea'."

[Taichi]
"...I was all confused too. Whyyy couldn't I even explain properly..."

[Miki]
"My gratitude..."

[Taichi]
"Give it to whoever poured the tea."

[Miki]
"But also to Senpai, the same amount."
//She's curiously insistent, considering she should've seen who poured the tea quite well. -GHS

Tearful eyes focused on me.

[Taichi]
"...well then."
[Taichi]
"Lov'ble 'un ye."

[Miki]
"Mnaheow!"
//nah + meow -GHS

And then Miki was taken away by the life guard.
//She was never seen or heard from again. ~end~ -GHS

[Kiri]
"I am going to follow. If you Senpai wish to go home, that will be fine."

[Taichi]
"Sooo do we. No?"
//TL Note: "nou" means "no". Or brain. But that was "ou nou". Wait, that's worry never mind. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Nah."

[Misato]
"We will wait."

[Kiri]
"...uhm... thanks."

After an awkward bow she chases after Miki.

[Taichi]
"Yusa-chan, those girls' so kyuuute ain't 'em?"

[Yusa]
"Eh? The-, they are? They are so adult-like... but I... I am an only child..."
//She's a year under them, and she IS an only child. IOW, she's lonely. Watch out. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Those two look seckshy don't they."
//Odd questions, aren't they. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Hmmm, in comparison to Yusa-chan, they're definitely older."
//As usual, Immoral's material falls flat down on the floor with a splat. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

You are using -chan.
Bit early isn't it?
Could this guy be, maybe, have a Natural Netori Character Attribute?
Definitely requires attention.
//HACK Surveillance level 2. -GHS
In my hearts of hearts, the surveillance level of Tomoki increased by one.
//HACK out the surveillance level graphics -GHS

[Yusa]
"But... you are all good people. Those two, and all you Senpai."
//...but Miki and Kiri are her Senpai too... -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's the strength of the cohesiveness of people close enough to eat out of the same pot. Are you jealous?"
//Adapted a bit because the meaning is likely not instantly obvious in English. At least "eating out of the same pot" doesn't seem to indicate the same level of lesb~ les~~~ lesb~~~~~ """friendship""" it seems to do in Japanese. And here we go: see the final question? It's basically "are you lonely?" in this context. Taichi is having a real bad reaction post-blood. -GHS

[Yusa]
"Ah, yes, very much."
//Awwww shit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You'll soon find a group to join, too."
//Awwww shit x2 -GHS

[Misato]
"...Doujima-san, say, could it be you also are at Gunjou?"

[Yusa]
"Yes, it seems so."
//Likely started last March/April. -GHS
[Yusa]
"Truth is... I was planning to attend a private elevator school, but..."
//Likely in the big City. -GHS
[Yusa]
"...then I had the Conformity Test..."
//Still curiously uncertain whether it's compulsory, it sounds like it wasn't for Touko. Sooo what's her score? It can't be that of a normal person. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Gladden me with being at ease. 'Tis the same for us."
//See CCC0026. -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes, yes! Bullying is absolutely unaccepted at our school, so it is very comfortable."
//*canned laughter*. Becomes even funnier considering 'mitomenai' can indeed mean 'forbidden' or 'unallowed', but also 'unrecognized', in the sense of 'ignored'. -GHS

[Yusa]
"...yes!"

[Touko]
"Hold it, when this girl came around none of us were there weren't we?"
//This line is odd. Of course everyone was there when they entered, if she goes to Gunjou from this year. I suspect this is when Youko brought her in. And with this line, the correct spelling would be "Youko" -GHS
[Touko]
"And you have a lewd look on your face like a total moron!"

[Taichi]
"The fellows that Romance understand naught may go chow down tasteless Ramen at the House on the Sea."
//The ramen/romance thing sorta recurs, capitalized so maybe it's more obvious. Seems to be nothing but a bad pun, as even in Kanji 'romance' is pronounced Roman (and Rouman and Rooman). -GHS

[Touko]
"What's even that!"
//A very good question. This entire thing with Touko is just sorta off. Perhaps intentional. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What's even now!"

[Tomoki]
"Lay off you two... Doujima-san's getting scared!"

My my, putting on airs of a white knight this guy.
//HACK Surveillance level 3. -GHS
Surveillance level rises to 3. If it gets to 4, we have a Netori Hazard for sure.
//It never does, at least explicitly. 3+4 mentioned =7. -GHS
And would I ever even allow that?!
//HACK out the surveillance level graphics -GHS

[Taichi]
"AH!"

I fell down.
I grab on to Tomoki's slips.
//TL Note: literally "Sea Bread" (kai pan). Actually trunks, but see below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoooa!"

Slip!
//See below -GHS
                       Shima Tomoki
                   Height:        172cm
                   Weight:         59kg
                   Penile length:  12cm
//HACK reformatted for acceptable justice. Only in a nukige. No way a 16-odd year old is 170+cm in Japan! -GHS
This organ that possesses an impact and a strength similar to that of a brontosaurus that has already welcomed the final stage of its evolution is presented to the eyes of this innocent girl via the slips (both meanings).
//Sort of funny I guess, but the sentence itself is borderline nonsensical. 'zuru' means a cheat, but also the SFX of slipping down, see above. Now it's slip as in swimming trunks and slip as SFX, given the 'cheat' is Taichi's anyway. -GHS

[Yusa]
"............"

[Tomoki]
"Uw-, UWAAAAAH?!"

[Yusa]
"............"

This girl so pure who's never known her father, gently, as her complexion changes color not, as she emits a loud scream not... parts with consciousness and falls down.
//First and only time we hear Yusa doesn't have a father. Uhm, maybe given her mother it shouldn't be too odd? BTW, Tanaka either has no father, or his father was a non-entity compared to his mother. -GHS
Kirihara, upon sight of Tomoki's Hyper Dragon Bojack (thus christened), ran away who knows where.
//Most similar one is http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Bojack though that's not the exact way it's written. Considering Tomoki's is a Charged Particle Cannon, maybe it fits. No other sources for that particular spelling. -GHS
That damn nitpicker got her own weaknesses.
//See Youko. But it's odd, isn't it? See CCD2002. The reason is that she's just a hypocrite. -GHS

[Misato]
"...(mutter, mutter, mutter)"

Miyasumi-senpai is looking after poor fainted Yusa-chan.
Said Senpai had yet turned deep crimson in the face, half-disgusted, half-embarrassed.

[Taichi]
"Oh nooo, sorry!"
//half-serious -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Be careful will you!"

[Taichi]
"sNorry..."
//Unlistenable Moe Words(tm) + that 'nou' again. Of course it's an actual "no" here. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...I am finished."

Do be finished, do be!

[Taichi]
"Don't toss yourself down! Did you forget the vow we've made to remain Cherry BoyZ until graduation?"
//Going a little literal to recall CCA0016 more. The Z in BoyZ is necessar'ly always capitalized, this is a grammaticanal rule as iron as the prularlization of 千配, check the dictSee CCD0002 -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, I know, it's just..."

He droops his shoulders, crestfallen.

[Tomoki]
"Sigh... maybe I'll swim."

[Taichi]
"I'll go with."
[Taichi]
"Still, Tomoki!"

[Tomoki]
"What now."

[Taichi]
"That thing that was on my mind before."

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"Isn't that Sakuraba?"

[Tomoki]
"...ye-ep."
[Tomoki]
"When there was all the bustle at the start, someone stomped on him."
//Back when they were coming on the beach, well before the mess up with Miki started. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Still alive.."

[Tomoki]
"No way this guy is dying that easily."
//He can stand with his head in the sand for an hour without dying. He's effectively immortal. This, of course, is no joke. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I did think we were one guy short."
//Hum, Taichi, Tomoki, Miki, Kiri, Misato, Touko, plus Yusa. Of course they weren't, there's Youko... ah, whoops. This is another hint, assigned to Sakuraba. The true number is always Seven, it can never, ever be eight. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"A dumb beach outing, wasn't this."

[Taichi]
"But we still had fun."
//Fits better when it'll be 'pastad in CCB0020 -GHS

To my words, Tomoki gave a sigh while still returning his agreement.

[Tomoki]
"...I guess."

Our fun beach outing has with this concluded.
As for Miki's cut, it only left behind a very small scar.
Nevertheless, on the way back, said Miki had the most bright and cheerful face on her,
as if she had obtained something in exchange for being hurt.
//Meaning this is a strong memory for her. -GHS
That's what her face said.

[Misato]
"Sorry, I have a bit of an errand at school."

[Taichi]
"What sort of errand?"

[Misato]
"Club activities, I have some preparations to make."
//They're bringing in the antenna. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"You're way too serious."

[Misato]
"...you're always being sarcastic, Tomoki."

[Kiri]
"That is definitely not true!"

[Misato]
"Eh, is it not?"

[Miki]
"He doesn't say that about anyone but you, Miyasumi-senpai, do you know?"

[Kiri]
"He does not. Because Shima-senpai is so upstanding."
//Translation: he only gets pissed at Misato, no one else. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"I'm thankful for all the praise, but it's embarrassing so cut it out."

[Miki]
"He got mad."

[Kiri]
"...he did get mad."
//See CCX0001, this is the memory from which their 'nice' interactions come from. -GHS

They exchange glances and laugh in a giggle.

[Yusa]
"...(giggle)"

Yusa-chan awkwardly followed their lead.
//"Today I saw the beach. I'm not scared anymore." -GHS

[Misato]
"Well then, we split up here. Thank you for everything today!"
