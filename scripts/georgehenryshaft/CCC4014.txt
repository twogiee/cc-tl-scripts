Work continues.
//HACK to black, stay there for a moment, rooftop zoom -GHS
Miki and Kiri don't really show themselves much.
...obviously.
It's more how I come to school like always that's abnormal.
Still, what's the matter with Senpai?
//She's in the infirmary hurt, which Taichi doesn't know in this route... except for the script right before this. Whoops... -GHS
Noon interrupts me.
Something to eat... I had grabbed some cup ramen from inside Tomoki's supply drop, and brought it with.
I boil some water on the rooftop while I gnaw on a cucumber.
//With what? Camping equipment, I suppose, but it's not quite specified, especially how he ate that stuff raw a few scripts ago. -GHS
...damn, these activities are different from what I imagined.
I had forgotten,
how long ago mankind had gone.
//Yeah, how many years has it been now? -GHS
This is a world of just us eight. No, now it's us seven.
//Think about it: now they're actually seven. (Well, Touko's dead, but...) -GHS
We are as a candle in front of the wind.
I pour hot water in the cup ramen,
and eat.

[Misato]
"...ahhh, Peke-kun."

Senpai had come by.

[Taichi]
"Good morning. You are late you know."
//HACK Miffed Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Yes..."

Feeling down,
and glasses clouded over as well.

[Taichi]
"There was some shocking incident then."

[Misato]
"Yes, very."
//Her wounds... which she doesn't talk about at all. Curiously, this means Youko can't have helped her, so this was all Tomoki. Or herself. Or the actual nurse. -GHS

Sitting in a flop next to me, she stares at the sky, vacantly.
//soff -GHS

[Taichi]
"...talk, and happiness will come back."
//人に話すと気が楽になる talk to people and the spirit will grow happy. -GHS

[Misato]
"I have been... fighting with Tomoki."
//Her getting injured would've meant a pretty big fight with him, as it's not the first time he's rescued her from something like that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh, with Tomoki have you? I also do, and often."

Senpai smiled as if looking very tired.

[Misato]
"That sort of fight is quite different from this kind of fight."
//That's the Tomoki/Taichi & Tomoki/Misato hypocrisy right there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This is about complicated household circumstances, then. Will you eat?"

Senpai gives me a weak shake of the head.

[Misato]
"...we are siblings, the only two, and yet... there is nothing that we can do to make this work well."
//Vs. only eight/seven friends. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because Tomoki has also some obstinacy himself."

[Misato]
"...the fault for this resides all with me."

Wordlessly I urge her on.

[Misato]
"Because I... am a shrew."

[Taichi]
"You are, now?"

[Misato]
"...I am the one at fault!"

She ridiculed herself and played with her bangs.
//See Taichi -GHS

[Taichi]
"Theeen, you are just like me!"

[Misato]
"...is that how I am?"

[Taichi]
"I have plenty I am at fault for. That is why I am in here, after all."
//HACK "happy" Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"...hohoh, then it is suspension, yes."

[Taichi]
"If it is together with you, Senpai!"
//HACK no need -GHS

[Misato]
"Then if we are both suspended from school, shall we do something bad that they will find fault with?"
//First believe yourself guilty; then seek for something to get punished for. Boy is this human behavior. -GHS

Senpai's smile frays around the edges like little girl's.
//Just a little bit... wrong -GHS

[Taichi]
"Awesooome, yes, something baaad."

The iron door made a shrill squeak as it opened.

[Kiri]
"Senpai, get away from that person!!!"

Kiri was armed.
Absolutely not with a water gun.
//See CCC40006. If it's not a water gun, then it's gotta be a BB gun. -GHS

[Misato]
"...zoom?"
//Well ain't this interesting. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Miyasumi-senpai, please hurry and get away from that person!"

[Misato]
"Eh? 'That person'... Peke-kun? Really, calling an upperclassman like that... you will be put on leave from school!"
//Almost, but not quite, suspension. Possibly because suspension is for really bad people. -GHS

[Kiri]
"You are in danger, quickly!"

[Taichi]
"......"

[Misato]
"And that water gun... is that a water crossbow?"
//LOL Wikipedia: "crossbows are also called 'bowguns', but that is Wasai Eigo and doesn't apply in other countries". -GHS

[Taichi]
"That is the real deal."

[Misato]
"Pfh..."

Swooned.

[Taichi]
"So fast!"
[Taichi]
"That's your fault dammit."

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu Taichi!"

Kiri's aim settles on me.

[Taichi]
"You're about to blow up again, what even happened?"

[Kiri]
"...Kirihara-senpai, you killed her too!"
//And once again she's here, waving that thing around. Of course, she's torn on him, it's not like she knows her current weapon is not a real threat. -GHS

[Taichi]
"?!"

Touko?

[Taichi]
"Wait up, that one's..."

[Kiri]
"We went to see her, and she was dead... and you killed her!"
//No mention of the knife. Isn't it interesting? -GHS

[Taichi]
"I said I didn't know! You serious? Touko's really dead?"

[Kiri]
"Hasekura-senpai, Kirihara-senpai... who will be next?"
//~random~ kirihara->harakiri->hasekura -GHS

[Taichi]
"What happened, how did she die?"

[Kiri]
"...you know, damn you."

[Taichi]
"External wounds? Where is she?"

[Kiri]
"At Hasekura-senpai's house. In her own private room."
[Kiri]
"Her chest was pierced through with a bladed weapon..."
//No details. -GHS
[Kiri]
"You are the culprit, that is obvious."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

The hell's with that hasty conclusion---
Youko-chan's death, together with my continuing presence, had thrown Kiri into chaos.
And into excited agitation.
//Hum, that term often seen for sexual arousal... -GHS
Persuasion will likely be meaningless.
...a crossbow is a weak thing to use for intimidation,
because it cannot be fired rapidly.
One miss and it's all done.
A runner would be no simple easy thing to hit.
Subduing Kiri would simple, but,
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"I just gotta do this, do I...?"

I just can't die like this.
I put weight in the foot to lure Kiri into an accidental shot.
//See CCC3002, CCB0022/23 -GHS

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, I told you to stop!"

Miki clung to her from behind.
//No returning to the zoomed BG here. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ah!"

CIN 4 480 0 0 0
CR 0
//HACK in the bolt. -GHS
The bolt fired.
//HACK out bolt with a white flash. SFX is still later. -GHS

[Taichi]
"!?!"

The bolt flew through about thirty centimeters next to me.
Behind me, it stuck in the utensils storehouse prefab, its tail still twitching.

[Miki]
"That is just out of the question!"

[Kiri]
"But!"

[Taichi]
"...Miki, I'm thankful for you rescuing me, but, be a little more careful..."
//For the bolt above, CCC3002 again. Is that what she was doing then... or the opposite? Quite uncertain. It's possible she thought Kiri would be firing on him by then. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, soHrry."
//Oddly lisped. "Strange Drowsiness"? Well, in Taichi's case... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Stay back!"

Walking closer, I grab Kiri by the collar.

[Taichi]
"I won't do anything!"
[Taichi]
"...though I'd like to toss you off somewhere, you know."
//He totally could. Right where Yutaka fell, for example. -GHS

I let go.
Kiri falls on her backside.

[Kiri]
"...murderer!"

[Taichi]
"Wha-?"

[Miki]
"Stop it, please, both of you, let's smile!"
//See CCB0023, CCC0002. She really sucks at this. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Murderer! Who are you going to kill next?!"

[Taichi]
"...really, you, Kiri... your bad parts are showing. The point is, I just barely now learned that Touko's dead. How does it automatically become something I have done!"
//Remember 'automatic'? Also, more of what Yutaka was referring to in CCA0018B. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...who else would have done it!"

[Taichi]
"...first would be the one who found her, which would be you."

Kiri's beautiful eyebrows ruffle.

[Kiri]
"There's no way I could kill her... the only person capable of that would be someone who has lost his mind, like you!"
[Kiri]
"Die! Just make the world happy and die! If you love killing so much then kill yourself! Lunatic! Go to hell! There's just eight people... in this world... you are insane!!!"
//Yup, totally Taichi that's lost his mind. But this is possibly the fruit of all the lies from last route. And this route the lies are only increasing. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Die, just go die! Murderer! ...you're not a person!"
//HACK to sky -GHS

A grating noise that I can't bear to hear,
inviting disappointed dejection.

[Taichi]
"...not beautiful."

If the Kiri of always is nothing but a rusty knife,
this... is nothing more than an unrefined wooden log.
//The masochist is damn precise with the insolence he wants. 丸 round + 太 fat = wooden log !LOGIC! -GHS
It has no precision.
It has no subtlety.
//BTW, this means Miki's manipulations have made Kiri LESS EFFECTIVE against Taichi, not more. -GHS
How long has it been since you became so hopelessly unrecoverable, Kiri?

[Taichi]
"......"

My interest in her is vanishing, isn't it?
//See CCC3030. Uh-oh... -GHS

[Kiri]
"...your eyes... are not the eyes of a human."

She talks about my eyes.
Is this even some kind of attack?
//He's still lying to himself. Yes, it's an attack, and a damn harsh one. This is probably among the ones she uses when she "kills" him in the routes. -GHS
Yeah, it's an attack.
Should I just flip that switch, then?
Shouldn't I, now?
...if she is an enemy.
I look at Kiri.
Should I just delete this?---
//He intends on stopping to consider her as existing. Not that he'd be unjustified in wanting to really hurt her, given she's groundlessly accused him of being a murderer, threatened him with a weapon, AND she went and pressed his berserk buttons by being serious in her hatred AND talking about his looks (the thing about his eyes). Plus he's an unadmitted emotional wreck since he just can't bring himself to state it out loud how much Youko's death hurts him (same as with previous route and Touko). Nasty? perhaps; the overreaction of a psychotic murderer? Not even close. His reaction is borderline saintly compared to what most people'd have at this point. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hy..."

She has... read... me. Nice discerning eye.
In an instant she goes pale.
Humans die so simply.
There's no need for stabbing.
just, on this thin little neck here, just a bit of---
//see end of route. Prophetic, or is that self-fulfilling? Kiri has failed him for the last time... -GHS

[Miki]
"Okay okaaay, that's where it eeends! Glooomp!"
//HOLY SHIT IT'S A STAR TREK DEEP SPACE NINE REFwait that was 'gabo'. Glomp is a real English SFX according to kawaii uguu animuh webcomacks which I totally don't read because I'm like omfg teh serious translator of Japanese loli tentacle porn. -GHS

Miki flipped Kiri's skirt.

[Kiri]
"KYAAAAAH!!!"

[Taichi]
"...oh."

Appetites of the flesh reawakening!

[Taichi]
"STEEE-RIPES!"
//hate u taichi -GHS

A shout made with the proud face of an umpire that just finished reading the path of that stitched ball.
//WTF is it with baseball again? -GHS

[Taichi]
"BATTER OOOUT!!!"
//Batter = bat = dick OF COURSE -GHS
[Taichi]
"Whew, I knew it, your panties are striped!"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, he's back he's back, weeee!"

[Kiri]
"...bu-... what's with all this overfamiliarity now... dummy!"
//Oh, the tsundere tsundere'd. Always so rare here. -GHS

[Miki]
"But Senpai was becoming scary, and you were also going all weird, Kiri-chin."
[Miki]
"I just stopped this, OK?"

[Taichi]
"Hah, I shall go too, yes. I wanna investigate things out a bit... the Touko crime scene, I mean."
//HACK I don't care, I think this pose is inspired or at least suspiciously similar similar to that one Hanepin has in the Tsukihime-verse remake of Oblivion Recorder from Kara no Kyoukai in Kagetsu Tohya. Hmmm, fairies at school, was that... -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes, leave the shimapan gal to me!"
//THOSE ARE NOT SHIMAPAN THEY HAVE TO BE HORIZONTAL! HORIZONTAAAAAAL!!! IT'S OBVIOUS BECAUSE[500Kb of incoherent caps lock rant removed] -GHS

[Taichi]
"I leave her to you."

I leave the rooftop behind me.
