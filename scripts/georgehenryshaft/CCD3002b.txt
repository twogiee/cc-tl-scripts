[Taichi]
"Kiri."

Her entire body stiffens.
Slowly she turns to face.
What looks back at me are unsparing features.

[Taichi]
"'Morning."

[Kiri]
"...what is your business?"

A low voice.

[Taichi]
"Miki-kun's not around I guess?"
[Taichi]
"...she is not here."
[Taichi]
"Right."

I knew it.

[Taichi]
"She was wandering aimlessly about the shopping district. It felt like she was emotionally unstable."

[Kiri]
"Miki's...?

[Taichi]
"Could you go?"

Kiri flies out of the classroom without any other response.

[Taichi]
"Heeey, have this!"

[Kiri]
"...wha-?"

[Taichi]
"Lunch. It's what I promised Miki I'd give her."

Lies.
But without telling her that, Kiri would never accept it.

[Kiri]
"...why are you..."

[Taichi]
"Come on, hurry it up! She was crying you know."

Kiri gave one single quizzical look at me, then ran away.
Good, we're fine this is fine.
I let out a big sigh.
I expect that I will have to allot time for Kiri every single day.
On Sunday, the world will be rewound.
The day of the fresh start.
The world as it is now could be my Utopia, perhaps.
A world where a mortal wound is not fatal.
All back to what it was after one week.
Whoever I might wound, whoever I might co-depend on.
Reset.
If I get on good terms with Touko, next will be with Mimi-senpai.
//Someone just went too happy with copypasta methinks, as this makes little sense here. -GHS
And Kiri.
And Miki.
And Youko-chan, if I feel inclined to.
And Sakuraba.
...that's not gonna happen.
However,
there are possibilities there, for there is a place that is exempt from the reset.
This isn't complete opportunism.
//See Kiri, Youko routes -GHS
Therefore I---
It was last year, early Summer,
when I had my meeting with Shinkawa Yutaka.
It was a Summer of loud cicadas.

[Shinkawa]
『Okieh, I got the feeling I can work with this somehow.』

[Taichi]
"......"

Who was at fault?
I cannot blame fate nor coincidence.
//There is one alternative left still. -GHS
Either was at fault. Or possibly, we all were at fault.
Once that is conceded, the conclusions aren't that many.
