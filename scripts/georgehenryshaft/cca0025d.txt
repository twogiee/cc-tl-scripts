Ohhh yeah, leave this to me!

[Taichi]
"Senpai."

[Misato]
"...wha-at?"

[Taichi]
"Please marry me!"

So I proclaim with a raised thumb.

[Misato]
"Eheh..."

Senpai gave a smile of softness so like an angel's.

//What a pretty line. Please never show it to me again. -GHS

[Misato]
"Absolutely never!♪"

[Taichi]
"Hello, Tomoki? It's just Kurosu. I've just now confessed and been shot down by your nee-chan. Serious, I'm serious, live reporting. She's still right next to me! Hyeeh hyeh hyeh hyeh hyeh!"
//Can't source that laugh precisely, but it seems associated with the ゜∇゜ emoticon, i.e. sorta psychotic? BTW, THIS is where he loses her; THIS is where he plays the fool. -GHS

"Anywayingly anyway, depths of chest filledy full of bitter delight nau. And I'm sooo grateful for you supporting me in trying to convey my feelings!!! Rot & die!!!"
//Weirdy and twittery. Last one seems to be a 2chan meme. -GHSy

[Misato]
"That cellphone... did not the battery run out?"
//How does she know? Even the stupid iPhone won't run out of power in four damn days. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I know that, damn it all!"

I break down in tears.

[Taichi]
"Bwoooh!"

[Misato]
"He was close but..."
//From an expression that means "he wasn't on the mark, but not too far either". Close but no cigar. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Despite being aware that the intent was jocular I wondered maybe could it possibly be that this will end up happily but my so convenient expectations were so very transparent and therefore plainly turned down and that is the cause for the pain in my heart, Hulk Hogan!"

[Misato]
"But the problem lies in how you confessed with the exact timing for an absolute rejection, Hulk Hogan..."
//She just plays along. But she is correct: he did this on purpose. -GHS

[Taichi]
"LIFE HAS DARKNESS JUST ONE STEP AHEAD!!!

WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS NO ONE KNOWS!!!
ONLY IN THE PRESENT CAN ONE CONFIDE, HULKHOGAAAN!!!"
//Both literal and lateral for maximum silly. I can't find the precise wrestler, if there's one, but the adaptation is from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_(wrestler) of course. And damn if it doesn't fit almost too easily, timeline and all. In fact, it may be too good for this really crappy joke. -GHS

[Misato]
"Come now, I will give you some cucumbers with pickles, so cheer up! Also, let us stop talking like that wrestler. OK?"
//...and this is why. The original just ends with 'njaa'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Th-, the price of my love can be covered by a cucumber..."
//Nothing to do, my man, time to bat for the other team. -GHS

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, you will find a much more wonderful lover than me, I am sure."
//Because she doesn't believe herself good enough for him, all things considered. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's to cry."

The cucumber had the taste of a broken heart.
//hee hee bat -GHS
