//As also visible in CCC0013A, this whole conversation'll be about Taichi technically being his usual sarcastic dumb self (try reading this stuff off of the apparent context, especially without the music), and her taking it as creepy and sinister.

[Kiri]
"Well then."

So said Kiri cutting off my words.

[Kiri]
"Feel free to take your leave."
