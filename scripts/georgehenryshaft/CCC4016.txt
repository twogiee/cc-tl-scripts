[Taichi]
"Well then now."

Fire in the candle.
While writing in the diary, I look back on the day.
Yesterday, Youko-chan had died.
And today, Touko-chan has died.
Murder.
Who was it that killed them is unknown.
Kiri doesn't seem to be it.
Which means... one of the remaining four people, me excluded.
Among them there is one who would kill a close companion.

[Taichi]
"...this is heavy."
//You keep saying heavy, heavy... is the gravity different in the Cross World? -GHS

But I don't get it.
Nothing comes to my mind.
...the culprit has murdered two people for whatever motive.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
HACK these are always a pain to make... -GHS
Youko-chan.
Bolt wound.
In other words, she has fallen for one
of the traps.
Over a hundred there might be only one, but
it is certain that she will eventually make
a mistake.
//IOW, she's not perfect. Like he wished her to be. -GHS
Whoever set up the traps ended up killing
Youko-chan.
Whether she was the intended target, or
Youko-chan just unexpectedly fell victim,
I don't know.
//HACK and now Touko. -GHS
Touko.
Stabbed to death via dagger.
There was no evidence of struggle,
she had died as if in her sleep.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
//HACK NVL mode -GHS

The footprints in front of the hokora,
my shoes,
and, inside me, no recollection of
hanging around the hokora at all.
This isn't memory loss, either.
Someone was around there, and wearing my shoes.
Or, possibly, someone with identical shoes.
A thought crosses through me as if a shiver.
Suppose I had lost my rationality.
I could be redirecting my entire
aggressiveness towards others.
//Insert Tower of Friends. But what does redirecting his aggressiveness towards others mean to Taichi? I still don't believe all that Taichi A/B stuff means anything of what it looks like. -GHS
...I wouldn't need any motive, would I.
In the first place, of the four suspect, who
could even construct a trap that could trick
Youko-chan?
Is there someone who has some skill they've
kept secret?
//We're talking about the traps, not the killing, so this refers only to Miki. -GHS
The person that fits most convincingly
the criminal's profile...
...would be myself.
1) Somnambulism;
2) Split personality.
From the care with which the traps had
been laid, I can say 1) is not it.
Traps like that could never be laid without retained calm intelligence.
//That CR is always eliminated in the console versions, but that doesn't seem to make much sense. I suspect there was a period missing and the "typo" was fixed by erroneously joining two lines. Regardless, there's no functional difference. -GHS
Is it 2) then?
The fact that I have a split personality,
so to say.
//dat と -GHS
Certainly, with this it would be possible to
explain the reason why I have no recollections.
However... if I say so myself, it's a bit
hackneyed, seriously.
//Well, of course; it wasn't his split personality that laid the traps. A previous himself taught someone who's playing him at his game, and his split personality died in them. Not a single thing he says here is a lie. And once again, there's no denial that he has a split personality; he just calls it hackneyed. Telling no one who (s)he is, and in fact going through the entire story without ever stating it or even having any non-strongly metaphorical need for a split personality to exist, however, is far from it. -GHS
If it's gotta be like that, it'd be better
if there were two of me or something.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS

[Taichi]
"...dunno."

I conclude the diary with, "at this point in time, the specifics remain unknown."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"
//HACK away candle -GHS

I promptly extinguish the candle.
There's the sound of light footsteps outside.
I lean out the window.
//HACK to starry sky -GHS
...it's Kiri.
Nonchalantly walking around this uninhabited city.
I saw her yesterday too, didn't I.
Suspicious behavior.
Being that her hatred towards me is the real deal, I removed Kiri from the suspects from the very beginning, and yet...
Right, I wanna follow her.
On the way, I borrow a bicycle.
High efficiency pursuit.
//Taichi's insanely bad on a car, but he can ride a bike like nobody's business. He's riding the hills (see CCA0004 - he himself calls it absurdly hard!), and chasing hyper-suspicious Kiri without her noticing. -GHS
Before long, Kiri entered a field in front of a grove of trees.
//Descriptions and details keep changing, but perhaps  that's the point. -GHS
The bicycle would stand out way too much in there, so I don't use it.
//He seems to imply he has no problem riding the bike in off-road woods-like terrain. -GHS
I lower my posture and steal up quietly.
//No more "kill my presence"? -GHS
Kiri takes 'it' out from the package.
A crossbow---
It was absolutely not a toy.
Coming into possession of that in this country means to have a weapon of power without compare.
It is not capable of rapid fire, but,
it has its edge in quietness, and is rich in destructive power.
Kiri pulls the trigger.
A bolt pierced a withered old tree.
The sound of slashed air remains in the ears.
Kiri nocks a new bolt.
She completes the load via the crank cocking aid.
Awkwardly.
But... I knew:
This is practice.
For combat.
Well then, who with?
Who with... indeed...
It's as if a dark, wicked aura is coming from Kiri.
Her eyes had lost emotion.
Mechanical motions.
//She went Automatic. -GHS
Whether she hits or whether she misses, the expression on her face does not change.
//HACK Kiri zoomed -GHS

[Kiri]
『I'm saying, why are you acting all friendly?!』
[Kiri]
『...who would ever do anything of the sort to you!!!』
[Kiri]
『Murderer! Who are you going to kill next?!』
//HACK back -GHS

Mysteries still abound as far as what happened to both Youko-chan and Touko.
However,
as far as Kiri's motive is concerned, I seem to have altogether too much understanding.
She continued to practice for about an hour.
Perhaps exhausted after steeling herself for so long, she sluggishly cleans up after herself, and withdraws.
Coming out into the open space, I examine around the timber that was turned target.
//Hmmm, odd change. Might just be an older revision. -GHS
I return home.
I felt really fatigued mentally...
Sakuraba was there.

[Taichi]
"...the hell!"

Kick in the ass.

[Sakuraba]
"Ohhh, Taichi."

Sakuraba was eating Tomoki's cucumber,
fresh from his supply drop.
//No, seriously, that literally also says "a cucumber put in by Tomoki". Edited for more Fujoshi Appeal. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well?"

[Sakuraba]
"Listen here."

[Taichi]
"What now?"

[Sakuraba]
"I got sick of curry bread."

[Taichi]
"...listen here now."

[Sakuraba]
"Therefore I came to your house, because aren't there cucumbers here."
//fnarr, fnarr goes here, however. Indeed there's a cucumber here; one brought by Tomoki, the other's in Taichi's Biological Tent. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And why did you come to my house for that!"

[Sakuraba]
"I seem to have told Tomoki that I would not need food."

[Taichi]
"Wh-, why even?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because I had curry bread."

Ad hoc living, his.

[Taichi]
"Fine, still, what's that hyper ginormous bag?"

[Sakuraba]
"Ah. I'm going on a journey."

[Taichi]
"............yer doin' what?"
//lisp??? -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Journey."

[Taichi]
"You... when things're like this... you're indulging in the act of Traveling?"

[Sakuraba]
"Indeed. Journeys are good."

Sakuraba was way off in a world of his own.
//...a world called Reality? -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"In these times journeys are necessary, don't you think so?"

[Taichi]
"But I think that staying still..."

[Sakuraba]
"Mine is reversal thinking."
//Design perspective again? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is-, is it now!"

To dare... to dare to go on a journey.
//Ohhh, it was like, like that famous anime, that hideously badly written and overwrought one about moe harems with characters that had no personality and visuals that were like having a cattle prod taken to the visual cortex, but with some crap about the supernatural tossed in to delude idiots that it was actually deep or meaningful, what was it called... Da Capo 3, I think. -GHS
Sakuraba looked like he was on the winner's side.
//COUGH COUGH COUGH -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"And so, I want to get part of the food from you."

[Taichi]
"...well that's not a problem, though."
//Mat 7:7-10 -GHS

We take food out of the Tomoki-bako (the supply drop cardboard box) and we sort it out.
//Complete Box, Yume Bako, Kizuna Bako... now there's the Tomoki Bako. It's all about the Tsuki-bako I tell you. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, where ya going?"
//btw they took the cucumbers that Tomoki laid in for them out of Tomoki's Box, and they split it between them. There are no words. Well, no, there are seven words: this is obviously a gay sex metaphor. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Haven't decided. I'll get to the next town over, then think it over again."
[Sakuraba]
"Besides it could even be that I'll meet people there."
//Indeed he will. Indeed he will. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."

That just means he hasn't thought through this at all, doesn't it.

[Taichi]
"Bring hAndy (not just the Capp, the radio as well) with you. It doesn't look like there's radio waves anywhere, but maybe you'll catch some."
//ハンディ is also short for handicap. Anthropomorphized because Sakuraba is as Yutaka. And also Taichi thinks him retarded. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Yah, packed it."

[Taichi]
"It's an SSB, right? Say, just in case, you can borrow an antenna that broadcast overseas, wait a while."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation The rest is about the crap he's about to give him. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Thanks, then."

As one who engages in Wacchi, I had just a smidgen of knowledge 'bout radio monitoring.
//See CCA0018 (as remade). -GHS
This is a Hyper Long Distance Telecommunication Antenna, built with disposable wooden chopsticks and nichrome wire.
//Google the wire type if you don't know it for extra lols. It's basically a brick. Now, maybe he's just trolling him, as usual, but... what if he actually thinks it'd work? I mean, he DID make it or something. -GHS
That is what I went to grab.

[Taichi]
"Catch."

[Sakuraba]
"Ah, thanks. I can chat all fluent with foreigners with this one."

[Taichi]
"HA! HA! HA! If only your words were understandable! It is most unfortunate, Sakuraba, you bastard, but your knowledge of---"

[Sakuraba]
"(...)"
//The only better way to translate this would be to find some way to add furigana. ...oddly he sounds sorta-french-ish here, and so does the new actor. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...EH?"

[Sakuraba]
"(...)"
//He's also obviously reading from some phrasebook. The new actor isn't even trying on this, he sounds "what! fiasco! it is." -GHS

[Taichi]
"...MAJI?" (Seriously?)
//Me-sama in the middle of status of being awesome maybe probably? -GHS

Uhm, that's even less English, isn't it.
//HACK closed-eyes Sack -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Well, as long as it's English I'll get something done."
[Sakuraba]
"...I have lived in America long ago, I can speak a little."

What!
This idiot... you're kidding me... he's a Casual Bilingual!
//Not that uncommon. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes, truth is I'm much better with Russian, yes!"

[Sakuraba]
"Right."
//HACK no need -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"If there's Russians I'll leave them to you."
//See CCC4001 (you had to remember that one for this to make sense in the original). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ha, hahahah, well do your best, and wh-, when are you coming back?"
//Now he's his mom -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"When I want to come back."

I see.

[Sakuraba]
"And, I borrowed some money from you have I."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh a bit yes."

[Sakuraba]
"How much was it even?"

Even if money's meaningless now, really.
So weird, this guy.

[Taichi]
"Dunno, I have nooo memory of how much."
//Greedy bastard. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"For now I'm handing over my coin purse."

He takes out his wallet.
I take it from him.
There's a jingle-jingle sound.

[Taichi]
"Hahah, looks like Mister Bilingual has moments of poverty too, eh."
//HACK moved doll change here -GHS

Sakuraba smiled peacefully.

[Sakuraba]
"Well yeah. You can call me rich, but it's like that."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah."

[Sakuraba]
"Hahah!"

/笑い合う。
An exchange of laughs,
thump, arms are crossed,
and friendship was deepened.

[Taichi]
"Well now well now, how many have you got in here?"

I open the wallet.
Sure enough, there was no paper money inside.
Inside there were fifteen gold coins, ten thousand yen each.
//HACK to black. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mister Yeeen!!!"

Swooned.

[Sakuraba]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Hyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyhhh!!!"

I thrashed around like a caterpillar.
The hell's this walleeet!
First time I see something this impossibleee!
Looking closely, they weren't only ten thousand yen gold coins.
//HACK NVL mode. -GHS
 8 x 100,000 yen gold coins commemorating the
60th year of the Showa Emperor on the Throne.
 7 x 100,000 yen gold coins commemorating the
enthronement of the Emperor.
 2 x 50,000 yen gold coins commemorating the
Wedding of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.
 4 x 5,000 yen silver coins commemorating the
International Garden and Greenery Exposition.
 3 x 5,000 yen silver coins commemorating the
Wedding of the Crown Prince.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
All these and no more.
//HACK back to Sakuraba -GHS

[Taichi]
"You stupid or something!"

[Sakuraba]
"I couldn't really use them to do shopping."

[Taichi]
"Well, obviously!"

This guy... this much money and so readily...
Could it be that, when it comes to money, inside Sakuraba's head... 100,000 yen are not much... not much.. not much...? (echo)

[Taichi]
"But?"

If, before the Fall of Mankind, in the times when money still had significance, I had only just once extorted him some money...

[Taichi]
"oUUoUUoUUoUU!"

[Sakuraba]
"Why crying?"
//another /* missing -GHS

[Taichi]
"OOOOOOooooh!"

God exists as my personal bully!
That was the earnest regret spree of mine.

[Sakuraba]
"And, I'll be supplementing the amount that's missing with this."

He takes out a wooden box from the bag.
All around its sides are drawn with old-fashioned landscapes, Shan Shui style.
//Seems to run through the sides of the box. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_shui -GHS

[Taichi]
"This'd be?"

[Sakuraba]
"I picked one that looks adequately expensive."

[Taichi]
"Author... uhmmm... there's an expert certification. A certain Assumed Tensho Shubun-san?"
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensh%C5%8D_Sh%C5%ABbun this one I had to cross-reference Wikipedia in English and Japanese to figure out; 伝 intermediary for "assumed XXX" is not really a common meaning. And there's the kanji 筆 for 'brush' after the actual name (周文 shubun) that's confusing. It simply means "attributed to the brush of". -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Is he famous?"

[Taichi]
"I'll look him up."
//HACK wipe to black -GHS

I bring over an illustrated book on the topic from Mutsumi-san's room.
//HACK wipe back -GHS

[Taichi]
"If it's a cheap one it shouldn't be published in here I guess."

[Sakuraba]
"That would be a problem. 'Cause this is the one that looks the most expensive."

[Taichi]
"Oh Assumed-san, how much have you been straining yourself down on this Earth of ours?"
//A bit sing-y. Taichi's assuming that the first two kanjis are the surname of the author. -GHS

National Treasure and Important Cultural Property.

[Taichi]
"------------"

Loss of consciousness.

[Sakuraba]
"Ohi, Taichi! Taichi!"

............

[Taichi]
"You... this is the real deal... isn't what you're doing an affront to the Country?"

[Sakuraba]
"Is it? I thought this was only good as fuel for a fire."
//Of course. He may carry their patriotic currency, but he doesn't put his treasures in anything of this world. -GHS

Destroyer of Culture... this guy is nothing but a Destroyer of the Cultuuure!
//Compare Touko, 芸術の破壊者 Destroyer of Arts -GHS
I was just shaking like a little kitten.
//PCP CCB0002, CCC3022 for reasons unclear -GHS
And while shaking, all of a sudden Sakuraba said,

[Sakuraba]
"By the way... why don't you come together with me?"
//Oh, don't worry, Sack, he'll come too when his time is done. Uhm, let's just not bother with subtlety here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh... me, traveling with you?"

[Sakuraba]
"I invited Tomoki too though. Seems like that guy has something to do here."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh well."

[Sakuraba]
"How 'bout?"

[Taichi]
"...seems interesting, but."

Everybody's faces run by me,
together with the many mysteries.
//Until the mysteries are solved, he'll stay. If there were no more mysteries, he'd just leave. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I best pass."

[Sakuraba]
"Well then."

Doesn't seem like you're that disappointed, Sakuraba.
//...because he knows... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"With that, I should go."

[Taichi]
"At least do this tomorrow! Isn't crossing the mountain dangerous?"

[Sakuraba]
"I feel like going now."

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, you're the type that'll just get stranded."
//See CCA0002, same term. This idiot can find the way. Hooo boy can he. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Then, I will be taking my part of the food, and will be going."

[Taichi]
"Yep."
//HACK disable doll -GHS

I see him off.

[Taichi]
"Ah, right, can I ask you something?"
//HACK fade doll. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"You, do you got someone in the Broadcast Club you hate so much you'd kill?"

[Sakuraba]
"No one. I really like everybody."

[Taichi]
"Just going all out aren't you."

[Sakuraba]
"That's not what I mean. I have a mental incompetency, so I don't have desires of that kind."
//Vs. want. -GHS

That is indeed the truth.

[Sakuraba]
"You stole my sexual desire, that day, that time, and that's how it's still is."

And he looks happy.

[Taichi]
"That's disgusting so cut it out."

[Sakuraba]
"Nah, being without strong sexual desires is for the best for a spontaneous human like me."
//This is sort of what makes Sakuraba a "fixed" Taichi. If your ears give you scandal, best to go without them, after all. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"What I want to do I just do, outside of that."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

On the day Sakuraba's eardrum broke, that very day,
this guy calmed down in a way that would sound almost like a lie.
//Very literally like one. -GHS
And, at the same time, his sexual desires also vanished.
What caused that? Unknown.
Maybe the hard blow of a broken heart, maybe the achievement of enlightenment.
//Yes. -GHS
What it was Sakuraba doesn't understand either.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Taichi]
"One more question."
[Taichi]
"Have you ever murdered anyone?"

[Sakuraba]
"No, I haven't."
//Dunno, I think English is still hurting from that thing above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...right then."
[Taichi]
"Got it. See you later."

[Sakuraba]
"Yeah, bye then..."

I think, as I see him off,
that if this guy were to the culprit, then I have juuust let him escape from under my nose.
But, ah, it should be fine.
I'm probably wrong.
And so it was,
that Sakuraba was no longer among us.
He just plainly... disappeared.
//HACK new line. Ohh, reminds very much of CCC3004. -GHS
