IF $loop == 0 JMP NORM
//This is one of three scripts that works both normal and sepia, for week 1 and week 2 and next. Implementation is simple: it checks whether $loop (which was originally $roop, natch) is zero or non-zero, latter meaning it's not first week, and loads the appropriate stuff. Flashback opening is skipped on same grounds. Of course, I had to dupe all the lines due to changing tags, but at least the stuff isn't on separate files. This saves 120 copypasta lines. -GHS
JMP SCENE
:NORM
//Week 1 is the ONLY time when this particular cicadas sound is called. -GHS
JMP SCENE
:SCENE
It may have become evening, but the ground was still hot.
The heat reports through the soles of the shoes,
but it's not something unbearable.
Compared to a city center in the Kanto region, there's gonna be a world of difference.
//Implication that we're not there, as well as BETRAYAL: despite being much earlier in Summer, there's relatively low heat due to the world as if it was just about September. -GHS
The passing breeze is nice, so that the humidity doesn't pervade either.
If only there weren't so many of these slopes to pass over, that is.
The loudness of the cry of the cicadas further amplifies the heat.
In the style of certain bands, active only in the Summer, those guys bet their everything on this season.
//Not sure if that's supposed to be a specific reference. -GHS
IF $loop == 0 Boy: "Gyah!"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

Nearby, someone collapsed.
//He's spotted Taichi and repeating his last memory with him. -GHS
There was a dry sound, and a stainless steel crutch tumbled at his foot.

[Taichi]
"Oh deary?"
//Girly. Meaning Taichi's switching to girl mannerism. Meaning he has already recognized Yutaka. -GHS

A person had fallen down.
I try to approach.

[Taichi]
"...uhm, you alright?"

IF $loop == 0 Boy: "Ah, thanks. I'm alright."
IF $loop != 0 Shinkawa: "Ah, thanks. I'm alright."
At times like this, the Japanese immediately say 'I'm alright, I'm alright',
//Nations of the World. -GHS
and who knows how they actually are.
//This isn't as unsubtle as the Psychoman thing, but it's certainly no ringing endorsement of this typically Japanese behavior either. -GHS
I'm abruptly furious.
//Out of who the guy is, not because of his behavior. ...or is it? -GHS

[Taichi]
"You really alright here?! You think I can tell if you're actually alright when you blurt it out that quickly?!"

IF $loop == 0 Boy: "Oh, OhOh... AhAhAh..."
IF $loop != 0 Shinkawa: "Oh, OhOh... AhAhAh..."
//Nod punctuation I guess -GHS
The Japanese was overwhelmed and nodded unsteadily.

[Taichi]
"You could even have a compound fracture, who knows!"

And the fellow stood up with a bitter smile.

[Taichi]
"It's my fault, we're good."
//Technically "ah, thank you" and "no problem", but given the subtext is anything but that, hyperliteral. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Injuries?"

IF $loop == 0 Boy: "Doesn't look like any."
IF $loop != 0 Shinkawa: "Doesn't look like any."
//See above: this isn't a duplicate, they weren't talking about THIS incident above. -GHS
Using the crutches, he finds some balance.
Disability in one leg then...
//If your right hand causes you to stumble... it's even doubly ironic, given he just stumbled. -GHS

"Bone fracture?"

His face was peaceful in its worryless laugh.
//One could say... it's the toughest of them? -GHS
It was the face of a human that had been through hardship.

//Did he recognize his hair? But he didn't have it back when he knew it. The alternative explanation is that he recognized his face, but had difficulties not so much because of his clothes, but because of his hair being different. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, this?"

I pinched up a bit of my hair.

[Taichi]
"It's not a wig ya know."

IF $loop == 0 Boy: "Ain't it all white."
IF $loop != 0 Shinkawa: "Ain't it all white."
//Because white = doIhavetosaythiscmon -GHS
It certainly is.
The hair on my head has been white for a very long while now.
//Not necessarily from birth, however. In fact, keep that ずっと前 zutto mae in mind for this script, although it'll be replaced in eg CCC3003. Probably because this is much earlier in Taichi's life than that script. -GHS
A fuzzy-like white, a certain somebody once called it.
//Going by GIS, 綿毛 basically means "like a dandelion". And by basically I mean "holy crap that's ONLY pictures of dandelions here". Could've been anyone who said it: the girls who made him Living Doll, or just Misato. Likely latter, but still ambiguous. -GHS
It's not the white that comes with age,
it's a snow-white mane that kept its luster,
//Art director: "So, [possibly Tanaka's real name]-san, it's fine if Taichi's hair is just dark greyish, right? Right, of course it is, here, it's all done!" -GHS
Hair so naturally white it is uncanny and eerie.
...that's reason number one I catch people's eyes.
//Implying that the girls at the Mansion would've caught this... -GHS
Reason number two it's how girly my face naturally looks. Dammit.
//...when they actually caught this. -GHS
IF $loop == 0 Boy: "Ah, my bad. That bothers you, right."
IF $loop != 0 Shinkawa: "Ah, my bad. That bothers you, right."
But this guy's a nice guy.
He knows consideration for others.
Therefore, I'll be considerate as well.
//Interesting that 気配 kihai, on itself, means sign/presence/indication, and it's often used with Youko. -GHS

"Naah, no prob'."

And the guy gave me a broad smile.

[Taichi]
"Oh, how old are you?"

The Japanese stated his date of birth.
Same year as me.
And then, a close friend, maybe.
//Many many many meanings. -GHS

//Since Taichi is the masochist, what he actually means is easy to tell; even more so considering the joke he just made wasn't entirely at his expense. Taichi, after all, took it sorta seriously. -GHS

This is the introduction of a man that I can't be negligent about.
