The new school term starts today.
//HACK back to ADV mode -GHS
As waking up in a house with no female presence means the process of Wake Up → Go to School is wholly devoid of that moe factor, I lightly exit to outside without following each thought one by one.
//"The boring parts were removed". Ironic, giving the very next script. This should remind of CCZAS, particularly. -GHS
Commuting to school after a month and a half.
//Meaning vacation begins around mid-July, consistent with the 1771 days. -GHS
Weather was nice.
It's still the beginning of September, but it's not excessively hot.
My bangs hung hazily in front of my eyelids.
That's the only slight discomfort.

[Taichi]
"Awww, and I wanted to cut 'em..."
//Implication that there's no barbers anymore. Odd, since this is a dream... is it? -GHS

How gloomy.
I don't really like my hair, although it's a bit the color's fault.

[Taichi]
"Sigh..."

I began on the road to school as I played with my bangs.
Trudging along.
Should I get someone cut them for me sometime?
//Possibly Youko, but see CCB2016, Touko will suggest it. -GHS
Yeah, I'll do that.

[Girl]
"Oi there!"
//Notice the sequence: 1) hello -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yo there."

A girl riding a bike lined up next to me with quite natural timing.
She lines up to me with an unsteady yet skilfully kept balance.
That's not something that falls easily to walking speeds.
The type of bike seems to come with a very high price.
It's well suited to a girl that seems to be so lively.

[Girl]
"Yott'oh!"

She makes display of a little wheelie.
Ah, I saw her panties.
//2) Reset temporary cache -GHS
White. Way too white.
Pure white.
Yep, pure white is so goood. So awesooome.
//Starting to sound out of it. -GHS
I wanna see mooore.
Ah, I can't see them anymore, no.
//Those little affectations at the end of sentences are generally irrelevant, except with the Curse of Mikaka, see CCZAS: や ya is 7. -GHS
Dammit.

[Girl]
"Say, Taicchan, you ever been to the forest heart of the mountain?"
//Despite being written with "rear" and "mountain", "urayama" is not the other side of the mountain, it's the part of the mountain less exposed to light. (Or the mountain behind one's house, but Taichi's house is nowhere near the hokora, despite how in CCZAS... but never mind.) Adapting a bit because "darker parts of the mountain" sounds kinda silly. -GHS

This girl whose one thin scrap of cloth so magnificently tickled my male spirits turned just her head towards me.

[Taichi]
"I have. We were having club training camp up until recently."
//This is a very weird way to say "until yesterday", which suggests something is off with his sense of time right here. -GHS

[Girl]
"On your Summer Break?"

[Taichi]
"Yep."
//How does she not know and why is he unsurprised by this? -GHS

[Girl]
"...uhhh-huh, maybe that's why."

[Taichi]
"That's why, what?"
//Guessing it's intended to be (mis)read as him having stumbled into the Parallel World there. The real meaning is very different: that was likely when he decided to keep the diaries in the hokora and begin forgetting everything between weeks. -GHS

[Girl]
"Nah, it's just that in that area, there's a god there y'know."
//3) religious discussion. Keeping it minuscle just because it's the first time, but there's technically no reason to. -GHS

Our two gazes locked for a brief moment.
Then suddenly and simultaneously,
//HACK Nanaka zoomed 1 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahah!"
//HACK Nanaka zoomed 2 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahahahahahahah!"
//HACK clock dissolve. -GHS
[Girl]
"He's got this amazing graciousness, y'know."
//This should be where the "Tender Grace" music takes its name, but it doesn't quite work here. I'll put it later. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I wish you wouldn't just go on like nothing happened."
//Sentences ending in "youni" are typical of Nanaka, there's even more in the censored scenes in the console version. -GHS

[Girl]
"Naaah, wanting to ridicule it is totally natural. If some guy saidd'at to me with a really straight face I'd laugh too."
//Said + that. The actress sounds like she's stumbling on that one. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Therefore you just said that to me with a straight face to make me laugh, have you."

[Girl]
"Right, but... this is still sort of a serious thing, this is."
//He won't listen to it, though. Few do. So she changes away from explicit references. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The god?"

[Girl]
"Yep."

[Taichi]
"The kind of thing that in English you'd spell G-O-D?"
//While the Kami in Japan can refer to spirit, in the west "God" is implicitly the Christian one. This is another unsubtle implication that the reference is purely Christian. -GHS

Our two gazes locked for a brief moment.
//HACK Nanaka zoomed 1 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahah!"
//HACK Nanaka zoomed 2 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wahahahahahahahahahahah!"

[Girl]
"Ahahahahahahahahahahah!"
//HACK clock dissolve -GHS
[Girl]
"...we're talking in circles now (sob)."
//This one's an adaptation, I admit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"There, there, I'll listen to you then. So, what's it all about with this god? In the first place, which god are we talking about?"

[Girl]
"Ahhh, that, Nanaka-san doesn't know either, no."
//Nana ka, the literal question "seven?". This may be a "doesn't care" more than a literal doesn't know, but she may also not know exactly what God's all about - she answers his first question alone, see CCC0045A. It's a Biblically correct answer. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wha-...?!"

In that instant, I knew, instinctively.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, grand discovery! If you write the name "Nanaka" in hiragana instead of the kanji for "seven" and "scent", it's way more moe, isn't it?!"
//The revelation SHOULD be that he recognizes her as his mother, but it's blocked up by Moe Crap(tm). Still, Taichi seems to know how her name is written, which is very odd: either he knows, or he read the screen. Pick your interpretation, really. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Knew it."
//More like a "whatevs", but will become literal in CCB0002, and furthering the confusion on that 'know' above. And it won't be the first time. -GHS

So she says all nonchalant.
Doesn't seem to be the type that flinches in front of sudden swerves in the train of conversation.
//Taichi likes to destabilize people with this. It's a pretty common tactic, if an annoying and ultimately cowardly one -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ahem, there's a hokora there. Ho-ko-ra!"
//That ahem could use more 'R's but except for 'arrr' I can't think of anything. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Writing 'hokora' in Katakana makes it sound like some incredibly epidemic disease, doesn't it."
//See CCX0001. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ahem! There's a hokora there! HO-KO-RA!"
//Technically copypasta, but since she's angrier... -GHS

Even the second time she seems to have no interested in switching to my track.
//(Train) riding metaphor, continued. She can't switch track; she's wise to his tricks, and she's a memory. She can't hear him. It's amazing she can do this much. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Is it on the side of the mountain trail?"

[Nanaka]
"Yeppy yep!"
//Making these mannerisms stand out as much as possible, because Taichi will be blurting them out copypasta-like at the most unexpected moments. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Hop!"

Once more the bike popped a wheelie, and this time also a big bunny-hop with the rear wheel.
//Wheelie+rear-wheel hop. -GHS
It may be out of the context of our talks, but that's still quite an expert trick.

[Taichi]
"Gorgicious"

* Going Suzui! (Gorgeous) + Delicious
//Speaking of out of context, it's a reference to this Hokkaido broadcast: http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/GO%E3%83%BBI%E3%83%BBS this may be nothing, or it may be more, it's also mentioned elsewhere, see CCZRooftop. Unfortunately there's no way to make this google, sorry but there's nothing on this in English that I can find at all. Let's go with just weird. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Innit!"

With a triumphant smile.
Just between you and me, that's quite charming.

[Nanaka]
"The god of the Hokora is super gorgicious you know."
[Nanaka]
"They say even if we have a nuclear war, his tender grace is so great that it will totally protect you."

[Taichi]
"All lieees."
//Literal because Higurashi reference. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Even if a cancer insurance gave all it had, it's still powerless in front of cancer!"
//See CCD5001. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"No, yer slipping off of the point."
//The point being that even if you were to die, being in this God's graces would mean you don't actually die. Life after death, even after the end of the world. This is more Christianity. It's interesting to remember the time period in which Narnia takes place: as London was being bombed during WWII. Of course, back then Hitler was a present threat, but here in these eternal late '90s, nuclear war hits closer. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The god of the 21st century ought be much more minimalist and furthermore given to pin-point accuracy!"
//Randomly formal (it'll keep happening) -GHS
[Taichi]
"A god who'll snitch to you with a message on your cellphone when your girlfriend two-times you with a guy cooler than you and is about to have a sexual relationship with him."
//That's not God, that's a frickin' PI. I wonder if there's an anti-calvinist/omnidirigist diatribe buried around here somewhere. The writing on this sentence is particularly and unnecessarily convoluted, and it begins to be evident even in English how overwrought this first week is. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"A society with a sense of entitlement so refined that it can assert to something so specific has to be on its death throes."
//See CCC3025 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Japan is calmly mad, that's why."
//One of the few explicit references to Japan, oddly enough. Reminder that the disappearance of mankind is also the demographic decline of Japan. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"S'yah!"

This time she made the bike stand on the front wheel.
//Not sure if one can use "front wheel standie", especially since the term is 'stoppie'. -GHS
This one's astonishing.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, that bike's amazing!"
//Speaking explicitly of God isn't working, so she's resetting the conversation and trying something else. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"The bike, he says..."

[Taichi]
"Lemme ride it, lemme ride it!"

[Nanaka]
"Nooo way. Amateurs rejected!"
//It's not because her bike doesn't exist; it's because Taichi is still alive, and will therefore be an amateur due to what the bikes signify. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Meanie!"

[Nanaka]
"Some time ago, dad helped himself to a ride without permission too."
//She's speaking third person as parents often do; she means Taichi's father, not hers. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"And then he came back all hurt after a fall."
[Nanaka]
"Ohhh what a big fight we had, us two!"
[Nanaka]
"He acted alll innocent when I asked him 'bout those scrapes."

[Taichi]
"...papa's a big fuss as well."
//See CCX0001, that's what he uses for his father there too. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"That's what mom always says."
//Can be read as "he told mother", but also "mother told him", keeping the ambiguity between who is this 'mom'. Since the term also means "used to say", splitting the difference and going with this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What a demon!"
//Might refer to either. Or Miki, see CCC4003. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Daddy got his allowance cut for three months he did."
//"Yanno"? Did Tanaka actually want her say "yannow"? -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's the flow of simple emotions that reminds of the national ideal of a family."
//"That sounds like a stereotype out of some advertisement". -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Just around that time, daddy played a prank on a coworker's PC via the network... he went to use a program to automatically create folders labeled with swearwords to fill this guy's public folder with bad language!"
//Network, not Internet. This would've been the late '80s. Odd she'd use folder instead of directory, but I'm not privy to '80s Japanese supposing-DOS lingo. And I suspect neither is Taichi, which is why she'll talk about Windows and IE later on. -GHS

An adult child that guy...

[Nanaka]
"But when he went to do it he got his target wrong, and he filled his superior's computer with swearwords!"

[Taichi]
"Waaahahahahaha!"

[Girl]
"Aaahahahahaha!"

And these idiots had a child.
//Lit. "this guy's parents are idiots", but it's ambiguous whose parents it would be naturally. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"And because of that, he also got a salary cut for three months. Oh how mom blew up a laugh!"

[Taichi]
"...the world would be in harmony if all families were like that."

[Nanaka]
"Well, they aren't anymore."
//Ambiguous on what: his family (true, both are dead), or all families (no one exists). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh?"
//Also "Where did they go" (if you squint). -GHS

Thwink,
the bike made a wheelie again.
Ah, I saw her panties!
Rediscovery!

[Nanaka]
"Y'ott'o!"
//HACK panty focus Nanaka -GHS

I saw them again, ah, aaah!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
//あx14 -GHS
SnowWhiteSnowWhiteSnowWhiteSnowWhite!!!
CamelToeCamelToeCamelToe!!!
//Also "devour whole", but it's not much of foreshadowing lost. 4xSnowWhite + 3xCamelToe/DevourWhole -GHS
Praiseworthy peach-pink siiigh!!!!
//HACK :-( -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh."

I kneeled.
//This stuff is more serious to him than blood. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"...that was bad right then, my intellect sorta descended down way low..."
//Intellect amount went down + his brain in his trousers -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ahhh, it's your intellect that's unstable, is it?"
//Tiiinge of sarcasm there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Doesn't it at times feel good when you're saddling with a sad'O?"
//サドル saddle +サドる be sadistic, particularly appropriate considering that Taichi is (supposedly) an M, see Yutaka. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"What?"

[Taichi]
"It's nothing... do forget it."

At last my rationality came back.
I'm just so vulnerable to unforeseen erotic events.
I stand.

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's go to school."

[Nanaka]
"Why are you slouching there?"

[Taichi]
"...you're asking that with the pure tone of a little girl?"

[Nanaka]
"?"

[Taichi]
"Other than it is due to a spatial problem concerning my extreme lowermosts, I cannot comment."

[Nanaka]
"Your groin hurts, is that it."

[Taichi]
"Really, an oboko like you..."
//Innocent, naive, and also virgin. Which is extremely ironic. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Oboko... what's that?"
//http://ejje.weblio.jp/content/%E3%81%8A%E3%81%BC%E3%81%93 virgin, but look at the other meanings. -GHS

[Taichi]
"My groin hurts, that's it."
//Callback. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ohhh."

Great, swindled.

[Nanaka]
"Take some care theeere! The safety of the offspring seems at risk!"
//"Your balls are getting chafed in your pants" + "my son's in pain", where "son" is also an euphemism for dick, ergo Nanaka is futanari?????? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's make some offspriiiing!"

[Nanaka]
"A guy disgustingly honest with his desires, are you."
//Vs. want, see CCA0021 -GHS

[Taichi]
"...my true motives come out when I'm taken by surprise."
//See CCE0001, when Misato does so to him: it's how he fakes it. But underneath this mess of OMFG HARD KANJI's, there's also truth. -GHS

All the same, I wanted to take back that one right then.
//And instead... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Any sort of man, when he sees a cute girl, would see his desire toweringly rise its head, as assuredly as when you shout Red Snake C'mon!"
//...he doubles down. Moron. Still vs. want. Either this is the reference, or it's a reference to whatever this is a reference too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcYBdaoAVY8 Warning, near-toxic level of Japanese WITIDE. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And it's all a 'red snake, c'mon!' with you!"
[Taichi]
"Ah, but usually it's the green snake, so you're safe, OK?"
//Switched because in Japan blue = green -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Is there a huggy y-ero-w snake between them?"
//I'm sure the girl who gave Taichi most of his sexual perversions would never ever use that 'ero' inside the Japanese spelling of 'yellow' intentionally. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yes, what you'd call a half-erec---"

So I said, and became uneasy all on my own.
Timidly timidly I turned around.

[Taichi]
"...disgusted?"
//See level of lust remark above. -GHS

Nanaka laughed with a sweet smile.

[Nanaka]
"Nh-nh, I'm happy."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaka]
"C'mon, c'mon! Walk, walk!"
//See CCD4003 -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Until that erectile tissue goes nighty-night, I'll be riding behind you, OK?"
//Baby talk, literally. He had erections all the way back then, I suppose. Erectile undisfunction? -GHS

[Taichi]
"You noticed that from the start, dinn'cha, you nun..."
//Also "bitch", yes, but Taichi is more of a wannabe motherfucker than a son of a bitch. Plus it's funnier that he keeps calling his mother a virgin. Also, technically nun fits closer given everything. -GHS

I suffered a deep wound of depth reminiscent to Sakuraba's with his bicycle affair.
//Which is true, since he also had an accident that perhaps got him to change his hair color as a consequence of having to part from his mother. It's actually a decontextualized random interjection and not a consequence from the above. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ohhhhh, the schoool, it has come into vieeew!♪"
//♪♪♪ -GHS
[Nanaka]
"So white isn't iiit, so new isn't iiit, so expensive isn't iiit!"

[Taichi]
"Want to transfer in?"
[Taichi]
"Right now, you can get admitted same day as request, no entrance test required!"
//No one to administer it, no one to stop her since she doesn't exist. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"And the uniform?"

[Taichi]
"This, this harmless young boy will arrange it-it-it-it-it-it!"
//Technically "arrange it for you", but then the repetition would sound like "yu-yu-yu", and that's a thing here. Cross Channel. He likely could: he would've gotten Youko's somewhere. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...heh, it's an uniform with round holes cut 'round the height of the chest, r-i-g-h-t?"

[Taichi]
"Hyyy, I will not do such beastly things?!"
//Joke's cookie-cutter writing, so it gets an appropriately bad adaptation. 'Beast', specific term, will return. Though in this case it's intended to sound nukige-like, as in, nukige-like uniforms. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...merely, ah, the skirt size is, hum, a thing about three centimeters shorter than the normal measure, nothing to do about it... ah, uhm, if for you that's alright-ait-ait-ait..."
//Originally ra-ra-ra, see CCZAS. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"This sexual harassment's got no bite..."
//It's a little puni. -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Well then, it's about time for me to get going."

The bike abruptly spun around. On a dime.
This girl's motor skills were quite the thing.
//Of course. Motor skills is written 運動神経, 運動 movement 神 god 経 experience. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Young boy, that thing about the hokora up the mountain, that's all true."

[Taichi]
"...eh?"

I wasn't quite able to understand the meaning of her words.
//"Maestro, il senso lor m'e' duro." -GHS

[Nanaka]
"If you get totally stuck... please go there."
//She can do nothing but point at the truth; he'll have to go there. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh, huh..."

Her face clouds without warning.

[Nanaka]
"But even if I tell you this, nothing at all will ever change, that's what."
//"How long do I have to put up with you fools?" is Jesus in a nutshell. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nanaka..."
//He DEFINITELY knows her kanjis here. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Whoopsie, this turned all gloomy didn't it, that ain't gonna go!"

She spun around on the spot with a wheelie.
And when she had spun around completely once, she was smiling again.
//See CCA0002, sort of what Sakuraba does. Is that what dangerous people do? Perhaps. But also what people capable of forgiving do. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Byez now!♪"
//Ugh, unlistenable moe affectations... -GHS

Waving bundled up fingertips with magnificence,
the girl put her toes to the pedals.
//HACK sky -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, I have one question."

To her departing back.

[Nanaka]
"Whaaat?

[Taichi]
"How is it that this was the first time we've met, but you knew my name?"

[Nanaka]
"Hum. To answer that question..."

A white fingertip shot out, pointed at me.
No, at something behind me.
//HACK back to school BG -GHS
Turning around, my field of vision was captured by the school for several moments.
//...and it goes through the school, at well. -GHS
No answers there.
My gaze returned to Nanaka.
The girl had vanished,
along with her bike.
Not a Phenomenon that's going to be settled quickly.
//See CCC3017, CCD0021, CCX0001... this is all but a warning that we're in for the long haul. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......mother of...?"
//"Oya" is an absolutely normal exclamation of surprise, except it also means 'parent'. -GHS

It was a quiet new school term, when even the cicadas didn't cry.
//Even more Higurashi inspiration/homages. -GHS
