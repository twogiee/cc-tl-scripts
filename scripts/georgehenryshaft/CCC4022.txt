IF $KAISOU == 1 JMP SCENE001

[Taichi]
"It hUUUrts..."

I was slapped awake by dull pain.
//疼 hi Touko. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Huh, this is Ore no Himitsu no Heya? (My Secret Room?)"
//...maybe I should just mix in some German, hmmm... -GHS

Ah, I'm dressed but not in my uniform anymore.
My injury was also treated. Very nicely, as well.
//She was acting in CCC4007. -GHS
Youko-chan... she had died hasn't she.
//HACK music here. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, good morning!"

Miki had come in.

[Taichi]
"You are Mitchy?!"

[Miki]
"This is Mitchy. But that's really stretching it."
//Known nickname for Empress Michiko, prolly what CCC0011C referred to. -GHS
[Miki]
"This house had nothing whatsoever to eat in it. I stole some rice and some miso from the neighborhood."
//The usual curious use of words, as with her "buy" back for the elephant underwear. PS2 version erases that, even more suspiciously. Which also reminds: why doesn't Taichi do the same...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, it's because Mutsumi-san doesn't really have all that much time to cook, 's all."

She only buys how much is necessary for what she's making.
//Interesting he keeps drumming on how it's perfectly justifiable for there to be nothing in the house, isn't it. -GHS

[Miki]
"Any pain?"

[Taichi]
"Looots!"

I cried.

[Miki]
"Ah, there, there. Here, it's menstruation medicine."

[Taichi]
"Don'want it, no!"
//girly... -GHS

I throw it away.

[Miki]
"Well, it has a pain relieving effect... here."
//Odd she'd have it instead of Kiri, Miki doesn't seem on her period. Maybe she just took a page out of the Taichi bag(?). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, thaaat's why, sorry."

[Miki]
"I have cooked something."

[Taichi]
"...what's this huge star-shaped Konpeito-like object?"

It was an excessively warped and beautifully wrecked thing.

[Miki]
"A rice ball."
//See CCC3019, uncertain but appears to still be one of those Rice Ball onigiris. Almost as soupsycious as referring chips as 'crisps'. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You entered the realm of genius via excess of talentlessness, I see."
//HACK shocked Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"How do you even hold it in your hands to make it in a shape like this."
//HACK annoyed Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Normally."
//Seems to make sense. Grasp it normally and it'll leave horns in the gaps between the fingers. Why, if I were into decoben I'd totally try that. I'd have to survive stabbing myself with a spork every waking moment for being into decoben, however. (If you don't know what decoben is, good for you.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"This rice ball is as mysterious as the secrets of the gods."
//Visuals. Miki's Rice Ball Onigiri Of 100% Rice Ball Onigiri Rice Ball Ball Ball Ball Onigiri Rice Ball Rice Ball Onigiri 100% Of Ball is inspired by the Gods. I suppose since her archetype should say she's a Lethal Cook, but that's not really seen unfortunatelyBall. -GHS

I try eating.

[Taichi]
"Whoa, delicious!"

[Miki]
"Got some garnishes."

[Taichi]
"...hoh."

Strong salty flavor,
//She still screwBall Ball Ball Balled up the Ball Ball Ball Ball 100% -GHS
that it permeates my body lacking in sufficient blood.
I annihilated three of them at once,
and drink the miso soup in a single gulp.

[Taichi]
"...wheeew."
//See CCB2002. Role reversal? -GHS

[Miki]
"It was done as best I could."

[Taichi]
"The wound hurts, but some sex would be OK, Miki."

[Miki]
"You have questions, so please think about them a little."

[Taichi]
"...theeen."
//HACK Slightly annoyed Ball instead of redisplaying the same Ball. -GHS

[Miki]
"Theeen what..."

[Taichi]
"Why did you keep me alive then?"

[Miki]
"...hmmm, somehow or other the rampancy seems to have quieted... after that."
//Once again, he never was rampant. He only tried to lure in Kiri, and that was pure self-defense. Either Miki doesn't understand, or Taichi going rampant means nothing what it seems. ...unless she's not referring to him, but the alternative would be Kiri. -GHS
[Miki]
"I wanted to talk to the you that knows everything, Senpai... maybe."

[Taichi]
"Say now, just before you made me faint..."

[Miki]
"Waaah WaaaAaah! I can do without that!"
//See CCC4012. She fails at a villain as badly as Taichi. -GHS

She flaps and swings her hands.

[Miki]
"Because that time I wanted to be killing you, I swear!"
//See CCA0013. The parallels with Yusa will only become more heavy-handed in her Sendback. Her imitative behavior goes far and wide. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...too late, I heard it already."

[Miki]
"Ngh, ngggh〜"

And face goes red.

[Taichi]
"Looks like you can feel embarrassment."

[Miki]
"Welll, I do have the four basic emotions."
[Miki]
"I'm just apathetic with regards to others, pfui!"
//Youko and... -GHS

Pfuing me, Miki turned away from me.
//...Touko now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I thought you took me as nothing more than your playmate."
//See CCA0013 again, one more reason to keep Desu-Masu like that. -GHS

[Miki]
"...there's also that."

Is there now.

[Taichi]
"Sooo... could it be that the only ones alive in this world are just the two of us?"

[Miki]
"Sakuraba-senpai...?"

[Taichi]
"That guy's gonna die off in the streets like roadkill. Maybe. He might just be already dead. Tripped over and his bags struck his head... something like that."
//Metaphorically he just left the valley. -GHS

[Miki]
"...likely."

[Taichi]
"We became sooo few."

[Miki]
"When next week turns around, all club members will be revived once more."

[Taichi]
"If I were to go in the hokora, too, would I be able to preserve myself as I am now?"

[Miki]
"Yes, indeed! Do you want to live as you are now?"

[Taichi]
"Naaah."
//At this point, rejecting this is to reject controlling everyone. It's the right choice here. Next route, when he's forgotten (or rather, because he hasn't quite understood his lesson), he'll try to pull a Miki, understand its futility, and finally accept his job. Miki's imitative behavior picks up on this, even if Taichi doesn't yet, and that's why she gives up her idiotic plan. -GHS
[Taichi]
"My memories of this week are bit... painful, so to say."
[Taichi]
"...somehow or other, there's a part that's alright even though everybody's dead."

[Miki]
"......"

[Taichi]
"My heart, it... it won't cry at all."
//That's false, it cries. It's just squeezed down, and it comes out in a different, wrong way. That he's hurt by feeling that he's not hurt by this demonstrates he's nowhere near the monster he wants to be. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...that, I think it's something I should just forget."
//This is the error he's still making, and why he doesn't fully learn the lesson: he should be remembering and living with these events, too. He may not want to use it to dominate, but wearing the Ring to escape the villains is not going to work either. Luckily, while he might have not much of a Sam-kuraba, he's got his own private Gollum ready to crawl up his Onigiri about it (literally). -GHS

[Miki]
"Right then."

[Taichi]
"If the world really repeats itself... then time and again I would go rampant and hurt people, wouldn't I?"
[Taichi]
"Friends and family and companions and even the ones I love."
[Taichi]
"Time after time after time I would kill... and to live with the memories of that..."
[Taichi]
"My heart would break, I'm sure."
[Taichi]
"It's already breaking, but, it would break even more."
[Taichi]
"My heart would just die."

Having said it that explicitly, I realize that I've been implying something to Miki.

[Taichi]
"Ah, sorry..."

[Miki]
"Nooo-thiiing."
[Miki]
"Truth is, that's exactly what's happened."
[Miki]
"There were horrible moments, Senpai, when to escape from your rampancy I had to sacrifice everyone else."
//Possibly Tower of Friends goes here. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, sorry about that. Mea culpa."
[Taichi]
"Well, thinking yourself precious is probably normal. Isn't that good?"
//This is where things like the line in CCZDXC come from. -GHS

[Miki]
"...but."

[Taichi]
"Yeah, self-sacrifice's also nice, but, in the end it can't all become something so beautiful."
[Taichi]
"'Cause this is a world that forcibly demands beauty."
[Taichi]
"Me, you know, in order to get accepted by the world, I was doing my absolute best to become friendly, but... however many years of work I did, nothing would ever change."
//he's STILL blaming his looks BallTW. More importantly, this is part of what got him into his nervous breakdown. Also, he's been doing the same shtick for years and it isn't working. Well, duh, Sherlock. -GHS

[Miki]
"...so it was."

[Taichi]
"Really, that I'd still become someone that someone else could fall in love with, got some thankfulness for that."

[Miki]
"......aw."
//AuAuAu -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yusa-chan, you remember her right?"

[Miki]
"Yes."
//Very well, too, given all the above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Why do you think that girl stopped being around?"
//HACK earlier Ball -GHS

Well-ordered facial features just barely modify their position, as a possibility is magnificently expressed in the form of question:
//Might as well be talking Youko and be that the end of it. This is possibly what Youko felt about Taichi back then, and Miki's may be the same as Youko's as far as Onigiri ultramarines go. -GHS

[Miki]
"Because Senpai did something horrible to her?"

[Taichi]
"Right on."
[Taichi]
"In the end, all I was showing her was my best-dressed surface."
//But this Miki would've seen him at his most horrible, time and time and time again... and STILL fell in love with him. Even setting aside how his "worst" may be nothing of what she says it is (see the safe and the Club Room), if the surface/masquerade thing is a problem, it is so in its existence and not in what it hides. This further reinforces the reading that what Yusa grew to hate of Taichi was his refusal of what she had inside (very very literally), nothing else. -GHS
[Taichi]
"...how shocked she had to have been."

[Miki]
"Seven times."
//Someone surprised? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Miki]
"I've been always exploiting Kiri-chin, but, that is the number of times she found out."

[Taichi]
"...that's quite a few times."
//HACK Rice 100% instead of redisplaying Onigiri Ball -GHS

[Miki]
"I make lotsa blunders."

[Taichi]
"Which reminds me, that kick on Monday was way keen."

[Miki]
"Ehahah."

[Taichi]
"When you keep doing this survival thing by yourself, your skills in using the body reeeally get good."

[Miki]
"I revel in my own talent!"

[Taichi]
"...so, what does Kiri-chin do?"
//present as it's multiple events -GHS

[Miki]
"Welll!"

An unserious smile.

[Miki]
"Well, at first she's stupefied. Then..."
//HACK Onigiri doll. -GHS

Darkening.

[Miki]
"...ohhh, she is met with suitable measures."
//Might not be the horrible thing that seems obvious. After all, she's talking about how KIRI reacts. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Painful?"
//Almost entirely Youko's damnable words, this. -GHS

[Miki]
"...painful... it does feel like that."
[Miki]
"There's also this feeling that it's like, who cares."
//These are deliciously flat ch--- ambiguous. Since Kiri might not be killed at all, this might also be what she feels. -GHS
[Miki]
"But this becomes a habit eventually. Sort of like, if we've been a Pair up until now, we gotta be a Pair forever."
[Miki]
"...even in feelings."
//Possibly why Kiri feels the same as Miki when it comes to betrayal. Remember Sendback: when Kiri learns of Yutaka's betrayal, after crying, she's more relieved than anything. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It's sort of how I was, then."
//Meaning he accepts that Youko doesn't really care about him. -GHS

[Miki]
"Welll, living's just..."
//100%x3xl -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hard innit..."

[Miki]
"Yes..."

Double pensiveness.
//I really can't use 'twin' here... there's enough closeness here without implying actual brotherhood. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So, what do we do? After this I mean?"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, riiight."
[Miki]
"Whatever it is, tomorrow at noon I want to be inside that hokora, so."
//Reset is at noon Sunday. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I want to try to experience the reset of the world, yes."

[Miki]
"Well, sooo I'm going to..."
//HACK earlier leave -GHS

With a moment of hesitation, Miki leaned towards me.
Dodged.

[Miki]
"G'fuh!"
//HACK shake screen -GHS

Miki falls prostrate on the bed.

[Miki]
"Ahhh... seriously you!"
//Very Tomoki this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry, dinn'mean it, thought I was gonna get eaten'."
//HACK tweaked line. -GHS

[Miki]
"Totally ruined..."
[Miki]
"I'm going home. Senpai, please open that safe over there and use those porn books of levels by me unimaginable to have self-sex."
//See CCB2009. Nice to remind us of one of the most blatant metaphors for Taichi not being the monster he seems to be. -GHS

She knew it!
No, more importantly,

[Taichi]
"Wait up, wait up!"

Grabbing her wrist,
I pull her close.

[Miki]
"Uh-?"

She's quickly into my chest.
//I think it should flow with the above, but since there's scene replay... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sorry, I accidentally put too much strength in that."

[Miki]
"...totally devoid of romanticism..."

[Taichi]
"Wildness sells."

[Miki]
"You're not wild either... liar, your advertisement is just a scam!"
//Yup, he's not evil or wild or anything. All literally true! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Don't say that."

[Miki]
"...sigh, just forget about the romance."

[Taichi]
"That's how it goes within this world."

Miki had become an adult in one more way.

[Taichi]
"It's dark, still alright?"

[Miki]
"...obviously I'm fine with being in the dark..."
//...or she wouldn't have tried it now. -GHS

It's not like that's much to do with me, though.
I strip off her clothes.
//This'll happen a few times too many... -GHS

[Miki]
"S-, so fast and so skilled... but that's to cry."
//Console version calls her http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miffy, turns her mouth into a Batten via kiss (???????), "why are you making that X-like mouth?", cutesy denials, "let's icha-icha", and one mother of an epic line that unfortunately has to stay on the floor: "A MURDERER IS FINE, TOO!" (tsukkomi'd with the Sakuraba-appropriate "don't you say that!", see CCA0030). -GHS

[Taichi]
"I know no laziness when it comes to techniques for stripping girls."

[Miki]
"You're the worst..."
[Miki]
"Before I'm naked..."

[Taichi]
"Mh."

Lips,
being made to touch.
Within the right distance, we nuzzled.

[Miki]
"Mh... nh..."

Nimble liptalk.
I inserted tongue, and licked around the gums with urgency.

[Miki]
"Fmhyah???"

Holding down around the lips with her hand, her eyes dart around in shock.
And then she cried a bit.

[Taichi]
"This is what it's like."

[Miki]
"Is it now..."

[Taichi]
"Gladden me with ceasing your opposition, and with opening your mouth."

Second time. I push inside.

[Miki]
"Nhmuh... ah... nh, nnnh... fhah, fhah... nnnh... hFah."
[Miki]
"Ah... I'm being stripped..."
//That's #3. Do we go up to 7? -GHS

I start licking from the saliva that spills from the edge of Miki's lips,
to the nape of her neck.

[Miki]
"uHyyy... hYaAAAh..."

The upper part of her body shrunk tightly as Miki's voice made her sound ill at ease.
Slipping an arm through, I also touch her chest.

[Miki]
"Ah..."

There's some surprise, but no resistance.
Both lips and nose gently caress the nape as I continue touching her chest.
A chest somewhat fuller than that of the Miki I knew.

[Miki]
"HyAh... nh, nnh, tick-, les..."
[Miki]
"Nh, nnnnh, nnh... ah..."

So cute.
I leave her with a hickey.
//hee hee -GHS

[Miki]
"AH! OwcHies..."

However it goes, there's no more than the two of us (Sakuraba excluded).
//Dude, c'mon, you can't be bored already... -GHS
I rub her breasts as if trying to enfold them.
...they don't have the volume for that, but, I massage so as to warm them up.

[Miki]
"Nh..."

[Taichi]
"Tickles?"

[Miki]
"...somewhat..."

[Taichi]
"You'll get used to it soon!"
//Reminds of CCA0012 -GHS

[Miki]
"Nh, nnh... aHnh..."

I give love bites on her collarbone, while leaving marks all over Miki's chaste upper body.
Miki is getting a bit used to it, maybe, and her stiffness lessens,
so that it will not intrude on my motions, but be obedient to them.

[Miki]
"Hihyh... anh, ah... kyah... nh...... nnh... Senpai..."

[Taichi]
"Hug me, it's fine."

Having so said, her arms grasped on the center of my back.

[Taichi]
"I want to embrace you too, Miki."

[Miki]
"Kyah... NNNNNh!"

Another hickey.
//because she slipped him a mickey. *badum-tish* -GHS
Leaving marks behind evokes arousal.
It's likely my desire for conquest.
//See CCA0021 -GHS
And that, itself, is another meaning for a connection with another person.

[Taichi]
"How is it?"

[Miki]
"...so good... the way you touch me, Senpai..."
[Miki]
"My neck seems to feel so good... it does..."

[Taichi]
"Then I'm going to kiss you more."

The groove between her neck and collarbone has a refreshing sleekness that men's lack.
Extending the tongue, I place it on that beautiful spoon.

[Miki]
"Uuuh, nh, kyahnh... nh, hah, hahnh..."

The fingers head below,
tracing abdominal muscles with no trace of excess fat, to tickle the belly button.

[Miki]
"AAAAH... aah... you can't, Senpai... not inside the belly button you caaan't..."

Does she think I'm going to put it inside there?
Killing a laugh in my teeth, I move downwards furthermore.
//A bit off tone, but... I mean, c'mon, it's been used like this so far. I suppose Tanaka knows what he's doing. Which seems to be trying not to fall asleep, as usual. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah......"

She stiffens.

[Taichi]
"It's OK."

Whispering that, I put my tongue in her ear.

[Miki]
"NNNH! Nh... no, you can't, don't lick me, not there... nh... ah."

My fingers pass through her bush.
Mmmh, bush.
//Uh... screw it, just laugh? -GHS
Retracing my steps, enjoying that tactile sensation.

[Miki]
"Th-, that's just my perverted fur... aah... aHnh..."

[Taichi]
"Even the fur here is perverted?"
//WTF seriously -GHS

So I said, bullying her a bit.

[Miki]
"...bully〜..."

[Taichi]
"Hahahah."

And soon afterwards, I wrap a finger in that swishing fur and play,
her ear held in my mouth.
//Put fish in you mouth? -GHS

[Miki]
"Kyah? No... no..."
//やや is copypasted from... uhm... *CTRLs through* -GHS

With a shudder the nape of her neck gets goosebumps.
Ahhh, so it's the ears.
Bite.
//Now she's Miyuki. She's run pretty much the entire cast on this, hasn't she? -GHS
A crisp, crunchy sensation.

[Miki]
"Uhhhh, uUUUU〜〜〜〜〜h!"

Shivering with a chill, sweat appears on her forehead.
Seems to be feeling this far too much.
One light kiss, and then back to the breasts again.

[Miki]
"Fwah, hAhAh... Senpai... Taichi... Senpai..."

Tightly,
the hand on my back seize my clothes.
...as if to claw at my back.
Sliding my fingers straight and hard, I sink them to the root of her legs.

[Miki]
"...ah..."

The thick of the index finger covered that rift perfectly.
That straight central line is damp and hot.
And then,

[Taichi]
"Getting wet."

[Miki]
"...I am getting wet."

Stroking.

[Miki]
"Uh, uuUUh... aUh... ahnh... hAaaah, inside, in... it feels like you'll put it..."

[Taichi]
"Yep, I'll put it inside."

I begin to bend the fingertips.
The unfolded membranes and the bodily fluids mix and jumble together.
I squirm and wriggle around, my fingers like spider's legs.
//But are her mysterious four limbs spidery? Inquiring porn writers want to know! -GHS

[Miki]
"Hyihuh!"

Miki's kneecaps leap straight up and smack into my sides.

[Miki]
"You can't, if you spread them, it's like it'll drip... it's drippiiing!"

[Taichi]
"I'd say that's OK."

I sucked her chin loud enough to make a noise.

[Miki]
"Nahnh... you cannot... it all... feels too good... so..."

My fingers adhere completely to Miki's genitals.
Five long poles stirring a crucible.
It melts, and becomes mushy and slimy.

[Miki]
"Hah, hah, ...ah, nnh... nh, hah, inside... coming...! gHnh!"

Legs go rampant.
I use fingers even more.
The genital saliva clumps and leaks outwards,
//SEXY. Then again, if it's not obvious, someone has a saliva fetish. -GHS
and it gathers on my palm, leaking over from the base of the fingers to the sheets.

[Miki]
"AAAaaah..."

An embarrassed sigh.

[Taichi]
"Naughty leaking."
//Also peeing (see below) -GHS

[Miki]
"...ngh..."

Moist eyes pierce through me.
Every possible permission imaginable was inside them.

[Miki]
"Yes... wet... I got wet..."
[Miki]
"Senpai, too, down there... you will wet yourself too, right?"
//I think she's asking if he peed himself... or if men get wet like girls? -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

The hell you say?
//This ain't that kind of game yet! -GHS
I kissed her.

[Miki]
"Nh, NNNNH, nfhuh... nh, hrh... hot... senpai, hot... nHrhuh... nnnh, n-, nnnh..."

Deeper and deeper I kissed.
I begin wanting to be mixed with Miki.
//Mik'sser again? This is totally intentional. -GHS
I don't seem to be satisfied via membranes alone.
//What about paramecium alone? Does that work? -GHS
My fingers stir up Miki's deepmosts.
Tiny folds,
that I rub longitudinally with the belly of the fingers.

[Miki]
"NNNNNNNNNNNH?!"

Her lap leaps up,
as if it was glued to the fingers.

[Miki]
"Nh, nmhuh, nnnh, pch, pch, NNNNh!"

Miki has been sucking my tongue.
I'll try leaving it to her.
My tongue is handled very delicately, as if it were a candy being sucked.
//She Taichingly loves tongue. -GHS

[Miki]
"Nh, nhuh... nh, nnnh, hah, hahfh... nh..."

Calmly her hips fall back down.
Her tiny buttocks flexibly laid on the sheets.

[Miki]
"hFah... it's cold...?

[Taichi]
"It's your fault, Miki."

I go explain it to her gently. The result is bullying.
Miki's head changed color and became as if all the blood throughout the body had assembled into it.

[Miki]
"Really... all worn."

[Taichi]
"It's pretty!"

[Miki]
"...I love you."

[Taichi]
"Mhhh."

I go trace the intravaginal with the middle finger,
carefully, caaarefully,
//so if 丁 is the finger going inside (the line'd be the hand) then 寧 is *CTRL* -GHS
as if spreading around Miki's own bodily fluids.

[Miki]
"Ugh, ugh... fhah, aah, nh, ghnh..."

Jolting, her waist leaps up.
Her limbs twitched, as if the petals of a flower, struggling.
//Ugh. Seems to be found around porn writing. Really bad porn writing. Heeey, wait a second... -GHS
The leaking sexual fluids had also moistened the hole in the rear.
She feels great just by having fingers inside.
...and carnal desires to make my hips ache made me hard myself.
Using the fingers, I knead around that ring-shaped entrance.

[Miki]
"uWah... what, what are... you can't, caaan't, what iiis, caaan't! Senpaaai, danger, that's dangerous, fwAAAAhnh!"

She's saying something weird.
I make the fingers shake rapidly,
around and around near the rough opening.
Miki's limbs lift up.
Her folded legs and her head lay close to each other, her back drawing an arc.

[Miki]
"Ah, can't, ah, aah, nh, ahnh, AHHH, AHHH..."

And yet I still move the fingers, tingling, prickling.

[Miki]
"............"

For about three seconds Miki loses both words and breath,
then,

[Miki]
"Aah, ah, ah, ah, AAah, nh, ah, AAAaAaaaahHHHh!"

The fingers are squeezed, tightly.
Contractions.
Gripping tightly, then loosening. Then back from the top again.

[Miki]
"Haaah... hah, haaah... ah... ...nh..."

I try slower rubs.

[Miki]
"Hy, wOh, dooon't..."

She appears to be seriously trying to run away.
I removed the fingers.
Light kisses on those lips struggling so hard with rough breathing.

[Miki]
"Ugh... hfuh... hAhuhnh..."

Miki seeks the proffered lips, almost unconsciously.
A disappointed sigh when I distance my head.
Miki seemed totally exhausted.
Lying her belly down, I remove her clothes.
A mountain-shaped stain was left in the part that touched Miki's butt.
//山-shaped. ... -GHS
Love juices and sweat, that followed upwards through the gap of the butt.
No lack of excitement here.

[Miki]
"Haaah, haaah, haaah..."

Slowly Miki's breathing falls, and she begins to want to fall asleep.
From the back, I quietly begin to cover her.
Putting my arms around her hips, I made them lift up.
//Did you notice that except for Sendback, all the actual intercourse sex scenes are with the girl face down? ALL of them? This is why you don't remove even this stuff of Tanaka's. -GHS

[Miki]
"...hah, haaahnh... Sen... pai?"

She realizes that she has been made to lay face down.
//Lay is when you have sex; lie is when you are a lier; unsure what to do when one is a liar. I think you have to be soft, but that may require being a rail as well as pretty much unreadable. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm here!"

[Miki]
"Nh〜"

Right after I whispered from behind, Miki moaned sweetly.
With lengthy soft caresses, I slipped inside that welcoming part of her.
//Damn, Taichi looks sort of malnourished here. -GHS

[Miki]
"...nnnh... UH-, UUUUUH!"

She groans in reluctance,
however, the wetness helped her.
Sliding inside naturally and smoothly, I touched the bottom.
Just the faintest of stop and starts on the way, certainly Miki's chastity.

[Miki]
"Ah, aaah, AH..."

She's surprised,
her mouth was open wide,
and a trembling voice spills outside.
I slide her hips back and forth,
her inner wall coiling around me,
tightened until gaplessness.
//See CCC3027 MY MY MY WHAT IS THIS SELF-pppPLAGIARi *CTRL* -GHS
A narrow lane that I now run back and forth in.
//Can we have fish metaphors back? -GHS

[Miki]
"Auh, ah, uhhh, sooo... big..."
//That's what she said! Wait, is that where you use it *search, search* *realizes* *CTRL* -GHS

Because she's tight.
And for Miki, no mistake, it must feel particularly painful.
Deliberately, taking my time, I push my hips until I am into her depth.
The tip touched a part that had a certain stiffness to it.
//Pro tip: that actually hurts. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...you're just perfect, Miki. For mine."

[Miki]
"Nooo... so embarrassing..."

The pole is moistened.
Internal secretions have increased.
Perhaps because of this good angle, it almost feels as if we are connected in a single long straight line.
It's hot, and so tight, being held inside her all the way to the base.
Motion.
Gentle at the very start,

[progressively faster]


this is how I move via the rod that couples us.
//I simply have no idea if this is intentional. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah... aah, nh, ah, ah, aH-aH-aH-aH... ...!"

An adorable staccato on every stroke.
This finely sliced shriek increases an octave into shrill.
//I truly can't decide if this is awesome or just silly. -GHS

[Miki]
"Fwh, ah, ah-ah-ah, aAAh, nh, hYahn, n〜h!!!"

Soon she spat saliva.
Cheerful little Miki is fraying, so that her nature of honey-sweet girl comes to the surface as if a relief.
//Hum, term typically used to indicate falling into one's ultramarine. Then again, Miki's ultramarine is similar to Taichi's: lots of posing to avoid actually showing themselves. -GHS

[Miki]
"Aaah, aOoh, ah, gH, ahnh, aAahnh!"

Her ass, so small in size, catches the blow of the pelvis.
Nothing but a depraved form of spanking.
Supple, the back sways in response to the movement.
The shoulder blades stretch backwards to their limit, then sink.
Miki now supports herself on a single arm, and the timing of motions begins to vary between the left and right sides as well.
Beautiful.
I try touching,
she was damp.
Beads of sweat that reminded of grains of wheat.
My fingertips slid downwards until the tailbone.
//His hands are still on her back. -GHS

[Miki]
"KyAhUhhhhhhh!!!"

Huge reaction.
The vagina reacted strongly.
It tightens, tightens, tightens.
Three times more I was put under pressure.

[Miki]
"WaUh, uHwaaaah..."

From her excessively wet region, the fruitsweet juices become drops and trickle down.
//!!!SHE SECRETES FR00T JUICE!!! think of the mark--- wait it's just a manko/mango juice pun, right? -GHS
Enough that the sound of dripping water, plic, plic, reaches the ears.
She seemed to have a large amount of "wettening".
//... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Miki..."

This may be conceited,
but if she disliked me, she wouldn't have this reaction.
Not for the filth that I am.
Miki might say she loves me, maybe,
but the meaning of that 'love' is, likely, slightly different from that of the general convention.
//This is all his whining, because *CTRL* see CCA0023 -GHS
However,
what an irreplaceable thing that even I managed to attain.
Violent passion bursts out.
I want to be more connected. More!

[Miki]
"Fwuh, hah, hahnh, ahnh, ah, ah, hahnh, hahnh! Nhkh... hy, uHnh, nh, woAAAh, senpAAAi!"

Miki clutches the bedsheets.
And I, with identical reason, drive my wedge of meat into Miki.
//...are you even... -GHS
I apply waist,
//あてがう -GHS
drawing letters.
//T, R, O, L, L -GHS

[Miki]
"...aOh?!"

It added a slight vibrato to her heavy breathing.
//?????????????? -GHS
Simultaneously, Miki straightened out one leg. Stretching it.
Straightened in a line, and desiring more and more to be a straight line.
//...is she actually having a cramp? o_O -GHS
I continue drawing letters,
//F, U, C, K, Y, O, -, W, A, I, T, T, O, O, L, A, T, E -GHS
mixing in movements back and forth.

[Miki]
"Uh, ugggh, AH! ahyh, nnnh, nnNNNN〜〜〜〜〜〜〜hhh!!!"

Her tiny butt quakes, trembling and shivering.
//Her butt must be really small. Is it a loli sex scene thing? Need to investigate *installs even more loli nukiges* -GHS
A transitioning of expansion and contraction, that continues until her posterior is fully contracted.
//Now he's just being obtuse. Don't think he's using 動転 laterally. -GHS
Lowering her posture to a crouching start, Miki moans.
When I enter, she yields at the weight of my hips,
but, as the brushtip spells intravaginal sentences, all of a sudden the butt raises up, her body in the < shape of the ku hiragana.
//I don't see how this can be something else given the writing context. Apparently くの字[点] means a repetition mark, sort of like 々. I suppose that's the pun? Why is there a pun this messy here?! -GHS

[Miki]
"Hah, hahnh, Senpai, can't, dangerous, dange... aaah, ah, aOh, oH... oOOOh!"

She wrings down her lungs and casts out her voice, words unfinished.
But that broken voice too is to me something sweet.
I come to want to hear it more, and more.
Strong rhythm.

[Miki]
"Oh, ah, oOOh... twh, muchhh... fasH, faH, nHHh... NNNNNH!"

Miki is biting the pillow,
so her vulgar voice is pushed into it and killed off.
I slid a hand under her chin, and slowly raised it up.

[Miki]
"Fwah?"

She's removed from the pillow.

[Taichi]
"Voice, out with it."

[Miki]
"But... hic!"

Matching that sensual hiccup, the legs squeeze tightly just once.

[Taichi]
"Because I wanna hear your voice."

I buried my nose on the top of Miki's head,
pushing my way through the softness of her hair, licking the scalp.
//ew -GHS

[Miki]
"My-, my voice's embarrassing and..."

[Taichi]
"Don't wanna?"

[Miki]
"...fine."

She closes her eyes in acceptance.
Miki, herself, begins to thrust her hips backwards.
And I, also, grit my teeth in preparation of the act.
Our reciprocal sweat creates adsorption on the lower part of our bodies, so perfectly they adhere together.
//that's aDsorption. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Shall we move?"

[Miki]
"...ah... ah, yah..."

Degree by degree, I vary the angle of my coming and going.
Just with that Miki's nape gets goosebumps.
//why u not a verb, goosebump? -GHS
She seems to be feeling it so very much.
Miki, herself... might just possess the same craving as I, perhaps,
of wanting to be connected.
//This ties to the themes of the game via *CTRL* -GHS

[Miki]
"Fwhah, hahn, ah, ah, aAAAh... hahnh, nhAh!"
[Miki]
"No, can't, dangerous, iYYh... can't, caaan't, no more, no mooore!"

Not yet.
We've not yet completely become one.

[Miki]
"Ahhh, ah, aHaHaH, aaa〜〜〜〜〜h, AAAAh, nh, nnnnh, ahAAAaaa〜〜〜〜〜!!!"

The way I played the instrument of her sexuality moved to legato.
//I understand the poor writer, but... damn. -GHS
Miki's voice became continuous like a chain,
and in the tiny gaps on the way, Miki takes big breaths.
More. More---

[Miki]
"Uhhh, Ah-, AAAaaah... aHah, hahnh, hah... caaa't, too deep... caaaaaan't!"

Losing stamina, Miki's voice grows more moan-like,
but her sensitivity does not sink.

[Miki]
"Hyuh?!"

In the systematic well-regulated motions I occasionally mix letters with the hip, trying to get her whole body to leap up.

[Miki]
"Ah, ah, ah... ca-..."
//Is it visible that it's "can't"? No? Well, in that case *CTRL* -GHS

Unexpectedly her body convulsed.

[Miki]
"Ah...............〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜!!!!!"

I could see in the throbbing of her back the way that this now was different,
and one step behind, violent convulsions occurred inside.

[Taichi]
"Ngh..."

In the space of a second I am struck by a countless number of tiny undulating constrictions.
The width and depth of the vaginal walls mixes and jumble, and all is squeezed tight.
Shedding Miki's own control, they go rampant.

[Miki]
"aHkh... hyah... ah... hah, hah..."

Miki, their master, is made to passively receive this explosion of feelings with no choice in the matter.
//See CCC0000. Of course, he's becoming Connected and that's the only way he knows. That's why this route fails. -GHS
Soon,
recalling the weight of her own body, Miki begins to collapse.
I put a hand underbelly and support her.
At regular intervals, her abs were twitching and shivering.
Motion.

[Miki]
"Hy...i-, if you move now... ...I think I'll die..."

There's nothing that can be done about this.
//Both. -GHS
I intensify the intensity of the strumming motion.
//Instrument metaphor continues. -GHS

[Miki]
"AAaaah..."

A long breath of despair.
She's still excited,
however, I cannot see the ending of this.
The pain in the mouth of my wound was restraining me in subtle ways.
At every shake of my body I am completely traversed by the shrieking pain of the arrow wound.
But,
until I come inside of Miki this won't end.
I rub against her walls.

[Miki]
"C-, caaan't, that's... aHaHaHaah... aHaH... can't! Too fast, can't!"

You can say that all day long, but...

[Miki]
Ahuh, ah, uh, uah... tired... so... aAaAaAaAAAA..."

The rhythm of her voice collapses.

[Miki]
"Senpai, senpah, haaah, haaaah, aUh, AaAaaaah..."

Perhaps not seeing my face makes her uneasy.

[Miki]
"Senpai, senpAh, Taichi-senpai..."

I go push my nose into her hair,
which tells her that I am just behind her.
Miki's gentle fluffy smell and the feeling of being immobilized by the genitals flow into an harmony and numb the brain.
In the depths covered with the finest folds I move in and out with the longest strokes.

[Miki]
"Don-, donn' understand... more, donn' understand... aah... can't, can't can't, Senpai, caaan't!"

Her voice is as a mutter.
She wants to just go limp, but with this stimulus she can't.
//Speaking of which, 100 lines to go... -GHS
That's what it feels like.
I'm more and more aroused, and I continue pushing deeply.
The moment when it's all inside to the root, the minute folds rub the entire enveloped part.
It's as if I melt,
and once I'm no more, I flow inside Miki's womb.
That is the illusion I have.

[Miki]
"Amaazing, it's amaaaaaazing... I'm becoming strange..."

I've become strange as well by now.
//This is fundamentall imjperxcZZZ *faceplant into CTRL* -GHS
Abruptly, the base of the genital throbs.
Pleasure began to outpace the pain.

[Taichi]
"Ah... think I'm coming."

[Miki]
"...come, plea-, se..."

Painfully said.

[Taichi]
"You coming too, Miki?"

[Miki]
"Ughhh, impossible, it's impossible..."

[Taichi]
"No way, you come too Miki!"

I shake left and right.

[Miki]
"Hy... th-, that movement dooon't... I can't breathe anymore..."

[Taichi]
"This one?"

[Miki]
"AaaahDooon't!"

The area our joining twists, and the coupling comes unmade.

[Taichi]
"Ah... Miki..."

The moment I'm out of her, she flops prostrate.
//soff? Well, she's on the bed. -GHS
That's so pitiful, but...
I raise her hips and once more penetrate.

[Miki]
"NNNgh..."

Ears go red,
perspiration from the whole body as well.
Because our physical strengths are different, whatever I do puts burden on Miki.
I squash down with the hips,

[Miki]
"AH... uuuh..."

insatiably lusting for that hot, muddy area.

[Miki]
"Ah... I, coming..."

[Taichi]
"Eh, you're coming?"

[Miki]
"Co... ming..."

Clenching, her ass bent back.
It lifted up my hips from below,
tightening around me all the way to the root.
The pleasure grows, but I still can't peak.

[Miki]
"Haaah, haaah..."

Breathing goes rough.
Motion.

[Miki]
"Aaah, hah... hah... Senpah... uUUh!

I'm squeezing the very vitality out of Miki.

[Miki]
"Ah, don't, don't, comin, gggg---"

Convulsions.
She had the vitality to just shake, no more.
Without her limbs going rampant, the carnality rages within her body, and Miki is spurred onwards more and more.

[Miki]
"Ah, again, coming again..."
//Come again? -GHS

How many times does that make it?
Miki couldn't stop anymore.

[Miki]
"Auh..."
//TL Note: AU means gold. -GHS

Peaking, wordlessly, again.
My carnality, too, little by little also swells.
I will likely be spewing out soon.

[Miki]
"Ca-, you can't, ah..."

The drawstring of her purse tightening,
//Supposing this means "the opening of her pussy squeezes down". -GHS
and making use even of that pressure, I move.

[Miki]
"NgGgGgGh..."

A harsh treatment for Miki,
however,
I can't do this in any other way.

[Miki]
"...can't... die... think I'll die... ...!!!!"
//Indeed it's midnight here and I am so close and yet... -GHS

Irregular contractions increase the stimulus many tenfolds.
Aaah---
My end has come.
One vigorous shake, and, finally, I pointed the nozzle right at the deepest.
I come.

[Miki]
"Hahaaa... ah... uh..."

Miki's vagina ingurgitates.
//Ugh, purple. -GHS
The gulping twitch of the walls resembles the motion of a throat,
inviting me in.

[Miki]
"Hah, hah, hah... hauh... haWah... uUuh..."

So tied together, the two of us laid down.

[Miki]
"Hah, haah, hah... haaah."

Leeway to exchange words there isn't,
as Miki seems she will be falling asleep like this.

[Taichi]
"...Miki."

Hugging her, I kissed all of her that my lips could reach.
And then, still like that, I closed my eyes as well.
//CTRL DOESN'T ACTUALLY WORK HERE BWAAAAAH -GHS
$SNCCC4022 = 1
//you know this script somehow left me hungOnigiri Ballry which is odd since I hate fishRice 100%. -GHS
