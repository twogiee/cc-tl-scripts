[Misato]
"Really, these little scrapes are no issue at all."

[Taichi]
"Eh, but they're nice and bleeding?"

[Misato]
"But I bleed much more every month."
//It's referring to how often she cuts her wrists in suicidal pain, of course. No, I'm kidding, but see the Kiri bathroom scene; ohhh now we have something. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bll〜〜〜〜l!"
//HACK fade to red -GHS

My nose erupts in an old-fashioned nosebleed.
//Menstrual blood breaks his brain. -GHS

[Misato]
"Kyaaah!"
//This either refers to an ancient diatribe regarding chopsticks, or this sentence will end halfway thr-GHS

[Taichi]
"On the occasion when a childhood friend that is to say a young girl is met by her menarche, the love manga of 'that' series might or might not have a scene or two of lurid graphicness!!!"
//Can't find what this series would be, and I'm even uncertain it's referring to any series in particular and it isn't just a trope of sorts. -GHS

I theatrically part with consciousness.
Badump.

[Misato]
"Eh, ehhh? Peke-kun?"
[Misato]
"Hey! Helloooo!"

Then,
//HACK Music here -GHS

[Taichi]
"...wha...?"

I am awake. White room. School infirmary.
I have been laid to sleep on a bed.

[Taichi]
"Ah, right... I triggered the Misato-senpai Menarche Scene."

* Dramatical mistake.
//Reference to Nitroplus' DRAMAtical Murder, which was released years after this, but that's no problem since Tanaka is a time traveler. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ooo-kay."

Seems I was put to bed.
By those slender arms...

[Taichi]
"Bwaaah, so embarrassing!"
//Just serve him lunch every day if he makes you nosebleed so, I'm sure he'll love those biiiig boobs of yours. You bloodmaker. -GHS

I buried my face in the pillow.

[Taichi]
"This smells of Senpai..."

Sniiiff, haaah, sniiiff, haaah.
Sniiiff, haaah, sniiiff, haaah.
Sniiiff, haaah, sniiiff, haaah, sniiiff, haaah, sniiiff, haaah. (* A sniffer, what a superhopeless human.)
* Madam, it's what I'm sniffing that is super!
//Original sound is "suu-haa", which is easily modifiable in "suu-paa", super, and that's the entire joke. Unless this is some sort of reference, that is just weak as hell. Then again, being a dumb meanie to Misato doesn't deserve the good jokes. -GHS
