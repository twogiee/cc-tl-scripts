I even went and counted them instead of immediately putting seven of them there. I must be getting slow. -GHS

The instant I left the house, thinking of maybe heading to school, I slipped and fell.
And hit my head.
//He hits his head, three seconds later we meet Youko in ways that shouldn't be equivocal for the first time. It's almost too good to be true. -GHS
I have one stout cranium, therefore there was no damage.
However...

[Taichi]
"Ngggh, what's this feeling like it's all foggy..."
//"Mowatto" seems a variant on もやもや http://okwave.jp/qa/q7341075.html "as if it my eyes had a bit of Kiri in front of it", heh, how appropriate. Seems to go nice with that "poyatto" below. This all fits so well with Miyuki's illness ("edges of the world become unfocused") it's just scary. -GHS

I can't explain this well even with a monologue.
//Then all is doom! (See CCX0001) -GHS
It's like, how to say... my heart was sugarcoated, like a bitter pill wrapped in oblaat.
//I had it done and adapted it so well as "beat around the bush", and then, during graphics reinsertion... well, since this is the one exception it will do half-explanation, half-googleitlazybones. -GHS
Like the reception of feelings and senses had grown dull.
And yet, that doesn't seem to be the whole of it either.
Like a tense bungee jumping rope that might just snap... something like that?
//Because this needed more references to Bungie... yes, it's officially transliterated バンジー, same as bungee. And he even added a seven right at the start. If this isn't intentional it's an almost astonishing coincidence. This is of course because Taichi Is About To Snap(tm), and it's toootally not to be taken at least as ambiguous of him having bonked his head somewhere and all this thing about Youko being very much literally in his mind. -GHS
Regardless, this is a weird situation, and I should perhaps just go to school.
//HACK end new lines -GHS
Youko-chan was there.
//Regardless of the above, I hope you've been paying attention. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh my?"
//See CCA0030. Odd she's in her uniform... odd that she's ALWAYS in her uniform. Far odder than it is for the rest. -GHS

[Youko]
"...mo-, morning."

Seems to be fairly frightened.
//See CCD5001. First time we ever see her, and she's frightened. -GHS
...too much teasing perhaps.
//And in the day before? I don't think so, buddy. This is pure Manifestation. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm not gonna do anything when we're in a situation this abnormal!"

I beckon her with the hand,
smiling.

[Taichi]
"Don't just stay over there, come over here."

A bit relieved, Youko-chan approaches.
I pinch her cheeks.

[Youko]
"......"

I've ended up harassing her reflexively.
Expectably, her expression does not change even one bit.
//Dolls can't change their expressions much. Whether Youko is an animate one or a literal one. -GHS
Still, her poker faced seemed to be somewhat disgusted.

[Taichi]
"'Morning."

[Youko]
"...liar."

[Taichi]
"Yes."

That's correct.

[Taichi]
"I am Arabesque after all."

[Youko]
"...picaresque is the correct word, I think."

[Taichi]
"......"
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

Squeeq.

[Youko]
"Hurts."

Pain complaint without batting an eye.

[Taichi]
"A mistake this obvious should be unforgivable for oneself."
//His instinctive pranking, her trusting him. -GHS

[Youko]
"Then one would best torment oneself... ah, that hurts, plenty..."
//"Flatly". If he's talking about both their mistakes, then she's talking about self-tormenting in both cases. If the mistake is made by the same person... and it works regardless, because of Alter Egos -GHS

She does not appear to be in a state of pain at all.

[Taichi]
"So, what's it you want?"
[Taichi]
"Showing yourself on this side of midnight is pretty rare. I thought you lived a life hidden in the shadows."
//Oddly, the term seems to mean "afternoon". But it's not afternoon at all, is it...? -GHS

[Youko]
"Here."

Paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Women's underwear?"

[Youko]
"Need some?"

[Taichi]
"Well... sure, why not?"

The human known as I was excessively reflexive.
//Both as 'automatic' and 'self-reflecting' of course. -GHS

[Youko]
"But in the dresser of my room there are as many as you may want."

[Taichi]
"Well, it's not like they have been freshly stripped off..."

[Youko]
"...understood."

She went to strip hers off.

[Taichi]
"Really now! I don'wann'em!"
//Inenional (x2) (x2) -GHS

[Youko]
"...mh."

[Taichi]
"If you take them off all blithely blithe, I might just sell them on an auction with picture attached, yes I might."
//Because "orosu", to slip down, also means to sell wholesale. ...how many did even get this one, seriously? -GHS

[Youko]
"...not nice, maybe."
//still passive-aggressive sorta -GHS

[Taichi]
"And mayhap wear them and in the meantime having four pairs on as hats while fitting just as many on both wrists in the place of bracelets, and thus indulge in a banquet of underwear onanism."
//He just threatened to wear Youko's panties. Shouldn't be unexpected of a cross-dresser, really. -GHS

[Youko]
"But that would be fine."

Fine it would be?
She said that all nonchalantly she did!
//Hi, Nanaka. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You know, girl... be more dignified. You're a third year are you?"
//See CCD2002... -GHS

[Youko]
"I am that."
//Both dignified and third year, I suppose. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Are being not. You're still sort of a killjoy."
//http://qarc.info/qa/show-9073-508.html seems to be a variant of ぐんにゃり. Not sure if it's an accent. -GHS

[Youko]
"...unthinkable."
[Youko]
"Taichi is unfocused."
//ぽやっと poyatto seems to be a variant of ぼやっと boyatto. doesn't seem to google to anything clearly different. 仮 kari seems to be the meaning, which isn't much different. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I'm of the age of wanting to lose focus you know. I'm adolescent remember!"

I go ascertain the contents of the paper bag.

[Taichi]
"...sandwiches?"

And a fairly large amount there was.

[Youko]
"The perishables had to be made into preserved food within the limits of the possible, these are with what was left."
//She seems do it especially with candies and cookies and the like, the damn pedo. There's not many ways "without" electricity to preserve stuff for long AFAIK. -GHS

[Taichi]
"They're handmade then."
[Taichi]
"...right, with no more people then vegetables and fruits..."

[Youko]
"For the time being. If we only tend to a limited number of fields and greenhouses... the degree of survivability for two people would then be..."

[Taichi]
"There are eight people."

So I say with a raised finger.

[Taichi]
"That way of thinking is not good. It will break your character as a human."
//AFAIK this is the only time 'ningen' is used explicitly laterally as 'character'. -GHS
[Taichi]
"We decided to live respectably, right?"

[Youko]
"...yes."

There is an obedient nod, however,
in the end this is nothing more than continuing to mechanically carry out what I said, without change.
Quite the cause of offense.

[Taichi]
"Thank you. I'll be graciously taking this. Sure seems that there's an awful lot of them, though."

[Youko]
"......"

I notice that her facial muscles (underfinger) move just slightly.

[Taichi]
"Almost as if this amount were intended for two."

[Youko]
"......"

I notice that her facial muscles (underfinger) move just slightly.
If I weren't touching her, I would never catch those microscopic changes in facial expression.

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"Almost as if this amount were intended for two."

I tried saying it one more time.

[Youko]
"......"

I notice that her facial muscles (underfinger) move just slightly.
//fun, eh, the fixed existence. -GHS
Ah-huh.
Wicked thoughts.
//Both of course, her (lame) plans -GHS

[Taichi]
"These sandwiches for two... most certainly, I will..."
