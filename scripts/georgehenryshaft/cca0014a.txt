"Hey, unyielding girl with the Reversible Character Attribute!"
//Tsundere, modern type. See CCB2005. -GHS

[Touko]
"Huh...?"

[Taichi]
"I'm giving you this."

I present her with the sandwich from this morning.
//Bait and switch there, since a first time reader should think he's eaten the curry bread with Yusa rather than having in excess via Youko. And viceversa, if these aren't Youko's at all. -GHS
Touko gazes at it, flabbergasted.

[Touko]
"What's this, even?"

[Taichi]
"Anman."

[Touko]
"'s not that at all you know!!! It's a sandwich you know!"
//lisp -GHS

[Taichi]
"So you do know don't you."
//Both the anman and the sandwich. Rich girl joke I guess. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Have it."

Slid over,

[Touko]
"...stop this."

a swat of her hands,
the sandwich fell,
recovered.

[Taichi]
"Are you eating properly?"

[Touko]
"That's... none of yer business."

Uncooperative.
//Ohhh man it begins. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Having no human alive, none outside of you, that worry about you... it's painful, right?"
//Hyperliteral as this is either her refusal to see mankind or, well, meant hyperliterally. See CCC0000: this is The Sentence. -GHS

[Touko]
"What's that even mean I don't know."

[Taichi]
"You want people to worry about you."
[Taichi]
"You want to be fulfilled."

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And me, I'm getting somewhat worried here."

She sternly glares at me.
//...with a stare that could explode heads. I can't be the only one to see the kanji as that. -GHS

[Touko]
"Look... who's talking."
//See CCA0005A -GHS
[Touko]
"If you're worried, then why, why!"
//"...did you break up with me?" -GHS

She loses her temper.

[Taichi]
"...Kirihara."

[Touko]
"What now!"

[Taichi]
"Your face looks off-color. Menses?"
//It sounds like he's ridiculing her, and that definitely is what she thinks, but he may be seriously worried. He does the same in CCD0020B. -GHS

Smaaack!

[Touko]
"Aren't you stupid!"

That curse spat out, she leaves.
//She does not make HIM leave... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, the sandwich..."

I sigh.

[Taichi]
"...that ain't a really good way to die ya know."
//Finally, see CCD0020B, where this line refers to himself. May be just an older revision, though. -GHS

Nothing I can do, so I undid the wrapping and bit into it myself.
