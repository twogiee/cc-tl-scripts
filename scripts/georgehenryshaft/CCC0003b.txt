Monday... then.
//Monday September 7, 1998 -GHS
Seven AM.
It's time to rise.
However!
   It's fine if you do not wake up, my boy---
//Taichi is hallucinating being a Little Red Riding Hood (who is usually a girl, of course), told by the Big Bad Wolf (who's generally identified with HIM) to stay in bed, so the wolf can eat him. If he doesn't get up, something very bad will come and devour him. And moments later... -GHS
>                                                                      grandmother
The resounding voice of a gentle obaa-chan.
//IT'S DELIRIUM TIIIME! Original has the 'voice' kanji needlessly ruby texted as the English 'voice'; that's a pretty chuuni thing to do... but generally not with elementary kanjis like this one. Did the same with something equally useless to keep untranslated. -GHS
I respond to it in my innermost thoughts.
           Truly now? How come then?
   It's all the better to eat you up with!---
//This should be the closest to the original fable, i.e. no hunter comes to rescue her; interesting (and creepy) that the wolf asks her to get into bed with him before eating her in this version. -GHS
            That's no hag. 's wolf.
And therefore, sleeping's no problem.

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh!"

So happy.
Mankind and all that may have fallen or something, but at this moment here, my euphoria is endlessly close to a god's.
//Random comparisons not random. -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi."
//...and speak of the wolf. Also see CCD5001, when he can't move from that bed for a whole week. Youko's intentions are not necessarily to get him to go to school. -GHS
[Youko]
"Taichi. Wake up."

[Taichi]
"Nooo〜〜〜oooh."

[Youko]
"No waking means perversion will ensue, I believe."
//See CCB2101. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...zzz..."

[Youko]
"...then."

Flomp!
Rustle, rustle, rustle!

[Youko]
"Nh... nhm..."
[Youko]
"Pch, pcHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
//damn. 7x3 う counting the one in... ゆ. -GHS

[Taichi]
"gh'WHAAAAAAAAA!!!"

An explosion of carnality in the lower half of the body.
In an instant I was led there.

[Taichi]
"...oh... oBhoBhoBh..."
//Contrast CCD5001 again: there she'll do her best to avoid actually having him come. -GHS

Dear dear, myself... you were having a wet dream.
There's some really strong arousal to boot.

[Youko]
"...nh... nKh... aHfh..."

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

Someone lies in my futon!

[Taichi]
"Who is it!"

And with that, I lunge out a kick.
Clank!
My attack with the heel, forged in Karade (strong regardless of direction), was caught without difficulty.
//Or he just kicked the wall right next to his bed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"?!"

As the impact is dodged, I am twisted down.
Is the intent to seal my movements?
//Still in Karade Mood, plus Youko preventing all of Taichi's movements. -GHS

[Taichi]
"!!!"

I forestall, and twist my body. Simultaneously, the other foot is dispatched,
but the heel only slashed air.
//The below had a replacement, with Youko just blowing in Taichi's ears... hmmm, another translingual pun? -GHS

[Youko]
"pCHhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"
//No text tags in the original, which is odd. Adding. Considering the one in the 'yu', it's 17 'u' 1+7=8. Otherwise, 16 (7). Which is obvious, since 'yu' is 8. -GHS

An explosion of pleasure. Second time.

[Taichi]
"AGHAaAaAaAaAaAaAh!!!"
//7x2 あ (interrupted by a 'go', 5 - hmmm 19, 9-1=8). -GHS

I shrimply threw my head back.

[Taichi]
"Sh-, steeop thiiis!"
//Seems to be Hakata-ben. Why? Because Japan. -GHS

In the struggle, I tumble down the bed,
and hit my head.

[Taichi]
"O-, ouch..."

It feels that, in the shock, I had lost a part inside of me that had tapered to a point.
//That's likely an unusually colorful euphemism for 'dick'. Unusually not because Japan, but because Console Version. Last of the new lines. -GHS
I raise up underpants and pajamas.

[Taichi]
"Whatch'ye be doin'!!!"
//http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1130346201 Hakata-ben for sure. It has been replaced with something. Just "something". -GHS

[Youko]
"Fellatio."

[Taichi]
"I told you, don't do that kind of stuff!"

[Youko]
"...you said not to have sexual acts, however fellatio is not included in that."
//The word can mean "sexual act" in general, but it is usually used for simple "intercourse". It's pure sophistry, hers, and so very Taichi-like. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Fella-chew is also a sex act!"
//Hakata-ben again? That's an odd way of writing fellatio, but then again, odd transliteratertiterationmanji--- "counter-romanizations" are the norm. It's odd enough that Cross Channel is on the third page of results. チー=7... somehow. -GHS

[Youko]
"...appendixes to rules are unfair I think."

[Taichi]
"Which of us is unfair here!"

Dammit, all my childseed had been extracted out.
//Nukitori is sort of what a nukige tries to do, after all. -GHS
Damn succubus!
Won't let me sleep all careless and inattentive!

[Taichi]
"Besides, there ain't nobody anymore, so isn't it just fine if you don't wake me up?"

[Youko]
"Just to be sure."
//Very interesting, and very vague. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What'cha come here for then!"
//This sounds odd to keep, but not as odd as the line here in the console version ("all tired straight after waking up..."), which already has a funnier version below anyway. -GHS

[Youko]
"...o-bento."
//Adapted. -GHS

She sets out a paper bag.

[Taichi]
"Whass'even with you coming here to deliver lunch and doing fella-chew, really? Hm?"
//Hakata-ben again? Same odd way of writing fellatio. Console version turns this formal. -GHS

[Youko]
"Somehow enough for two."
//See CCC0003A. Well now this is interesting. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You listening or not!"
[Taichi]
"...nah, naaah... preaching common sense to a person without common sense is pointless."

I was suddenly tired. That' because my vitality had been extracted.
//!FLUIDS! -GHS

[Youko]
"Have a report."

[Taichi]
"...'hat?"

I decided to change clothes.
//No one's listening to anyone or even responding to anything that even remotely resembles other people's actions. Welcome to the Internet. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ughhh, my underpants are all saliva and semen..."

I fling 'em off.
Being seen by her is not exactly embarrassing.
Or should I say, it's like whatever.

[Youko]
"I will wipe."

[Taichi]
"Eh, don't bother now... I can do it alone..."

Youko-chan's hands were grasping a bottle of lotion.

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha approach me within a radius of 2 meters!!!"
//Does he have a restraining order out on her now? Consistent with CCC0032, oddly enough. -GHS

Feet stop moving, on the dot.

[Taichi]
"...were you trying to give me a prostate massage?"

[Youko]
"No."

[Taichi]
"Were you trying to get revenge for my usual bullying then?"

[Youko]
"No."

[Taichi]
"Well then why are you even trying do all this stuff, you?"

[Youko]
"...because of love."

[Taichi]
"Ya LIEEE!!!"
//Ryugu Taichi RITAANZU -GHS

I repudiated her words while striking the pose of the nude adult male depicted on the plate portraying mankind and its history applied on that one man-made satellite.
//The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque doesn't actually portray the history of mankind, just has the people and origin information, and neither does its All Ages version, the Golden Records on the Voyager satellites. Taichi's talking out of his currently-naked ass. This sounds even weirder when considering the two return in Jintai. Somehow. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Did you attempt to make me a slave to lust via prostate gland massage?"
//He talks as if it would work... -GHS

[Youko]
"No."

[Taichi]
"Gah, damn this leopardess... unwilling to admit her sins!"
//Seems like a specific sexual pose on all-fours. Once again, Japanese never betrays my expectations of every word having a specific sexual undertone. Technically, since Youko is older, 'cougar' could fit but... more importantly, admission of sins makes more sense consider just how much Youko is actually refusing to concede, mainly that she's more scared than in love of Taichi. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Oh, whatever!"

I search for new underpants.

[Youko]
"Yes, here you go."

[Taichi]
"Hm."

I accept them.
I feel a chilly dread, yet uncaring I wear.
//Both dread AND the cold feel of metal -GHS

[Taichi]
"...eh?"

These underwear were made of metal.
Click, a sound as if locking from the direction of the ass.
I look over my shoulder, and there Youko-chan is squatting down and doing something.

[Taichi]
"What'cha even..."

[Youko]
"Lock... engaged."

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"What for?"

[Youko]
"So that it cannot be undone without key."

[Taichi]
"I mean why do these underpants have a lock?!"

[Youko]
"Because it's a chastity belt."

[Taichi]
"Cha-..."

Chastity belt.

[Taichi]
"Awww, I can't take it off?!"
//Regression to idiot -GHS

[Youko]
"No key, no taking it off."

[Taichi]
"Key!"

Assaulting.

[Youko]
"Gu-ulp."

Placed on the tongue and swallowed.

[Taichi]
"oH'whaaah?!"
[Taichi]
"What for, why?!"

[Youko]
"...last week Taichi was lewd."
//Maybe she's just read in the diaries... maybe she's already unreset. -GHS
[Youko]
"That... is not nice."

[Taichi]
"But last week I din'n't not but self-console!"
//STILL Hakata-ben. -GHS

[Youko]
"Not that last week."
[Youko]
"Regardless, unpardonable deeds are now conclusively restricted."

[Taichi]
"...I don't get you at all... but still the key... swallowed didn't you..."

[Youko]
"It's not removable anymore."

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna enema you, bitch."

[Youko]
"...that is fine, but right now I think it would be pointless. If you do wish to, please go on."
//Key's not in the digestive system yet, likely. Notice she has no problem with it. -GHS

I was caught.
This person here could maybe throw it up of her own accord.
Like that guy that threw up a still living goldfish that he had swallowed.
//TIL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish_swallowing -GHS
Caught in a trap.
Way too caught in a trap.
Made to be caught in a trap.
//See CCC0041. -GHS

[Youko]
"Be calm, my Taichi. There is a reason why you are wearing a chastity belt."
//See CCC0028: "My Kiri". Did he describe the sex scene to that extent in the diary? Maybe he still wrote 'my Kiri'... and maybe Youko just saw. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So there is a reason big enough that you necessarily had to go all the way to installing a chastity belt on a comrade-in-arms with whom you have shared joys and sorrows?"

[Youko]
"...this morning, I tried doing a bit of research."

The succubus speaks out as if not a thing had happened.
//Though technically she's answering him. -GHS

[Youko]
"I could not go to the power plant."
//See CCC0003A again. She's playing it awfully close to just have read about it... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Reason for the chastity belt."

[Youko]
"With that and the information at the hokora I was able to understand the outline."

[Taichi]
"Reason for the chastity belt!"

Youko-chan began rummaging in her bag.
I don't get this.

[Youko]
"Taichi, here."

I was handed over a bundle of brand-new notebooks.
//Her figuring out that the notebooks would vanish, too, is far too suspicious. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...the information and the items you have presented me now I just can't in no damn way connect with each other."

This is an excessively inadequate level of explanation.
//Oh YOU stop whining now. -GHS

[Youko]
"There is... much that is strange. Therefore, I would like to do a bit of full-scale investigation."
[Youko]
"...in the time where I am not guarding closely, chastity belt so Taichi will not do anything strange."
//Actually supposing this is why she didn't go to the power station. The question is why she goes to the hokora again NOW, and only NOW gets caught in the trap. She should have no need to know more than what she already knows, which from the above, is a hell of a lot. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh...."

Crestfallen.
Was that the reason then.

[Youko]
"But I will be back at noon."

Hence lunch for two I guess.
...somehow, Youko-chan's being active for the first time in a long while.
Somehow something happened perhaps.
But I haven't done anything in particular to 'stimulate' her.
//Sexual and non-sexual. -GHS
She pressed the lips against my cheek, then went out of the room.
