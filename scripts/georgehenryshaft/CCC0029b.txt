The club room.
I was wondering whether Tomoki was here, but it was deserted.
He's working hard at his 'club', I'm sure.
And if he is, right now he'd be downtown.
According to the notebooks, this world will last for just one week, therefore, all the efforts that guy makes will go to waste.
//He's dancing around the truth. So will Misato's, for starters... and his, most importantly. -GHS
But I could not bring myself to tell him that.
Because it didn't seem that Tomoki's club had a different meaning for him than Senpai's had for hers.
//At least he understands that the apparent goal is irrelevant. But like with the above, this also applies to him. -GHS
