On the hills I bumped into a girl.

[Nanaka]
"Kyah... owChChCh...! Where're ya looking when you're walking, ya scut!"
//Edo period insult (!), replaced with some more pear shakesin'. http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/shake_rule.html <- never leave your bookmarks without it. Nice etymology, too. Notice HE bumps into HER this once. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Guh... the hell is that, it's your fault, you're the one who wasn't looking dammit!"

[Nanaka]
"I've liked this ever since the first time I bumped into you!"
//HACK out -GHS

I am embraced.

[Taichi]
"AHEHHH! Progress is too fast!"

Never seen a more stereotyped high geeear!

[Taichi]
"...I'll just come out and ask, who'd you be?"
//HACK back -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Nanaka."
//So said Nanaka nanakaishly in a nanakan way. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nanaka... yeah, nice name!"

[Nanaka]
"Thank ye."
[Nanaka]
"Well, as for who or what exactly I am, we're awaiting for the investigation in progress."

[Taichi]
"Aren't you a ghost?"
//He remembers her. He knows who she is. Immediately. Where's the memory reset? -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ahhh, I think that's wrong, yes."
//She's an inner memory, although her role is closer to the Holy Spirit. -GHS

[Taichi]
"But the feeling I get from look at you is that you're sort of Spectric or something."

* Spectric = Ghostic
//This is probably better than the original, which is basically "ghostic = ghost-like". -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Wrong, yes. Unlike specters, I have legs."

[Taichi]
"Naaah... it's just... lately even the specters got some leg..."
//Hmmm, but aren't *western* bedsheet-ghosts that don't have legs? Well, "ghost KYARA DESU are hot too" works. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Well, as for who or what exactly I am, we're awaiting for the investigation in progress."

Discussion coercively averted.
//That's because he can only replay existing conversations with her. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...nah, we're fine."

[Nanaka]
"Then let me hand over to you my business card."
//HACK ~nanaca~ (yes, the thumb looks like that overbright) -GHS

I take it.
                JOB:   Next Generation Bishuojo
                NAME: ~NANACA~
                Your heart I! will! heal!♪
//Love how the last line of the image is basically unreadable, but this clearer reading is totally missing in the console version. Nice blue stripe, isn't it? It's the same that's on everyone's uniforms. It's all but the mark of Gunjou. Also notice Taichi's oddly long fingernails. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

Where do I even begin to straight-man this?
//HACK and out -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Hehe〜hn."

Nanaka might just have been proud of this thing.
//HACK NVL mode -GHS
      『Do feel free to fall in love with me!』
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
That is what her Fujiko-class face said as she sent a flirtatious sidelong glance towards me.
//Same kanji as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiko_Mine -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nanaka's misromanized."

[Nanaka]
"It's on purpose."
//Yes, yes it is. Although it should be nanOka. -GHS

Face goes serious in a flash. Anger's going through it.
//Hum, see Mimi vs. Mimimi. -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

Is she... dangerous?
For the me celebrate in his competence as a Young Adult, there is no atmosphere that I can't fully grasp.
And it was proclaiming,
//Ah, been a while. -GHS
that this girl was dangerous.
//Hum, another oddly off line removed in the console version. Continuing on this being just a better edit, and removing. Nothing's lost either way. -GHS
And yet... prodding the madman in front any further than this is in no way a good plan.
//Both ways. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You're like Ultra Kyute, but, what's your business?"
//See CCA0030. Miki talk... -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Welll, that thing earlier was sooo exhilarating yannow."

In an instant her mood corrected back to good.
It's a reaction peculiar to dangerous characters.
//And to people who were never angry and that you misunderstood for angry. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"That way that broad suffered in agony!"
//Curry may be Christianity, but Youko being brought to her knees by spicy... heh. -GHS

Giggling laughter.

[Taichi]
"You saw that?"

[Nanaka]
"Gave a glance."
[Nanaka]
"So refreshing!"

[Taichi]
"...then, Youko-chan... you hate her right?"

[Nanaka]
"She's a bad woman. Bleeech, she is, just bleeech."

[Taichi]
"I'm not sure I get where you're connected with Youko-chan..."

[Nanaka]
"Nowhere! We never met not once. She's just irritating."
[Nanaka]
"That's why this morning's felt sooo nice yes."

[Taichi]
"Ah, so that is what it is then."
//Formal...? -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Therefore, this week I graciously avoided striking you and making you tumble down."
//See CCA0023 (first time Nanaka hits Taichi), CCC3003, CCC3022, CCD0002. There's even the same damn kanji as CCC3003. Odd ruby text, there usually isn't on voiced lines (it's pointless, just listen).  -GHS

Huh, not struck and made to tumble down?
No clue what she means.
//LOLOLOL BECAUSE IT MEANS ZUBAAAN IS HIS BIRTH. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"She ain't good at all, no, that person o'er there."

[Taichi]
"...you're conveying me feelings of reeeal big hatred."

[Nanaka]
"Hatred you say, well you aren't mistaken."

[Taichi]
"So..."

How much does she even know?

[Nanaka]
"That broad... she even took my Taichi's first she did... that's why I..."
//IOW, Taichi was definitely a virgin. What the hell happened at the mansion under the Shinkawas, exactly? Notice also how Nanaka only ever really mentions Youko directly outside of Taichi. Ghost to ghost...? -GHS

She went gloomy.

[Taichi]
"First?"

[Nanaka]
"Ahhh, I remembered something bad. Ptui! Forget it!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, uhm."

[Nanaka]
"Palate cleanser!♪"
//HACK out instead -GHS

Pchk.

[Taichi]
"......!"
[Taichi]
"Wh-, what, why?!"
//HACK fade in now -GHS

[Nanaka]
"That's fine, that's not like that's the end of the world!"

[Taichi]
"Really, getting this oddly flustered... even this Competent Adult that I am..."
//...now he's Adult? Maybe the route progress does represent aging. Who knows how hold he is intended to be by now. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Well, about that broad, it's all whaaat-ever now."
[Nanaka]
"Taichi, please don't go get confused this earnestly now, will ya?"

[Taichi]
"Well, now... but no, I don't think I will."

Really, what is even up with this person here.
I can't fully feel the weight of her existence,
there is just no presence.

[Nanaka]
"Say now, today I'm a bit serious, yeah."

[Taichi]
"Huh?"

[Nanaka]
"And I want you to come to the hokora together with me right now."

[Taichi]
"What for? Rape?"
//Moege would be best, but a rape nukige is fine too! -GHS

[Nanaka]
"You wish!"
//It becomes less funny considering that Youko did, indeed, rape Taichi. And if both Nanaka and Youko exist only in his imagination... -GHS
[Nanaka]
"Nooothing of the sort, I'm talking serious. You know that hokora, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, sorta."

It's not some place I really wanna get close to, though.
Because that place is---
//Where the gate is, which he knows, since he remembered at the end of the last route. Well, it's a load, in fact what he's remembering now is that the hokora is very very very important. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Bit scary to do it like this, but... I want you to come with me."
[Nanaka]
"Because Taichi, you're so lax in your investigations compared to that woman."

[Taichi]
"That woman'd be Youko-chan?"

[Nanaka]
"...it's frustrating, but she's superlative."

[Taichi]
"Because she's just different even in the way she uses her brain."
[Taichi]
"Best not to think too much about those things."

[Nanaka]
"Is it now."
[Nanaka]
"Well, if you please! Keep me company a bit right now."

She joined my hand with hers.
