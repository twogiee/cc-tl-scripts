"Looks like I owe you some gratitude, Miki."

[Miki]
"Ehhh, it's fiiine, no biggie..."

But the Miki-chin we had here was fidgeting with expectations.
Sexual desire paints out the shame.
//Which connects to CCD0016A as in what his problem is. -GHS
In a sense, because I have my sexual desire, I am able to live undaunted by external pressure.
//A load of bullshit, given how emo he is. See Sakuraba, who actually can and is the exact opposite. -GHS
I take Miki's hands.

[Taichi]
"RABU MII TENDAA." (Love Me Tender)

Kiss on the back of the hand.

[Miki]
"A'waaah!"

In a lover's flutter, so to say.
//http://ameblo.jp/uchioji/entry-10889177411.html Japanese is sooo effing funny when the top search results for weird SFX are blog posts that boil down to "I pretty much got no clue". -GHS
Miki is weak to being treated like a princess.
Kiss, second time.

[Miki]
"But no..."
//Toukofication rate 90%... -GHS

No dislike at all, it seems.

[Kiri]
"......"

A horrendously strong pressure comes from Kiri.
I let a shower of kisses precipitate.

[Miki]
"Ohhhã€œ what lavish largess!"

I hug her shoulders.

[Miki]
"Fweh?"

I take her hair and apply my lips into them.

[Miki]
"It's like that movie... with that luxury liner..."
//See CCB2013. Toukofication rate 99%... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Love cubed."
//Vs. triangle? See CCA0015. Maybe this makes sense if I had watched Titanic, but I'd rather watch the Da Capo III anime again than that. -GHS

[Miki]
"I don't really understand, but the synergy seems amazing."

I approach my face to her cheeks from her back.

[Miki]
"U'hyah?"

But really, she doesn't dislike it at all, this girl here.

[Kiri]
"...grrrngh!"

The aura from Kiri takes more and more the aspect of something physical.

[Taichi]
"I might have perhaps become infected by Miki's charms."

[Miki]
"Ah, y-, you have?"

[Taichi]
"You have something in your eyelids, please close your eyes."
//Gomi's trash, but also 'the five tastes'. Why doesn't he try licking her eyelids? -GHS

[Miki]
"...yes."
[Miki]
"Thump thump."

Ah. Lips become stealable.
Change of plans.

[Taichi]
"Pchuuuh..."

[Kiri]
"That I will NEVER allow!!!"

I was swooped down on.

[Taichi]
"Wah, wah?"

[Miki]
"Kyaaah?!"

[Kiri]
"You molesterrr!!!"
//This is the sample used in Nanaca Crash. Odd, since it's one of the few times where he doesn't get zubaaan'd... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Gh'yaaaah!"

Netori fail.
