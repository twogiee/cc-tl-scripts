With manners nonchalant my hand extended towards the chest of this smiling girl.
//This script seems to be the major inspiration for CCZDXC. Pretty similar in format and contents. -GHS
Dunno why it's copypasta, since he's not going towards the chest. Intentionally confusing maybe. -GHS
Perhaps because it caught her unaware, Miki didn't make one movement as she stood there smiling.
Creeeak.
//This is read "kii" (pr0nounced "key"). -GHS
For some reason there was the sound of a door opening.
//BTW, in the 360 and reprint edition that sign's legible, so if you're wondering (...), it says "ろーか　はしんな", "no running in the corridors!". Though I'd totally translate that as Runn'nt in da CorridarZ because (looks left) (looks right) (ends comment here) -GHS
Verily, that, for the 2.5 Billion Males Walking the Earth (currently existing: three), it is the Neverlocked Door of Mystery.
//Unfortunately it doesn't seem to imply "three billion", just the three of them. -GHS
It is a territory worthy of being called a Sancta Sanctorum this, which is allowed to be peeked only by what is predestined to the misfortune of being stepped upon by all mankind, the ground and the floor.
But, while being that as well, it is also the entranceway through which all Cherry Teens must pass to become Young Adults who make binding of both the Bitter OR the Sweet.
//That 'or' is almost certainly intentionally wrong, as it combines Taichi's intentionally half-assed English with his bullcrap about Young Adults (that have tasted both bitter AND sweet). -GHS
That provided, this door is no tetragon, but rather a three-angled polygon (ULOL)
* ULOL = Taichian lolspeak. A subspecies of the common
  LOL, meaning an U.S. American style laughter.
  When Americans finish saying a joke (no matter how
  lame!), they have the truly strange habit of laughing
  by themselves. Because of this, their use of
  less-than-exceptional material does not appear as
  spontaneous, but rather as having a masochistic intent.
//インカ帝国はいいんか？ (untranslatable, and mercifully so) http://www.geocities.jp/sabu1117/samsam.htm This isn't exactly anti-American, isn't it. In fact, it makes Taichi sound even more foreign. -GHS

[Miki]
"...dammit."

Still smiling, the edge of her lips begin to twitch.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, alien hand syndrome, it just went on its own."

[Miki]
"No, it's my bad for having been careless."

[Taichi]
"Uhm, I shouldn't exactly be saying this but... that lingerie is veeery sexy innit. Onii-chan is hyyyper surprised. In a good sense."

[Miki]
"Much obliged. When will this hand finally distance itself?"

[Taichi]
"Th-, that, that underwear, pure and clean Miki, underwear, the delta, pure and clean, body has evidence, the color, gracefully enclosed, like this, that little kitten...!"

Thoughts come out in disorganized fragments.

[Miki]
"Sah! Since any further of this would be mentally dangerous, how about we let that be all?"

[Taichi]
"Nope, totally impossible. This hand is as if it were no longer a hand of mine, petrified as it got. Like a young child entrusted with the keys to home yet picking said home's lock, there is no possibility of simple interruption."
//Best guess it's about pussy (oh, really, no, you don't say), coming out of one -> latchkey kid, going back into another = picking the lock. Ergo, lockpick is now also a word for dick. You're welcome. See CCC0011C (maybe) -GHS
[Taichi]
"But still... really beautiful, they are."

[Miki]
"Ah, my appreciation for your courteous words. I would be happy if I could be granted your slow but steady distancing."

[Taichi]
"No Bishoujo Figurine could ever reproduce this vibrant vitality. Not even the skills of licensed teacher Sakakibara Kiyoshi, whose name is yet well-known in the Figurine community as a first-class molding expert, could do it!"
//Second appearance of Sakakibara-sensei (he taught Yusa's class). There's a good handful of readings for his first name, I went with this because it's the most typical. It's also nearly identical to kyoushi, which means 'teacher' (specifically of classrooms). Curiously, http://www.official.jimu.juen.ac.jp/teacher/j_kyo_info.php?j_id=730 - but I think it's unrelated. -GHS

[Miki]
"...I'll kill yah."
//HACK back a line earlier. -GHS

[Taichi]
"HyYyYyYy, what's with those serious eyes?!"
//Regression into bad translation. If blah blah ぃx7. -GHS

Those were the eyes of a hunter.
I distanced myself.

[Taichi]
"Ah, but, those are some extremely adult things you've come to wear, most assuredly."

I started speaking a little more politely than usual with her.
//HACK More serious Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"...yeah, well."

Miki grows a bit embarrassed.

[Miki]
"It's that, since there's no running water I cannot do the laundry."
//HACK doubty Miki -GHS
[Miki]
"If you go to the store they have new ones."
//That's a load. She's just poor, and likely pilfers them. Or maybe her mother just buys them, and she stole them from her. -GHS

And free of charge.

[Taichi]
"Therefore... you've brought with the sexy stuff you normally can't buy, right?"
//HACK ...with this doll change things work much smoother regardless. Without it, it's nowhere near clear enough that Miki understands her panties are sexy - just not that they're a sex aid. -GHS

[Miki]
"...yes."

Ohhh-key.
So, what to do, how should I tell her this?
Would it perhaps be best to leave it as is?

[Taichi]
"Ah, say now, Miki-rin..."

[Miki]
"Miki-rin I am. What is it?"

[Taichi]
"That underwear... I just sort of know about it, but,"
[Taichi]
"weeell,"
[Taichi]
"say now, those'd be sorta totally play underwear. Open Shorts, or Horny Shorts, they're called."
//HACK doubty Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"Well you see, sort of adult, yes, sort of plaything, eh, sort of underwear, yes..."
//girrrrliest -GHS

My fingertips bounce off of each other in the manner of someone aloof and easily irritated.
//Tsun-tsun. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Therefore... weeell so to say, there might be a slit in there around the secretmost parts so you can have sex without taking them off, yes."
[Taichi]
"It could be possibly said that this is a kind of shortcut!"

Raising the index finger, I show her a perfect-score smile.
And,

[Miki]
"............"

TrampleTrampleTrample!
She ran away.
She stays vanished in the toilet for one minute.
And she returns.

[Miki]
"Th-Th-This it's it's it's iiiit's?!?!"

[Taichi]
"I think that maybe you went for underwear procurement to Atomic General Store (formerly Kimura General Store), because they sell normal underwear and adult underwear side-by-side there."
//Line split -GHS
[Taichi]
"Say, isn't that just near that apartment building? Must be the lineup for the partners of those young wives!"
//Odd that Taichi wouldn't know that that's where Miki lives... maybe he's being sarcastic, i.e., the hint is that Miki's mother bought those for her husband, perhaps same with the elephant wear, and Miki just pilfered them? Miki's parents would also be pretty frisky. That, or see CCC4003: the hint may be that the shop still works. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It is my favorite shop in Kamisaka!"
//This seems intended to sound like a testimonial, so even if it's sooorta old-memeish this should work as intended. -GHS

Shining my teeth, I flicked out my thumb.

[Miki]
"uHYYyYY?!"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

She held down her nethers front and back tightly.
//ガッシ? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Calm down."
[Taichi]
"Though if you were to have a random encounter with a perverted molester while wearing that, things would become really problematic wouldn't they."

[Miki]
"F'WahWahWahWah!"
//4 dashes above, 4 'wa' here. -GHS

Continuing to hold her nethers down she starts rubbing her knees together with a nervous twitch.

[Taichi]
"...but then."
[Taichi]
"If Kiri-chin were to learn of this here, how would she react I wonder."

I smoked an Imaginary cigarette.
//HACK shocked Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"No, Senpai, you wouldn't?!"

[Taichi]
"If that neat freak Kiri were to learn of this, whooa!"
[Taichi]
"Would the Flowers break up?"

[Miki]
"Mewgooo?!"
//Catspeak. -GHS

She clings on to me.

[Taichi]
"...that Miki-Miki would wear something this perverted under her skirt. Filthy!"
[Taichi]
"Trading of boxed lunches would cease."

[Miki]
"But that's insaaane!"

[Taichi]
"Then you shall do what I say!"

[Miki]
"Only if it doesn't involve handing over my virgiii〜nity!"

[Taichi]
"Don't worry. So, this is my command!"

I place my hand on her head.
Miki gave a little start, but,
there's no hate.

[Taichi]
"Keep scrubbing."
//HACK surprised Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"...{ae}h?"
//Alternative: "I HAVE READ YOUR DIARIES, TAICHI" -GHS

[Taichi]
"No, I'll give you two possible selections."
[Taichi]
"Cleaning, or Mof Mof!"

[Miki]
"And Mof Mof is...?"

[Taichi]
"Well, Mof Mof would be..."
//http://vndb.org/v4965 yes, I checked that out, yes, I own a copy, yes, it's important. Because Cross Channel. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Yes, an act sort of like that."
[Taichi]
"You thrust the head in the space between left leg and right leg, then Mof Mof, Mof Mof..."

[Miki]
"That's heavy petting!"
[Miki]
"You can't just stick a cute name like Mof Mof to it! It's heavy petting!"

[Taichi]
"Wanna dooo it yeees, Mof Mof..."

[Miki]
"NoOoO! Mof Mof gets a nOOOooo!!!"
//ーx3+ーx5=8 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Being hated by Kiri, or Mof Mof! Outbreak of war, or maintaining the peace!"

[Miki]
"Yes, uhm, cleaning? Is cleaning not an option now?"

She holds up a hand with eyes full of tears.

[Taichi]
"Hum! You choose cleaning, then?"

[Miki]
"Cleaning... the normal kind of cleaning, right?"

[Taichi]
"Nope, the cleaning is no special thing, but, where you shall be cleaning... hoooh hoh hoh!"
//Noblewoman's laugh -GHS

[Miki]
"Chastity terminated."
//This line in the console version is Misato's "owatta". -GHS

Miki yielded.

[Miki]
"The wind is talking to me. The days of virginity are short, long though they appear. This day, in one step I will become adult. In a way that I absolutely did not wish for or expect..."
//See CCA0016. -GHS

She reads the narration for an Imaginary broadcast program.
//Because of all the radio stuff, specifying "TV" seems just erroneous. -GHS

[Taichi]
"That was a joke."

[Miki]
"Sob, sob... at least be gentle, pleeease..."

[Taichi]
"I told you it was a joke."
[Taichi]
"Come one, here's the mop."

I hand it over.

[Miki]
"...?"
[Miki]
"Mop playacting?"

[Taichi]
"You may distance yourself from the erotic."

Miki was still looking on in blank puzzlement.

[Taichi]
"Weren't you cleaning?

Bob, she nods.

[Taichi]
"Therefore, gladden me with a most prompt continuation of cleaning!"
//See CCC0026. -GHS
[Taichi]
"That is my desire."

[Miki]
"Ah..."
[Miki]
"Thanks."

I didn't do enough to cause her problems.
She struck down herself, then she raised back up by herself.
//Erroneous reaction to a pattern that was expected but did not occur, continuing the idea that this unreset Miki doesn't yet understand that Taichi's a variable, not a constant. This stuff'd have been so much more obvious if there'd been more choices... -GHS

[Taichi]
"You have authorization to fall in love with Kurosu Taichi here!"

[Miki]
"Petition nullified."

[Taichi]
"Goddamn it!"
