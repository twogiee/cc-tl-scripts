[Taichi]
"How about we go to the beach?"

[Kiri]
"...eh, to the beach?"

[Taichi]
"We'll invite Miki too. We'll go in trio."

[Kiri]
"...Miki too..."
//Awww, spurned. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Good, let's go!"

[Kiri]
"B-, but just up and deciding..."

I take her hand.

[Kiri]
"Kyah?"

[Taichi]
"Let's invite Miki and go."

[Kiri]
"But I didn't bring my swimsuit!"

[Taichi]
"Right next to Miki's apartment complex there's a general store, you'll get something there."
//THANK YOU Taichi, for avoiding us the horror of vertical stripes *shudder*. It's the best bit of character development in the game! -GHS

[Kiri]
"No asking what I want?"

[Taichi]
"Really you, I rescued you, so you can at least come with me on this one date."

[Kiri]
"D-, date?!"

[Taichi]
"A date with a flower in both hands."

[Kiri]
"...b-, but that means..."

[Taichi]
"Whatever, it's whatever GOOO!"
//See CCC3027 -GHS

[Kiri]
"Ah, wait, Senpai...!"

It was more or less coercive.
And then,
we drag out a Miki that had become neurotic in disheartenment,
//See her Sendback, really. One wonders what she was doing before finding the hokora. Certainly Kiri doesn't seem to be doing too well in keeping her in spirit. And one wonders if all the suspicious behavior in Week 1 was her not repeating... -GHS
we scraped up all we necessities from the Atomic General Store,
we procured a car,
and we headed to the beach.
//No accidents...? Giving Miki Sendback, does this mean that Kiri can drive??? -GHS
............

[Taichi]
"Great, nice beach style we got!"

Triumphant pose.

[Taichi]
"And now!"
//See? THAT is how stripes are done! Teach her, Miki! Teach'er gooooood! -GHS

[Miki]
"...ngggh."

[Kiri]
"...mnnngh."

[Taichi]
"Aaah, nice, niiice!"

We had bodies of moderate puberty here that yet could pass off as ones of the Pure and Innocent category.
//Sort of weird. Seems to mean "I'm hot and Miki and Kiri are loli." Or it's more of those Three Gay Sisters who look like Rape(suspicious pause)seeds. -GHS

[Miki]
"Somehow... I feel gazed at."
//Might be just Youko. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I feel that too..."

[Miki]
"Anything happens you protect me, OK?"

[Kiri]
"Sorry, that might be impossible."

I looked fairly decadent in my repeated bodybuilder-worthy poses.

[Taichi]
"Well, shall we play?"

............
//In this scene they're playing a game without explaining much of the rules so it's a mess to understand. In other words, it's a metaphor for what happens between the three. Naturally, I knows the Tanaka: it's a mix of volleyball and water gun play; ball is served, and the side that makes a receive can fire their water gun until the other side makes a receive. It's 2 vs 1, so once eg Kiri makes a receive, Miki can fire too. ...maybe. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah, ah, ah, Kiri-chin, ball I said, the ball!"

[Kiri]
"Impossible, impossible, that's impossible now I told you!"

[Taichi]
"Soh'ra, I shall get your hair wet!"
//With the water gun, see the pool scene (Kiri doesn't like it) -GHS

[Kiri]
"Stooop!"

[Miki]
"Ahhh, the ball's coming dooown!"

[Kiri]
"Told you it's impossibleee!"

[Taichi]
"Whoa!"

[Kiri]
"Ah, a chance... e'yh!"

[Miki]
"Ohhh, sharp ooone!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah tch-tch-tch!"
//Chasing the ball? -GHS
[Taichi]
"D'owah?!"
//Struck by the water gun fire? -GHS

[Kiri]
"...pffft."

[Miki]
"Ahahahaha, Senpai, that's your second fall in a rooow!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, I was hit!"
[Taichi]
"Your turn to serve now."

[Miki]
"Yeees, here I gooo! T'eaaah!"

[Taichi]
"Shootdown!"

[Miki]
"Ah, good one!"

[Kiri]
"Leave it to me... s'oreh!"

[Taichi]
"Oh, nice one!"

[Kiri]
"This is two versus one, we will not lose!"

[Taichi]
"But once I make a proper receive...!"

[Miki]
"Precision fire〜!"

[Taichi]
"wAbgh!"

[Miki]
"Annnd hit!"

[Taichi]
"Wait, with this one how much actual damage I got?"

[Kiri]
"...three points to go now."
//Hum, but Taichi fell twice before, and this one's the third, so it could just be their advantage. -GHS

[Taichi]
"No waaay..."
//Still keeping this is a sorta-Yutaka reference. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Well, here comes the serve."

[Taichi]
"Oooh, that's an earnest throw!"

[Miki]
"Peeew!"
//Gunshot -GHS

[Taichi]
"Come on now, no real attacks until the first receive!"

[Miki]
"Ehhh, I'm not attacking! I just mimicked the words with the mouth!"
//To distract him -GHS

[Taichi]
"That's cowardly!"
[Taichi]
"Soh'ra, receive! Attacks begin!"

[Miki]
"Hyoh'tto!"
//Pretty similar to CCA0008 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Tsk, she dodged it!"

[Kiri]
"Soooh'reh!"

[Taichi]
"Ah, that arc's bad..."

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin, combination attack!"

[Kiri]
"Ohhhkeeey!"

CIN 1 0 0 160 0
CIN 2 320 0 160 0
CR 0

[Taichi]
"Wah, wah, wah... soh'ryah!"

[Miki]
"Woaaah, he dodged them aaall!"

[Kiri]
"...he's like a monkey."

[Taichi]
"I'm gonna get going tooo! Come on, if I make a receive you lose the right to attack!"

[Miki]
"Ah, sorry!"

[Taichi]
"Once I receive, I will be attacking whoever goes to make the catch! Sh'yah! Clean swee〜ep!"

[Kiri]
"Kyah, wait Senpai! We cannot accept that rain-like drizzle as a proper attack!"
//Because of below, gun might be drizzling water everywhere? That or he's fired in an arc and it's falling on then from above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mgh... battery wore out... I guess?"

[Miki]
"Heh heh heeeh, we have been firing in alternation, so we still got lots and lots of attack power left!"

[Taichi]
"...yeee-es, that I would've that handicap I've known aaall along!"
[Taichi]
"If I can't attack, then pure volleyball alone will be enough!"

[Miki]
"...what?"

[Kiri]
"Cocksure isn't he."

[Miki]
"Yep, waaay cocksure. Alllway like this."

[Kiri]
"But that's just bravado isn't it."

[Miki]
"Yep, just an ostentatious show-off he is."

[Taichi]
"Come ooon, don't talk smack about someone in front of theeem!"

[Miki]
"He stopped, snipe attaaack!"

[Kiri]
"Snipe attaaack!"

[Taichi]
"Uwaaah!"

[Miki]
"Team Mikiri wins!"

[Kiri]
"...O.K.!"
//Also very Yutaka. -GHS

We enjoyed playing of a High-Level combination of beach volley and survival game.
//Miki and Kiri distracted Taichi as he was about to win, then double-teamed him to death. And that's all you get to understand the above. -GHS
And then lunch.

[Taichi]
"Wheeew... making the playfield out in the sea made me sooo tired."

[Miki]
"Miki is as weeell!"

[Kiri]
"Here I am."

Kiri had come back.

[Kiri]
"The gas still works, so I could get a bit of a fire going, thankfully."

[Miki]
"Ahhh but is it right to just up and use the House on the Sea like this?"

[Taichi]
"It's fiiine, look at the times we live in."

[Miki]
"...ahhh, I don't really want to think about thaaa〜t!"
//That could be about the lack of everyone. Or it could be that she doesn't want to play the 98 game anymore. After all, it's still very possible the House on the Sea is simply closed down. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Senpai, please do not bully my Miki!"

[Taichi]
"...is she yours now?"

[Kiri]
"In deed! I will not give her away."

[Taichi]
"But half is mine!

[Miki]
"...my body is being split into territories as if I was some defeated country..."
//Miki's some part of Africa after all. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I will not concede that."

[Taichi]
"Hand 'er oveeer!"

[Miki]
"Waaah, it huuurts!"

[Kiri]
"...ah."

[Taichi]
"Weeee, it's mine!"
//Tone fits better with 'it' -GHS

[Miki]
"No, Senpai, that right then was Kiri-chin's victory."

[Taichi]
"Whyyy! I won the tug of war didn't I?"

[Miki]
"Seeing a child in pain as she is pulled left and right, Kiri-chin let go... and that kindness is the love of the true parent!"
//And after the game, specific Biblical references. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Sho〜ock!"

[Miki]
"And therefore, Kiri-chin being victor means..."

[Kiri]
"...yes, whatever, can we just hurry up and eat? It'll get cold."
//Because they're Japanese. -GHS

[Taichi]
"So what, it's cup ramen and canned food and rice cakes, come ooon."

[Kiri]
"Please do not ask for extravagance, this is all perfectly unobjectionable."
//They're having crappy food at a House on the Sea. That's totally not what typically happens in Japan. -GHS

[Miki]
"That's what an House on the Sea is about: ramen!"

[Taichi]
"Isn't it."

[Miki]
"Ah, by the way, Kiri, what about 'that'?"
//Why would they have plans to take over the world (mwahahahah) if Miki is reset? -GHS

[Kiri]
"Mh?"

[Miki]
"Erm, that's..."

She gives a glance my way.

[Taichi]
"Is that something you don't want heard? Or could it be that you want to confess your love to me?"

[Both]
"We do not."

[Taichi]
"...those harmonics piss me off."
[Taichi]
"Should I just leave?"

[Miki]
"Ah, it's no problem."
[Miki]
"...meow."

She meowed.

[Kiri]
"Nyeeeh."

[Miki]
"Purr-meow-purr."

[Kiri]
"...nyaa nyaa."

[Miki]
"Mew!"

[Kiri]
"Naaago!"
[Kiri]
"Nyan nyaka nyan?"

[Miki]
"Meeeow..."

[Kiri]
"...mnyan?"

[Miki]
"Mee-eow..."

[Taichi]
"C-, Catspeak?"

Miki and Kiri were meowing with nyans and meows.

[Taichi]
"Ah, aWahWah... scaaary!"

Shortly afterwards,

[Miki]
"Right. A day ends fast."

Arms folded, nodding yes-yes in agreement.

[Miki]
"...cooome on! Don't tell him!"
[Miki]
"Ah, shorrye."
//Trash + sorry??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"That thing there was communication?!"

These Pretty (virgin) Gyarlz have constructed their own proprietary language system?!

[Taichi]
"T-, teach it to me too!"
//He should know of their plan, even if they're normally (perhaps always) revealed Sunday, so he's asking to learn Catspeak. -GHS

[Miki]
"...'s impossible!"

[Taichi]
"Why?"

[Kiri]
"...because you're not catlike, Senpai."
//Well, he's a cat that he thinks he's a rabid rottweiler; but at best, he's a poodle. More interestingly, he does think himself possibly catlike, especially with the eyes; Kiri casually dismisses it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I am so catlike!"

[Miki]
"Ehhh, what paaart?"

[Taichi]
"Well then, look here!"

I cover my eyes,
Shutter click---

[Taichi]
"Look, my eyes shine in the dark!"

The House on the Sea we are in now is sufficiently dark.

[Miki]
"Woaaah, so nostalgiiic! Look, look, Kiri-chin, it's as he says you know?"
//He told her before, see CCC4012. Though she does sound like she's seen him change them. -GHS

[Kiri]
"That's true... they shine."
//He just put on his contact lenses, didn't he. -GHS

[Taichi]
"This can be said to be ample qualifications."

[Miki]
"...inexplicableee!"

[Kiri]
"Are those contact lenses?"

[Taichi]
"Absolutely not. All natural. And I can switch back and forth as I please."
//Of course! Contact lenses are toootally not something that people lost in chuuni use! And if his hair isn't exactly natural, since he got it after the Hasekura massacre... -GHS

I close my eyes,
Shutter click---

[Taichi]
"Normal mode!"

[Miki]
"Woooh, kewl!"

[Kiri]
"Kewl... I guess?"

[Miki]
"And with those you can really see in dark places, right?"

[Taichi]
"Yup. Got sharp night eyes."

[Kiri]
"Catlike."

[Taichi]
"Really, it was an unexpected abnormality for me to become catlike. Doctor said that."
[Taichi]
"If I had been unlucky, I might've just lost eyesight all the way from childhood."
//Still not impossible that he has. Certainly, the pattern in his eyes suggests a serious potential birth defect. But that is eyes would still have selective sight is very much true. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...so that's how it is."

[Miki]
"Ah, gotta toilet..."

She dashes out like a little kid.
//This is too specific to SFXize. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...me too toilet."

Snatch!

[Taichi]
"Bwoh?"

[Kiri]
"......peeping is out of the question."
//Now she does the same Miki does in CCC0011C -GHS

[Taichi]
"Grrr."

............

[Taichi]
"Still, Miki looks OK now."

[Kiri]
"...taking breathers is truly necessary."

[Taichi]
"After all, Miki's not really lacking in basic emotions."
//Another oddity, see CCC4022. -GHS
[Taichi]
"She's not an Unexpert, she's nearly at the level of a healthy person."
//See CCC4009. Curiously, despite her having emotions, she says her problem is that she can't understand other people's. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I think the disappearance of people would take its toll on her, absolutely."
//This is a mess, since if Miki's simply playing at Taichi's game, then the tears she has at the start of the Youko route and her Sendback would be fake... OTOH, her having a serious reaction at the idea of the vanishment of humanity, however not real, is equally telling of how much her problems are solvable. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...that is just something we can do nothing about."

[Taichi]
"You not lonely, Kiri?"
//Ouch. That scene was replayed not long before. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I'm... how should I say..."
[Kiri]
"Malice has gone away, but... but."
[Kiri]
"..."
//And now she answers, as far as she can at least. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right. The hearts, the minds of people like us are something that only begins to come to be if there's pressure from the humans around us. Stuff like this is... bad of course, yes."
[Taichi]
"It's a dilemma."
[Taichi]
"Without a heart, a mind, a spirit, a person's just a beast. But... once there is a heart, there's all sorts of problems."
[Taichi]
"It's way too delicate, this human heart of ours."

[Kiri]
"...I would have preferred to be living... normally."
[Kiri]
"But... we've been pushed into this valley between the mountains... like we were the ones at fault."
//Religious subtext now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...well, there's nothing we can do about it."
[Taichi]
"After all, rebels that reach that level where they hurt people have started turning up."
//レベル rebel/level. Egh. This is as bad as the benches' light in CCA0002. Possibly a reference. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...that is true, but..."

[Taichi]
"But I think you're a good girl, Kiri."
//A good point to note that, so far, Taichi hasn't called her Kiri-chin outside of copypasta. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...g'boh!"
[Kiri]
"A-, all of a sudden blurting out weird stuff..."

[Taichi]
"Your head looks like it's going all puffy, Kiri."
//Google term -> "Powa powa is not Japanese and therefore has no meaning, go ask whoever said it." http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q1472914069 -> sob. -GHS

Kiri holds down her head.

[Kiri]
"Eh... it is?"
//I suspect the point is that she just believes everything he tells him, the moron. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Can I touch?"
[Kiri]
"...please do not touch me with perverted feelings, OK?"
[Kiri]
"I will know if you do."

Will you now?
I rub her head.

[Taichi]
"...it's not all puffy. It's all fluffy!"
//Variant of Fucking Fuwa Fuwa. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...I cannot understand the difference..."

[Taichi]
"Well, regardless, do your best!"

[Kiri]
"Eh... at what?"

[Taichi]
"The world is full of malice, but I'm certain that there must be a dominion in there for you, Kiri, that's what."
[Taichi]
"...one that you won't need to take by force by waving weapons around. That dominion."
//Referring to what they were trying to do with their secession thing. -GHS

[Kiri]
"???"

[MikI]
"Aaah, it looks like you two've reconciiiled!"

[Taichi]
"We're getting along well, yeah."

I hugged her.

[Kiri]
"Kyoh?!"

'Kyoh'?
//Unpreparedness? Torchlight? ...tubular nectary??? That last term, in particular, pretty much googles to きょ -GHS

[Miki]
"Jealoushee!"
//Engrish -GHS

Kick and wriggle and struggle.

[Miki]
"And it's even a complicated Double Jealousheee!"
//She's gelatinous of both. -GHS

Kick and wriggle and struggle: continued.
//see CCB2019 -GHS
And then she leaped inside.
//See CCC4012 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wah!"

[Kiri]
"Wah!"

[Miki]
"Purr-meow-purr♪"

Spinning round and round she flattens against us.

[Taichi]
"Being clingity-cling'd like this is making me aroused so stop iiit..."
//... -GHS

[Miki]
"Clingity-cling!"
//...... -GHS

[Taichi]
"C'mon-c'mon!"
//............ -GHS

[Miki]
"Slurpy-slurp!"
//........................? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Cut it ooout!"

[Kiri]
"Stop it this instant!!!"

[Taichi]
"Aaah, too late..."

You underclasswomeeen!
//Okinawan -GHS

[Kiri]
"G'hyaaah?!"

[Miki]
"Me-, metamorphopsis?!"

[Kiri]
"NOOOOOOO!"
//yA + 6xー = 7 -GHS

[Miki]
"MEEEEEEEOW!"
//7xー (tricky) -GHS

[Taichi]
"...t-, this is the five-story pagoda you two have erecteeed! Take your responsibilityyy! And it's a perfect job, look, not one single naaail!!!"
//Seems to mean "built so well it can stand together without needing to be nailed together". -GHS

[Miki]
"That was so fuuun!"

[Taichi]
"Indeed. Let's go again."

[Miki]
"Yeppers!"

[Status]
mostly returned to good spirits.

[Taichi]
"Ah, those pictures you took today, how long would it take to develop them?"

[Miki]
"Do you want them quickly?"

[Taichi]
"Yes. If possible before tomorrow night."
//What does he do with them? Maybe he keeps them in the hokora. To be burned by Youko and lost forever. Maybe he's just repeating the pattern. -GHS

[Miki]
"So soon... then, I'll be developing them at school, and I'll deliver them to you there."

[Taichi]
"Thank ye. Bye-byez!"
//Nanaka's goodbye -GHS

[Kiri]
"Bai bai!"

[Miki]
"Bai-baaai!"
//unsure what case or situation she is talking about -GHS

Miki ran off towards the apartment building.

[Taichi]
"I'll see you home, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"...thanks."

[Taichi]
"Nhhh, I'm so hungryyy."

[Kiri]
"Do you have anything to eat?"

[Taichi]
"Ah, I do, I do. Lots and lots left in the Tomoki Box."
//The Tomoki Box is a good source of protein. Except, of course, that this is a plot hole if Tomoki's been sent back, as he should have been. Whoops. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...uhm... could you drop by?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

[Kiri]
"To my house. I will get some dinner ready."

[Taichi]
"That's a really nice service innit."

[Kiri]
"...uhm, there is something I would like to talk about."

[Taichi]
"There is something you want to ask me, right?"

For an instant, Kiri stopped even breathing.

[Kiri]
"...yes, there is."
[Kiri]
"I want to inquire about Yutaka."
[Kiri]
"I want this made clear... otherwise... I cannot understand what feelings I should have for you."

[Taichi]
"Right. Hmmm..."

No, Friday is way too soon.

[Taichi]
"Theeen tomorrow, how about that, no good?"

[Kiri]
"Tomorrow, is it."

[Taichi]
"I'll tell you everything. Around noon's fine, so I'll come by 'round then."

Yes, everything,
and honestly.

[Kiri]
"I understand."

[Taichi]
"See you at school."

[Kiri]
"Yes, Kurosu-senpai."

Well-mannered and courteous. So Kirish.
She straightens up.

[Kiri]
"Thank you very much for everything today. I will be taking my leave."

As if we were in some sports club.
//Well, it's nominally a sports club... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yup, bai-bai."

And so we parted---
//Saturday September 12, 1998 -GHS
It's Saturday.
...one more day.
There is one more day.
I showed my face in the classroom, but only Miki was there.

[Taichi]
"Annnd Kiri?"

[Miki]
"Ah, good morning to you too. Kiri-chin's not here yet."
//Looks sarcastic -GHS

[Taichi]
"Right."
[Taichi]
"The photos, did you get them done?"

[Miki]
"I will be developing them right nooow."
[Miki]
"Reprints are 5,000 yen apiece, so mind you."
//Currently sitting at 5,250 yen. If only the terms were similar that'd be damn close! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Thiiief!"

[Miki]
"Ah, let's all eat lunch together!"

[Taichi]
"Yeah."

And so I ended up waiting.
............
It became noon.

[Taichi]
"...s-, so damn late those two!!!"

I'm so hungryyy.
Should I just eat alone then.
Today we have rice balls.
There's furikake mixed in, and it looks really tasty.

[Kiri]
"Good morning, Kurosu-senpai."

[Taichi]
"...you're late!"

[Kiri]
"Eh... but you said that noon would be fine, Kurosu-senpai."

[Taichi]
"Did I now?"

It feels like I did...
//MEMORY HUNTER. More interestingly, hunger (like exposure to panties) seems to have an impact on his memories. Perhaps all physical urges do. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I came to inquire on that topic."

[Taichi]
"Well, for now let's dive into some eatery."
[Taichi]
"Come on, there's around enough for two here."

[Kiri]
"Yes... then, thank you for the food..."

[Taichi]
"Thank you for the food."

Munch, munch.

[Taichi]
"You doing alright with Youko-chan? She's not being nasty to you is she?"

[Kiri]
"..."

[Taichi]
"She is, is she?"

[Kiri]
"...when I left home, right on the door..."

[Taichi]
"Right on it?"

[Kiri]
"...'filthy sow' was graffitied on the door."
//See CCB2014. So gelatinous. PS2: "baka". No, I don't think so. -GHS

[Taichi]
"She a kid or what..."
[Taichi]
"That all?"

[Kiri]
"For the time being."

[Taichi]
"Well, as long as you don't do anything she won't be doing anything more than that."

[Kiri]
"...how come that person is so skilled at stone throwing?"
[Kiri]
"That is weird, very much so."

[Taichi]
"She's great at almost anything!"
[Taichi]
"Her fundamental capacity of doing seems just different."

[Kiri]
"Did she get some special training?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, she did indeed. Every lengthy vacation period she goes to some foreign country and hires a local military instructor."

[Kiri]
"Military...!"

She's at a loss for words.

[Taichi]
"She learned stone throwing in one of those occasions I guess. Might even be that she learned it from real-deal shepherds."
[Taichi]
"Still hurts?"

[Kiri]
"...not particularly."

[Taichi]
"I am very glad of that."
[Taichi]
"I expect there's been lots and lots of other stuff."
[Taichi]
"It feels like her life is almost entirely used for self-training."
[Taichi]
"I'm a competent martial artist myself, but I couldn't hold a candle to her."

[Kiri]
"What kind of martial art do you practice?"

How wonderful that I was asked!

[Taichi]
"It's called Karade."

[Kiri]
"...I do not know it."

[Taichi]
"Eh?!"

[Kiri]
"Is it some plagiarism of Karate?"

[Taichi]
"...ngh."

I fight a want to shout at her back with desperation.
//See CCC3019 -GHS
This is the first time I stay silent on hearing a comparison with Karate.

[Taichi]
"Kiri-kun... should ye be attacked by aliens, the only one who could rescue you is me, get it?"

[Kiri]
"Do aliens even exist?"

[Taichi]
"That problem is but a trifle. That's sidestepping the point."
//That's nearly the exact answer Nanaka gave Taichi when Taichi diverted from talking of God, see CCA0003. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Also, she might also be capable of using firearms."

Kiri blinks in surprise.
Excessively quick change of topic perhaps?

[Taichi]
"In hand-to-hand, if it comes to grappling, I think you might just get killed in an instant. She has knowledge of lots of techniques, and lately, she purchased this really expensive knife."

[Kiri]
"...but then... no matter how you put it, it's all about the killing..."

[Taichi]
"Says the one who wanted to kill me herseeelf."

I poke her cheek.

[Kiri]
"...kohof, keahf!!!"
[Kiri]
"W-, was my killing intent that obvious!!!"

[Taichi]
"It's fiiine, it's fiiine. I'm forbearant so I'll forgive you."
//Ironically, right now, he is. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I think it's normal that you would hate me."

[Kiri]
"..."
[Kiri]
"I do not get this anymore... honestly."
[Kiri]
"My life was saved, so I cannot do anything anymore, nor do anything to change this situation."
[Kiri]
"But... still I don't really... right now, Senpai, you... uhm... I can't say this well with words but... it feels like you are desperately doing all you can..."

[Taichi]
"...truly, yours are discerning eyes indeed."
//Mystic Eyes of Seeing People For What They Are (except, well, unless they're clouded by sechs or stuff). -GHS
[Taichi]
"You go work in Human Resources in the future!"
//...I'll just refrain from commenting. -GHS

I slap her shoulders, paf-paf.

[Kiri]
"...before, you were much more hedonistic, or should I say, you felt rather unpleasant, and now..."
//Told you his problem is his Penas. -GHS
[Kiri]
"You seem to be different in some parts now, Senpai."

Dear dear, the conversation became serious.

[Taichi]
"...naaah, I just can't fail."

I scratch my head.

[Taichi]
"If I were to reset, I would then still have this will to go and live more pleasurably."

At the word 'reset', Kiri's gap between the eyebrows grows slightly tighter.
//She never comes close to that part of his Settei after all, but it may be she heard from Miki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I'm just fed up with all that stuff, you know."
[Taichi]
"And of my tiny, weak heart as well."
[Taichi]
"I really hate myself, I do."

[Kiri]
"...hate yourself?"

[Taichi]
"And for a reason similar to the one in your feelings, Kiricchi."

[Kiri]
"But that's..."

[Taichi]
"Yet, I have found one single method of settling this. Or more like, it's a last resort, there."
[Taichi]
"...and for that... I... in the end, everybody, I..."

I look at the sky,
a blue sky that seemed like it would become even bluer.
//This sounds so like "a sky that seemed about to disappear", though. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...uhm, did Yutaka---"

Yutaka, right.
That is something hard to answer.

[Taichi]
"Well, and with that said, let's have friendly fights from here on."
//See CCA0030 -GHS

I interrupt her, and extend my right hand.

[Kiri]
"...y-, yes."

Flustered, Kiri extends her right hand as well.
//She didn't know which one Taichi would extend. -GHS
Handshake.
The handshake is a sign of peace.
//A handshake is something you do to people you meet, and even anime watchers will notice that it's something awkward to do in Japan. The idea of handshake as a sign of peace, however, is part of the ritual of the Catholic mass. This hints that Romeo Tanaka is specifically Catholic. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Then, this is party to celebrate the arbitration of an armistice."

[Miki]
"Prowcurement compleeete!"
[Miki]
"...whaaah?"

[Taichi]
"Thanks for your work."

[Miki]
"You're eating already... and it looks delicious too."

[Taichi]
"I invited her."

[Miki]
"...liaaar... and when I finished developing the film for you, Senpaiii!"

[Taichi]
"Thank you for your hard work!"

[Miki]
"Bwoooooh!"

Miki went into an impassioned harangue over this bitterly heartrending betrayal.
//I know she just roared, but I think the joke is that the word means both a lion's roar and an harangue. And if I used roar, then I'd have to translate the line above to "uryuu" for reasons that are too obvious at this point to even specify. And I sort of refuse to do that. -GHS

[Miki]
"Well then, what do we do with this giant pile of foood?"

Miki let the contents of her tote bag fall, paf-paf-paf in rapid succession, on top of the desk.
It became a mountain that spilled off the edge.

[Taichi]
"This is less food and more like junk food."

Seriously this girl here...

[Miki]
"Teheh!"

[Kiri]
"...where's canned food and the rest?"

[Miki]
"It was all gowne!"

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh. Using junk food in the stead of a proper lunch... that looks nasty."

[Miki]
"You think so?"

[Taichi]
"Terrible for the health, too."

[Miki]
"But Miki really likes sweets!"

[Kiri]
"Me too, but my stomach's full, so..."

[Taichi]
"Sorry, me too."

[Miki]
"...awww!"
[Miki]
"Well then, I'll eat them alone!"

Sullen.

[Kiri]
"...you'll get fat."

[Miki]
"..."
[Miki]
"I'll still fatteningly love sweets!"

She sets out to eat potato chips.
That's the single worst product for your pretty face, you know.

[Taichi]
"But inside yourself this annoys you, doesn't it?"

[Miki]
"But buuu〜t..."

[Kiri]
"Don't cry now..."

[Taichi]
"C'mon, I'll give you this onigiri!"

Because it's been made to adult male size, it should be just fine for Miki-chin.
//Or PCP. Dunno. -GHS
It's not that much for me, but... ah, it's fine.

[Miki]
"Aaah, it's handmade coooo〜king!"

Hug!, she clings to the hand that's holding the onigiri.

[Taichi]
"Want sooome? Ehhh?"

I hold it aloft.

[Miki]
"Ah! Do want it!"

[Taichi]
"Allmost almost!"

To the right.

[Miki]
"Awwwuuu〜"

[Taichi]
"Upppy uppy!"

To the left.

[Miki]
"Uwwwaaa〜"

[Kiri]
"...that's bullying."

[Taichi]
"...here."

[Miki]
"Aaah, dewichious!"

Chomp chomp she sets to eat,
while the mountain of sweets is left untouched.

[Taichi]
"...for being girls your eating habits seem unstable. Is it always like this?"

[Kiri]
"Sometimes it's canned food, sometimes it's bread."

[Taichi]
"Eat your vegetables."

[Kiri]
"We have none."

[Taichi]
"Here, tomatoes. Just two of them."

[Miki]
"Aaaah, tomatooo〜es!"

[Taichi]
"Ehhh? Want sooome?"

[Miki]
"Sooo want!"

[Taichi]
"Allmost almost!"

To the right,

[Miki]
"Awwwuuu〜"

[Taichi]
"Upppy uppy!"

to the left.

[Miki]
"Uwwwaaa〜"

[Kiri]
"......I knew it, this guy's... just a bully."

[Taichi]
"Sigh."

[Kiri]
"Mhhh〜〜〜!"

[Miki]
"Souuu〜r!"

[Kiri]
"But delicious..."

[Miki]
"Feels I'm crying!"

[Kiri]
"We're living it up here."

[Miki]
"Myaaa〜wh!"

While looking sidelong at Miki and Kiri's mouths go 『＊』-shaped via tomato eating, I quench my thirst with my canteen.

[Taichi]
"......"

She's looking, yep, she's looking.
Seriously this girl...
She's just a big clump of jealousy isn't she...
Her showing herself to me is the same as suspecting me... this is an insinuation.

[Miki]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Well... we are being monitored with the Intelligence Technique of the Ichihara Style."

[Miki]
"Ichihara?"

[Taichi]
"A spy technique imparted by a group of resourceful Kunoichi, led by E. Ichihara... but there's no point giving it any thought."
//PS2 version keeps Ichihara, but censored(?) "potato chips" to "snack food" above. No comment. -GHS

[Kiri]
"KYAAAAH?!"

Did she see?

[Kiri]
"Senpai! Se-, Senpa--- it-, it's it's..."

[Taichi]
"You're fine, you're by my side."

[Kiri]
"...y-, yes..."

[Miki]
"Eh? Eh?"

[Kiri]
"It-, it's..."

Kiri points. Miki looks with a 'what?'.
Youko-chan's figure is not there.

[Miki]
"...eh? There's nothing there, whass'it?"

[Kiri]
"N-, now, I'm sure that... Senpai?"

[Taichi]
"It's the Shimura Feno--- Phenomenon. Miki is no longer physically capable of observing Youko-chan."

* Shimura Phenomenon---
Taichian Physics. A type of observational problem
that occurs within specific, stable situations.
The observer looks, but the unseen subject has
its Still Unseen Attribute fixed, which reflects
on the physical world. Frequently, a drastic
change in the situation causes this attribute
to be lost.

[Kiri]
"...ngh."

Nervousness comparable to death.

[Taichi]
"It's alright, it's all right. Just trying to psych you."
//No word on who. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Let's ignore that, OK? Just ignore."

[Kiri]
"Yes... I will give it all. I am skilled at ignoring."
//Technically she's terrible, which is why Taichi can't stop overdoing things with her. But if she's good at ignoring, then her pretending there's no humanity shouldn't be too much of a problem. -GHS

[Miki]
"Then after meal let's have sweets!"

So she'll eat them after all?

[Kiri]
"Uhm... Kurosu-senpai."

[Taichi]
"What."

[Kiri]
"But there is crying..."
//No mention of who, again. -GHS

"Don't mind it!"

"It's just acting. Don'tcha be fooled. Just like a robot has no human heart inside, neither does Michael... I mean, neither does she have a human heart."
//See CCD1001. I suspect it only means that Michael Jackson can turn into a robot and uhm she's a robot and uhmmm this is lame, though silly in its own way. See CCC0026... maybe? -GHS

[Youko]
"............"

Uh-huh, her sight does hurt.
//And then the scene ended, with nothing happening. -GHS
And then it was the time for the talk with Kiri.
As Miki flatly left us an opportunity, I was expectedly approached.
//Been a while. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well then, shall we go."

[Kiri]
"Ah, then, please let me go to the toilet first."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, then I shall also visit the toilet, yes."
//Girly... -GHS
[Taichi]
"...sigh."

This is the moment of truth.
If I don't earn her trust...

[Youko]
"Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...it's you."
[Taichi]
"Being cooperative, are you."

[Youko]
"Am I?"

[Taichi]
"You came to hold me back, to prevent me from going in the toilet on the other side, right?"

[Youko]
"...yes."

So honest.

[Taichi]
"I'm going to reconcile with Kiri, you don't have a problem with that?"

[Youko]
"What you are doing is a waste, I think."
[Youko]
"But, if that is your wish, then... I can't do anything."

Can she now?
Is that even her real intent?
//Amazing that Taichi can't read her at this point - when she explicitly said she wants him and Taichi to be alone together! -GHS

[Youko]
"As it seems something is keeping her long, stay here five more minutes."
//Her period, see the bathroom scene. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...I ain't going there."
[Taichi]
"I went all this trouble to preserve this stability, and I don't want to just tear it apart."
[Taichi]
"Also... I would prefer not being flashbanged."
//...he talks less as if he has read, and more as if he just remembers... -GHS

[Youko]
"..."

Her smile seemed sardonic.
The original Hasekura Youko, that every once in a while she shows.
That a human this ferocious could be born...

[Taichi]
"And while we're there, if I don't say this I'll just can't help feeling uneasy, so I'm sorry, but,"
//This one literally couldn't be helped! Insane. -GHS

[Youko]
"...'don't meddle', right?"

[Taichi]
"Yep, sorry."

[Youko]
"I won't. I will lend necessary support."

[Taichi]
"...right."

[Youko]
"So nice that you're getting your hands on memories, Taichi."
//Very creepy, considering her sendback. -GHS

Her figure vanishes,
her presence erases,
her existence disappears.
//And rub it our face in it s'more, will ya. -GHS
One of the movement techniques this elusive phantom possesses lets her achieve the sudden materialization at any place, at any time, like some god or demon.
//That's just what Elusive Phantom reads, going for visuals on this one. -GHS
You just aren't a human anymore---
Into the first years' classroom.
Take and deep breath,
and let's deceive!
//The public. And himself. Certainly not Kiri. Hell, definitely not Kiri. -GHS
And then---

[Kiri]
"...I have been waiting."

[Taichi]
"Yup."

I stopped and stood on that spot.
This is the distance between the two of us,
and I cannot shorten it now,
for Kiri might just end up rejecting me.

[Kiri]
"First, a brief one from me."
[Kiri]
"I used to think of you as a filthy rotten murderer."
//See CCC3023 -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Kiri]
"Yutaka's... murderer."

Her features are peaceful.

[Kiri]
"The day Yutaka died I was looking in the rooftop."
//She never says WHY, does she? Jealousy for her onii-chan is not impossible, though. -GHS
[Kiri]
"And then, I saw the talk between Yutaka and you, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"......"

Freeze not, my rationality.
...and sink back, my violent emotions.
//He's about to got accused of being a murderer about a guy he was genuinely conflicted about; that's not unexpectable. -GHS

[Kiri]
"And then Yutaka died."
[Kiri]
"At the beginning I didn't realize. But later... you, on that rooftop..."

It's about what happened that time, then.

[Kiri]
"That's why I didn't want to be involved with you in any way."
[Kiri]
"But... there was involvement from you."

Kiri's eyes both had perplexity in them.

[Kiri]
"...and therefore here were my thoughts. That you... well... might just be someone who devours the hearts of people, maybe."
//Now that he says it like that, it sounds silly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uh-huh."
[Taichi]
"...wrecking people's hearts, and so satisfying my cravings... that's what you mean, right?"

[Kiri]
"...indeed."

Eyes quiver in anxiety.

[Kiri]
"And... the eyes you look at me with."
[Kiri]
"At that time, they made me shudder in horror."
//What could Taichi's parents leave behind that can change someone who's more of an animal than a human into a nice guy? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yup... I guess they would've."

Sharp one she.
Consequently, the mere living in the world of people will be painful.
The mind, the heart, they get polluted in the blink of an eye.
It's the sharpness that drove this girl into Gunjou.

[Kiri]
"But now, I don't understand you. Your true form... no, even what state you are in Senpai..."
//Sharp enough to recognize the change, at least. -GHS
[Kiri]
"Could it be that... could it be that you, right now..."

She sinks her hand outside of the window,

[Kiri]
"...but I have no other way except this..."
//See CCC3004. What was Taichi's lie again? -GHS

dragging up,
a cloth parcel.
//Hmmm, so Miki would still give her woman-spec to her (hurr hurr hurr) -GHS
She removes the cloth and,

[Kiri]
"I am sorry, if you wish do please resent me."
[Kiri]
"And now, the truth, please."

[Taichi]
"..."

Youko-chan, please don't move in,
that was my desperate prayer.

[Taichi]
"If at the conclusion, and only then, you pull the trigger then it's fine. That's a privilege you have, Kiri."

I will accept that,
for I, still, do want to devour Kiri.
//See main route: what devouring? He'll do the same here. It's all intent, isn't it. -GHS
I will pay the price.
Well then, Kiri, I'm putting my life at stake.
Come at me with full force, my Kouhai.

[Taichi]
"The cause of Yutaka's death was suicide."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"But the cause of that was me."

We sink into a silence without end.
And then,

[Kiri]
"...please continue."

First stage's clear, then.

[Taichi]
"It's a tale that'll run long though."

[Kiri]
"Talk, Senpai."
[Kiri]
"And with that, please set me free."

The antagonism, or the leniency:
which of the two will we end at?
//See CCC3027 -GHS
Kiri's mind will likely accept only either of these.
Wetting my throat with saliva, I began to speak.

[Taichi]
"There was this family called the Hasekuras, long ago."
[Taichi]
"They had a big house. Western style. So big it was about ten times Kirihara's house."
[Taichi]
"Those guys were multi-billionaires."
[Taichi]
"I was... well, when I was a child my mother passed, and I was taken into their custody."
[Taichi]
"I was a live-in worker there, for a manager and his wife who were distant relatives of mother's."
[Taichi]
"It was a family with old customs, you know."
[Taichi]
"The children of servants were made servants, seriously."
[Taichi]
"I was just a child, therefore, my duty was to be sort of a playmate for the children of the family."
[Taichi]
"Youko-chan was the youngest girl there."

[Taichi]
"Not especially."
//There's no contradictions here: he tears himself down, ergo he largely brushes aside the bad parts of his background. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Lies..."

[Taichi]
"Well, that's enough about me. Right now the subject's Yutaka."

[Kiri]
"Ye-, es..."

She wipes her tears.

[Taichi]
"The son of S, then... well..."

There is no point in beating around this bush.

[Taichi]
"Mmmh... Yutaka, that's who he was."

[Kiri]
"............"

She stopped,
together with the shake of her hands.
Of course, this is not her having calmed down.
She parts with colors to the point of pitiability,
and gazes at me, fixed.

[Kiri]
"...wh-, what did you say...?"

Half smile.
She is unable to keep even emotions under control.

[Taichi]
"Let's take a break."
//He's just trying to be nice; it's not really that needed. It's not like she breaks or anything in CCC3026. -GHS

I sat on a chair.

[Kiri]
"...eh... what?"

While listening to Kiri's puzzlement,
I did not speak in the slightest.
............

[Taichi]
"Feeling better now?"

[Kiri]
"...yes."

Slowly, sluggishly, Kiri stood up,
and not with the weapon already pointed.

[Taichi]
"Have questions?"

[Kiri]
"...Yutaka... then, Senpai, he...?"

[Taichi]
"It's the truth."
[Taichi]
"Well, maybe it was the atmosphere to blame. Little kids aren't exactly capable of opposing their fathers, right?"

Kiri holds down her mouth.

[Taichi]
"Yutaka's misfortune was to have that kind of father after all."
//Let's see, what else starts with S... Starsky? Spendthrift? Satan? Ohhh... indeed, his father was The Devil(tm), and now he's reborn in Jesus. Like a peanut planted and bearing a persimmon tree. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...that's something I have heard... rumors about the people of the Shinkawa... but... but!"

[Taichi]
"It's exactly as you said, Kiri, in this world there is far too much malice."
[Taichi]
"Yutaka was one of its victims."

[Kiri]
"But... I have never heard that story before anywhere. We have always lived together, and he never talked about that---"

[Taichi]
"Memory loss."

Kiri's lips closed tight on the spot.
Certainly even Kiri would've known of how Yutaka had memory loss.
All the parts inside Kiri that had been abandoned to a state of ambiguity came together in a single stroke.

[Taichi]
"Also, I know what caused the guy's leg injuries too."

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Because I was there."

[Kiri]
"...then... Senpai... you knew he...?"

[Taichi]
"Nyope."
//NYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYANYA. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I never thought that Yutaka would still be around... I forgot the very name Yutaka."
[Taichi]
"...meeting him was a coincidence."
[Taichi]
"At the time I was also forced into girls' clothing so... looks like there wasn't any recognizing from the other side either."
[Taichi]
"So well, lots of complications and I was set free... there were lots of twists and turns and I ended up here."
[Taichi]
"Thinking back, it's just natural, isn't it."
[Taichi]
"There was no way that that wouldn't break our spirits, nor for me nor for Yutaka."
[Taichi]
"I wonder if us meeting was just inevitable."

[Kiri]
"...I'll never believe this!"

[Taichi]
"I recognized Yutaka after we got close."

[Kiri]
"...that's why... you murdered him?"

[Taichi]
"It's not like I immediately fired into some murderous rage."
[Taichi]
"It was just a thing of the past."

[Kiri]
"But then... why?"

[Taichi]
"I thought, if he's in pain, I'll let it go."
[Taichi]
"But when he was hanging around with me, he seemed to be happy."

[Kiri]
"...!!!"
[Kiri]
"That day... you asked me... was he happy...?"

[Taichi]
"You remember that, good."

I smile.

[Taichi]
"That's right. That was what it meant."
[Taichi]
"And from that, I judged Yutaka as being happy."
[Taichi]
"This was never stained by resentment."
[Taichi]
"Just... I felt like I wanted to peck at all his faults, so so very much."
//This is not necessarily meant negatively. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...ngh..."

[Taichi]
"It was a nice clear sunny day."
[Taichi]
"As you did see, that moment we talked about everything."

[Kiri]
"...ngh..."

[Taichi]
"And then he asked: how can I make you forgive me?"
[Taichi]
"It didn't feel like there was blame then."
[Taichi]
"...just, there was one thing unclear."
[Taichi]
"So I asked him a question:"
[Taichi]
"Say, I got one question though... why don't you just die right this very instant?"
//They didn't even bother to put Yutaka there? Boooo! -GHS
[Taichi]
"...and that's what I asked."

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"And then... that guy killed himself for real."

Kiri crumbled down.
That feeling of wanting of to approach close, and whisper it.
Hold it in---
//What keeps being the change here is what Taichi feels about these things; Kiri doesn't react much differently. In fact, she's even MORE into him now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I had no resentment."
[Taichi]
"But... the idea of him having been one of those for whom attacking people was as if healthy... I could simply not accept that."
//He's got more of a problem with being friends with a bully who claims repentance than with having been bullied. And it sounds like Tanaka knows the feeling very personally. -GHS
[Taichi]
"And whether Yutaka was or not... I... truly..."
[Taichi]
"If there was no resentment... then I wish I had left things as they were... that's what I think, now."
[Taichi]
"If Yutaka were still alive... maybe, just maybe, I would've become better, just a little."

[Kiri]
"Aahhhaaaaahhh...!"

Wailing as if the tears were being squeezed out.

[Taichi]
"He had become a nice guy, that one... it's just that I was too broken."
[Taichi]
"However much I patch up my exterior looks, I'm... the monster you said I am, Kiri."
[Taichi]
"That is why it's hopeless."
[Taichi]
"That is why... I..."

My heart is not crying,
tears do not come out.
I cannot tolerate that part of me.
No.
I have decided not to tolerate it.

[Taichi]
"Sorry, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"Waaahhhhhhh, wah, Aaaahhhhh!!!"

[Taichi]
"At that time, in that abnormal mood, to preserve his self Yutaka couldn't but devour something weaker than that self, me."
[Taichi]
"And next after that, I made Yutaka my food, my prey..."
//Try 1 Peter 3:9 instead. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Me and Yutaka devoured each other, Kiri."

[Kiri]
"...!"

Kiri clung to me.
Unconsciously... I ended up hugging her.

[Kiri]
"I'm sorry..."
[Kiri]
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
[Kiri]
"I'M SORRRYYY..."

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha apologize. That's not the problem..."
//See CCD1001. No point in her apologizing to him any more than Misato to Taichi. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Please cry... in my stead."

And her voice grew even louder.
My home.
In this space, always so lonely, today there blooms a flower.

[Taichi]
"Well, come in."

[Kiri]
"S-, sorry for intruding..."

After that, Kiri had come to my house.
//She always liked him, and only ever had the problem of Yutaka between him and her love. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Whoa..."

My room was a lover of chaos and disorder.
Guests were usually astonished.

[Taichi]
"Gladden me with sitting."

[Kiri]
"...where would I even sit."

[Taichi]
"Here."

I pass the Tonbo mud rake.

[Kiri]
"...here, you say."

[Taichi]
"Make space in whatever place you want to sit."

[Kiri]
"............"

At her own risk and responsibility,
Kiri sits in an awkward seiza in the gap made by the tonbo.

[Kiri]
"...men..."

[Taichi]
"Wait up here a biiit."

I fly down to the floor below and bring tomatoes back.

[Taichi]
"Here, vitamins."

[Kiri]
"...thanks."

Timidly and hesitatingly, she gnaws into the tomato.

[Taichi]
"Feel free to relax!"

[Kiri]
"...yes."

[Taichi]
"Then, you said our conversation has to continue, but how?"

[Kiri]
"With compensation."
//See? She'll do this whether he goes all down on her. That crap about Devouring is largely in his mind. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Compensation?"

That's something I have expected, but...

[Kiri]
"For what Yutaka did, and furthermore for my inadequate treatment of a Senpai, including today's attempted murder."
[Kiri]
"...the police might not be anymore... but I think you should decide, Senpai."
[Kiri]
"My share and Yutaka's."

[Taichi]
"In other words, you will grant me two wishes."

[Kiri]
"...I am fine with however many wishes you have."
[Kiri]
"This will not make the sin disappear, however."

[Taichi]
"But sin's not a problem anymore, really."

What Yutaka and I had was friendly fire.

[Taichi]
"Right then... for starters, there is one thing I want to ask of you."

[Kiri]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow, early morning... I want you to come with me."

[Kiri]
"...yes, I understand."

[Taichi]
"Questions?"

[Kiri]
"None. I will obey."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."
[Taichi]
"Well, we will be climbing the mountain, that's all."
//See CCC4009, she doesn't like it -GHS

[Kiri]
"The mountain?"

[Taichi]
"Yeah, we went there for the training camp didn't we? We're going at least that far up."

[Kiri]
"Yes, understood."

I did it!

[Kiri]
"Is there anything else?"

[Taichi]
"Eh... else?"

I didn't think about this.
What do I do?

[Kiri]
"Anything will be fine."

[Taichi]
"...theeen."

I come near to her lips,

[Kiri]
"...?!"

A Deep & Longtime would be dangerous, right. The water level lowers.

[Taichi]
"And with that, I've had a feast."

I distance our bodies.

[Kiri]
"Ah, uhm, uhmmm?"

[Taichi]
"Don'tcha think about it too deeply, OK."

[Kiri]
"Bu-, bu-, but!"

[Taichi]
"It's fine. Anyway, with that my wishes have come true! Awesome! Me Bishoujo Killer. Me 'maaazing, so kewl, so stylish!"

Cooldown.

[Taichi]
"...I'll be sleeping. Leave."

I get in bed.

[Kiri]
"...Senpai!"

I'm taken by the arm.

[Taichi]
"Tomorrow, come by at six o'clock and wake me up."
//Odd, since he has an alarm clock and there's no way the batteries would run out in a week... and it's usually set for 10AM on Sunday, right? And he usually wakes up at seven anyway. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...if so... then I will be staying here."

[Taichi]
"Really you! I got these circumstances me..."

[Kiri]
"...you stupid person."
//NOW she's a sharp judge of character. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Nh... nnh?!"

This time it had come from Kiri.
//Sunday September 13, 1998 -GHS
And then, morning---
I was awake.

[Taichi]
"...Kiri?"

She's not here.
But definitely, that last night...
//Always left vague. Maybe cut sex scene, maybe not. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Good morning, Taichi-senpai."

[Taichi]
"...'Taichi-senpai' now."

[Kiri]
"It's, I was thinking about breakfast, but I couldn't do much about it..."
//She can cook, there's nothing in the house. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, don'tcha worry 'bout that."

[Kiri]
"There were some potatoes however."

[Taichi]
"Whattity, there was something that nice?"
//Damn Nanakese. -GHS

I had a feeling there would be.
//Spoken as if they weren't in the diary and he actually remembered. See CCC0035A: not the first time. -GHS

[Kiri]
"I only steamed them, however."

[Taichi]
"...hoooh, hooh-hooh."

Suddenly my hunger awoke.

[Kiri]
"Salt as you please."
//See CCB2002, truly the reverse of that. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yup, let's eat!"

We have a mountain of potatoes.
//Kiri gets lots of fog puns, might as well get some for poor Yamanobe. -GHS

[Kiri]
"That was delicious."

[Taichi]
"Yup, tasty. They were cooked through."

[Kiri]
"If there were still butter, it would have been better, but, of course..."

[Taichi]
"Whaaat, but soon you'll have as much as you want to eat you know."

[Kiri]
"Eh... how could that be?"

[Taichi]
"Ah... uhmmm... well, lots of reasons."

[Kiri]
"???"

[Taichi]
"Whoooa, I ate oh how I ate!"

[Kiri]
"I made effort, but the quality was what it was."
//Literally it means "NOOO TENTACLE RAPE!", like every single line in Moon Rune (all translations are just stuff made up by the translators). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, this is bad, we gotta get ready!"

[Kiri]
"...ah, we should go to the mountain."
[Kiri]
"I will pack these up, then."
//Leftovers. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, let's go, let's go, this is a clothes- on-your-back-only tri〜ip!"

[Kiri]
"Huh..."

[Taichi]
"On that regard... you didn't think of any other questions?"

[Kiri]
"...well, I did not think of any."

[Taichi]
"Don't stress yourself too much. Sin, after all, is merely a concept."
//Not in the slightest what he treated sin so far. Remember that Taichi's doing something he himself doesn't understand. He doesn't, still, even at the very end. He doesn't even care to. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Saying this might just make you angry, but..."
[Kiri]
"...I am... a little bit happy."

[Taichi]
"Happy?"

[Kiri]
"Because you thought that Yutaka was your friend, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"...ahhh."

[Kiri]
"The two of us were always giving it all at school, together."

[Taichi]
"Weren't you two like alter egos?"
//Sorta random change of subject... -GHS

[Kiri]
"Yes, exactly."
//...but she keeps the pace. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hmmm, and because Yutaka was no more... that's why you've become Alter Egos with Miki."

[Kiri]
"Yes."
[Kiri]
"...but is it not unfair to do this?"
//Possibly have sex despite Miki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It ain't. Well, not that my guarantee is worth much."

[Kiri]
"But, well..."

[Taichi]
"Come on, up the mountain, up the mountain! Let's go!"

[Kiri]
"Oss."
[Kiri]
"Say say, Senpai."

[Taichi]
"Hmmm?"

[Kiri]
"...I was thinking I may just want to become a love slave."

[Taichi]
"Bft!"

I burst into laughter

[Taichi]
"You lost your mind or something, Kiricchi!"
//See CCA0015, though the term's different the mirroring is evident. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Is restraint that necessary?"
//http://thesaurus.weblio.jp/content/%E3%81%91%E3%81%98%E3%82%81%E3%81%8C%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81 one of those sentences that means nearly the opposite of what it literally does. -GHS
[Kiri]
"And, Senpai, you were always going 'love slave, love slave' yourself, right?"
[Kiri]
"You should have no objection."

[Taichi]
"I do, I do, those were jokes!"

[Kiri]
"I am inexperienced, however, I look forwards to working with you."
//It's still left vague what exactly they did last night. -GHS

[Taichi]
"You won't be working with me!"

[Kiri]
"Ahah!"

[Taichi]
"...you were just making fun of me right?"

[Kiri]
"No, that'd be absurd."

[Taichi]
"Huh... as soon as we get to a spot where we can take a breather I'm bullying you again."

[Kiri]
"Go on!"

[Taichi]
"I'll be flipping your skirt!"

[Kiri]
"Go on!"
//She's finally learned Taichi's Rules: he's attracted by the defiance, not the acquiescence. Give in to him and he goes away. Very nearly the opposite of a bully. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Uhmmm... it'll be the Frisky Prank Full Set!"

[Kiri]
"Go on!"

[Taichi]
"...really now, Kiri!"

[Kiri]
"Go on, whatever it is!"
[Kiri]
"...am I not good, then?"

[Taichi]
"It's not that you are not good enough or anything, just... it's that I'd become less than good enough if I did."

[Kiri]
"Eh...?"

[Taichi]
"And also, if I wanted that sort of stuff I'd already have one person."

[Kiri]
"Ah... Hasekura-senpai..."
[Kiri]
"Uhm, between you, Taichi-senpai, and Hasekura-senpai... how..."

[Taichi]
"I'm just being stalked, I am."

[Kiri]
"Is that a problem?"

[Taichi]
"A very big problem too. I wanna chase her away."

[Kiri]
"...so, how about that?"

[Taichi]
"That what?"

[Kiri]
"I will the one to drive her out!"
//Works whether she's real or not: Alter Egos with him would mean her chased out, regardless. She's offering to help him with his own problem. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...come now, come now, that gal's a way too diffi-cult religious issue... you could never cross swords with her, Kiri-chin."
//Oh God the puns. Not an original one (it googles and to bad puns), but yeah, she's a religious problem due to ZOMG TEH SATAN's. I'm sparing the 太一 taichi/太刀 tachi because of various mixed choruses of jeer at how obvious it is. -GHS

[Kiri]
"We will have intensive training. I'll be learning all kind of things."
//http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell likely what is meant here, given all the manga/anime/VN tropes in session. See Miki route: she could nearly take Taichi if focused and pissed off. And see CCX0001: all of Taichi's skills were built in a single week! She can totally take Youko, even if she's real. See CCC3012A, where she rejects the mangalike Nakama instead; has Kiri understood the rules for interacting with Taichi at long last? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Impossible... her Stalker Skills are way something else!"

[Kiri]
"If I'm to be a love slave, then let us have a contest of love."
//~3P~ -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hmmm, but you're so fainthearted and timid, Kiri... I think it would be difficult, yes."

[Kiri]
"...eh... that is not..."
//I think even this Kiri would cringe once things move to scat. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And even then, it'd just be dependence in my regard, right?"
//Meaning if she replaces Youko, as Taichi wanted to do with Yutaka to Kiri, they'd be off in the same problem. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......"

[Taichi]
"It'd be fine, but I'm not a good guy, Kiricchi."

[Kiri]
"...then, what I can do... to find a place where I belong..."
//Stop on these fingers, these fingers of mine, and I'll whisk you away together with those fingers, to a forbidden forest where the cicadas cried and no translator apparently knows what 'akazu no' means so they keep writing 'unopenable' or 'untouched' or other nonsense FFS even an MT can do better. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I have some idea about the place you belong to, Kiricchi."
//And the religious sermon begins. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It's the place you'll be going towards from now on."
//Heaven. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Now on...?"

[Taichi]
"Look, we've arrived."

[Kiri]
"...that's a shrine, isn't it?"

[Taichi]
"Well, the thing itself is whatever. C'mere, this way."
//Of course. It's not in the stone itself. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...but... there's nothing there?"

[Taichi]
"Put this in your pocket."

[Kiri]
"A radio? OK..."

[Taichi]
"Well then, Kiri... I will be observing from here, so could you walk straight that way?"

[Kiri]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"That way, straight and forwards."

[Kiri]
"Are you sure...?"

[Taichi]
"Slowly now. Please stop at the spot I will indicate."

[Kiri]
"...yes?"
[Kiri]
"S'looo'hly slo'ly, then."
//Now she's copying Taichi with horrible translingual puns...? Sorori means slowly and quietly, but it's clearly nearly-pronounced the same. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bit more ahead."

[Kiri]
"About here?"

[Taichi]
"Little to the right!"

[Kiri]
"Is it here?"

[Taichi]
"Yeppy yep."
[Taichi]
"And forward power five-zero."
//Quote from Farewell Yamato launch sequence. Using from official English dub http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT90dijxyk8 (near the end). The translation seems dubious at best, but it's a few decades too late to complain about it. BTW: the original title is "Saraba, Yamato". -GHS

[Kiri]
"Whoa, I don't get it... is that 'slowly'?"

[Taichi]
"And right there stopp'!"

[Kiri]
"Yes!"

Good, spot's okay.

[Kiri]
"?"

If I switch my eyes now...
//Confirming that the procedure requires him to 'switch' his eyes... to UV sight. That doesn't make sense at all, regardless of how it's impossible. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And now, Kiricchi..."

[Kiri]
"Yes?"

[Taichi]
"A place where you belong."

[Kiri]
"Eh? What do you mean?"

[Taichi]
"A place where you belong, Kiri! Go and seize that place where you can be yourself!"

[Kiri]
"A place where I belong?"

[Taichi]
"We talked about it right? How hearts, minds fight each other."
//See CCD1001. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Huh?"

[Taichi]
"But you, because you're too delicate and far too sharp, you can see all things far better than most people."
[Taichi]
"With those eyes you will find the one you like, I'm sure."
//~Mystic Eyes of Boyfriend Finding~ -GHS

[Kiri]
"Hahah... thank you very much!"
[Kiri]
"But I already have one I like!"

[Taichi]
"Naaah... you'll have to find one after this."
[Taichi]
"By the way, I'll be sending you Miki later on."

[Kiri]
"Eh?"

[Taichi]
"It can be painful, and it can be outrageously unjust, and it's malicious."
[Taichi]
"But there's joy and sorrow, mixed together and alternating one after the other."
//Let's go with both. Them's the truth, after all. -GHS
[Taichi]
"The world of people is far better than a world of absolute Nothing."
[Taichi]
"Do you get that?"
[Taichi]
"If you do, give it your best."

[Kiri]
"Senpai? What's been all this?"
//Well, he says such things? But small honeypots must be split by glossosynthetical meat poleaxes with ultracrepidarianist fleshly cum. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Of my meetings with you, this will be the last one, but,"
//This technically doesn't prevent passing by each other, does it... -GHS
[Taichi]
"I will put the memories I received from you to use, with gratitude."

[Kiri]
"But I don't understand what that means...?"
//Predictable joke here. -GHS
//That was so predictable I forgot what it was. -GHSomeTimeLater

[Taichi]
"I will pray for your struggle to be successful!"

Salute.
The look of unease in Kiri's facial expression increased rapidly.

[Kiri]
"What... do you...?"
[Kiri]
"What are you even trying to do?!"

Faster than Kiri could run back to me,
came that brilliant scarlet red.
And then,
Shutter click---
I Observed.
I closed my eyes, and on opening---

[Kiri]
"What are you even trying to do?!"
//BTW, there's no way that Taichi can know any of these things, yet narration never transitioned to third person, ever... except for these parts, as well as CCE0001. Of course, it's easy to find an explanation: either Taichi hallucinates, or he knows because he's seeing them. -GHS
[Kiri]
"...my?"
[Kiri]
"Eh... Senpai? Where's...?"
[Kiri]
"Senpai! Senpai, I say!"
[Kiri]
"My... he's nowhere... my?"
[Kiri]
"...the town... eh?"
[Kiri]
"There's... people?"
[Kiri]
"The radio... it's receiving..."
[Kiri]
"There's a radio signal?!"
[Kiri]
"What is this...?"
[Kiri]
"Senpai! Senpai! Senpai! Senpai, Senpai, Senpai, Senpai!"
//She's juuust this close to Toukoin' it up, by the way. She's more dangerous to him than viceversa. She needs to be away from him more than he from her. Senpai x7 -GHS
[Kiri]
"Haaah... Taichi, Senpai...?"
[Kiri]
"...he's not here?"
[Kiri]
"You're kidding me, why..."
[Kiri]
"He's gone away...!"
[Kiri]
"...I don't... understand this..."
[Kiri]
"aaaaaAAAAAAAAH!!!"
//8xー -GHS
[Kiri]
"AAAAAAAAAAH!"
[Kiri]
"Haah, haah... why... uwAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaH!!!"
//Counting the 'a' in Wa, it's a total of 3x7= 21xあ in these three. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
[Taichi]
"It's better like this."
[Taichi]
"KIRIII!"

Just in case, I try to call her.
//She's still standing like right next to him, of course. -GHS
Naturally, however, there is no reply.

[Taichi]
"Yup."

I alone am able to Observe,
the many worlds that overlap without end on the same axle.
//Each of which... is a person! Dun dun dunnn, here's how the "only notice what they want to" people become parallel universe de-facto, without even considering of course the many worlds of narrative, and, of course, Earth and Heaven. And of how this makes no sense whatsoever scientifically! -GHS
That is why Kiri exists right next to me,
however reciprocal perception is impossible.
//See CCB0015B. He has known this all along, further hinting that this has always been metaphorical. And it is, it's just refusing to see... which metaphorically becomes the impossibility of being connected in the 'wrong' way that Taichi, and most people, demand. -GHS
We are living in the same world,
but whatever we do we can never become connected.
The instant I observed, reality was fixed.
//Shimura Phenomenon... close, but not quite -GHS
No,
all possibilities exist on the same axle from the very beginning.
It's a question of whether there was someone to see them, or not... that and nothing more.
//This sounds plausible, but it's actually nonsensical. It would only work if the observer somehow decides which possibility he sees. IOW, it's real only assuming Taichi's just deciding whether he sees or not as well as what. -GHS
Well then,
I once again await the moment.
I return to camp, and get in the tent.
//He's just camping out his evenings at the hokora. Odd, but given Mutsumi's always out, and he's not hurting anyone, there's no reason for him not to be allowed that. -GHS
It is time.
I'll sleep and wake up and then...
               See you next week---
