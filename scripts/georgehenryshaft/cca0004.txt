"Morning...?"
//Monday September 7, 1998 -GHS
//Previous scene is dream/flashback. -GHS

I got off the bed,
in my room of no unusuality.
//Contrast room in the Hasekura Mansion. -GHS
I stop the annoying wail of the alarm clock.
//Say goodbye to it, for it will never ever be heard again. -GHS

[Taichi]
"fWah..."

It's the beginning of September, as opened by Summer vacation.
//A hideously pretentious way of saying "the first week of September was vacation". Although September is the ninth month, http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=September etymoloy of the English/Western words for it make it a 7. Translingualism continues. -GHS
The Summer heat slowly leaks out from inside the room.
//Because Summer is ending, or because of Heat Death of Parallel World - not necessarily because his window is open. -GHS
Sluggishly I change into the uniform, sluggishly I take the bag in my hand.
//No mention of the Taichi Bag. -GHS
On top of the dining table lies a sandwich in a plastic wrap,
a sandwich with eggs, lettuce and potatoes.
//Seems like a single one, no paper bags of them, nor lunch, nor a note. Very off-pattern. Of course: it hasn't gotten Fixed yet. Pretty impressive how this being obviously older writing still fits seamlessly into the plot without needing (much of a) fanwank. -GHS
I appropriate it with humble thanks.

[Taichi]
"Munch."
//I'm not certain of the relative legislation, but it might be illegal in some countries to use a SFX for eating other than "nom". If this could cause issues let me know; it's not because I don't want people arrested for owning illegal SFX, just to come laugh at you for being arrested for living in places where possession of certain SFX is a crime. -GHS

Delicious, as typical.
//These are intended to be Youko's. Or are they? -GHS
To this me so incapable of managing my own life, this supply drop is the good news.
//THE good news, AKA the Gospel. Byble gameZ11! -GHS
I needn't assault a Kombini on the way to school now.
//TL Note: if you made it this far without knowing what a Kombini is, ask whoever installed the patch for you. He's probably the guy moving the mouse for you and reading this stuff and explaining to you every word veeery slooowly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"For food always so delicious, my sincere thanks."
//Not what I will use, but since it'd be redundant... -GHS

I bowed my head towards the East, hands hailing towards the ground.
//Youko's house. I don't think he literally puts his hands on the ground tho. -GHS
So, school.
I look up at the sky.
Another hot day today, then.
Yet the air is inexplicably dry, and there's signs it will be pleasantly nice.
The moisture and the heat that flow in from the sea, as well, should be quite mild today.
//end added portion -GHS
/Looks like it'll be warm today as well.
///Eliminated as redundant. -GHS
As the name implies, Kamisaka (Look at the Top of the Hill) has way many hills.
//http://www.yado.co.jp/kankou/nagasaki/tushima/kamizakak/kamizakak.htm hmmmmmmmmm, I don't see it. The meaning is closer to "look up at the hill" or "seen from above the hill", but given the whole point of this is a pun between "Hill of God" and a hint that the hokora is important - the hill is the mountain, see CCA0002 - might as well make this more explicit. -GHS
It is necessary to cross a great number of slopes before one at long last reaches school.
Up and down and up and down, just to go to school.
They remind of the storminess that is human life, filling with weariness the hearts and feet of those who travel on ahead.
//Because life and going to school and SYMBOLISM!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"So heavy..."

I'm used to this, but still I feel sluggish.
Walking is still fine,
going around these hills with a bike would be much more of a problem.
//This would indicate problems with Nanaka, but look at Sakuraba and, most importantly, Taichi effortlessly chasing Kiri in a bike when she goes for training. See CCZAS: him using a bike even there is symbol for -GHS
Bicycles are conceived for flat ground.
Climbs harder than a walk, descents that are a fleeting instant of bliss.
//The bike or, because there's no point kidding ourselves, SYMBOLISM!!! of how the climbs are still harsh. -GHS
That made me feel as if only the times of our hardships would continue on endlessly.
//Check that always-on streetlight, odd. The map points out that the Elvis store, on the right, is mysterious and no one knows what it sells. I suspect that since there's plenty of theories on whether Elvis died at all and how, and there's plenty of similar theories that can be made on more than one character here, that it sells meta. -GHS
The shopping street that leads from downtown connects into a crossing at the summit of the hill.
//See map. Connect, crossing are returning terms because SYMBOLISM but also troll. 'Shopping street' will be used to indicate the Tasaki store area here, at the edge of downtown, but not actual downtown, so I indicate both anyway. -GHS
Ahead in that direction is the apartment complex where Yamanobe Miki, one half of the Flowers, lives.
//Wow, that's the correct way of writing it! Of course, it's actually a typo, it was fixed to FLOWER'S in the console version. And yes, I am so so so so tempted of doing the same, as I strongly suspect this is more hints of Taichi's ill manners and that readers are supposed to take most of this erudition with a grain or seven of salt. Also keep in mind that he'll later be uncertain as to where Miki lives, whoops. -GHS
Miki is my Kouhai, a first year.
She has a hairstyle similar to that of those three female magicians in that fantasy series that's super famous worldwide.
//Just about every hint point to the TV series Charmed. Of course he can't reference Harry Potter inside his universe, the movie is 2001 and the Japanese translation of the book is 1999. Until he will, of course. Witches return, and most importantly, Cross Channel is closer to fantasy with a sci-fi coat than anything. -GHS
Looks, certainly, but the resemblance is more thorough.
She might not be able to use magic, but one could call her a sorceress of words.
//This won't play *that* much, as with much of Week 1 it's a relatively early treatment and things aren't quite settled yet, but indeed taking Miki underhand is a biiig problem here. -GHS
It's impossible to stop her once she starts talking, and it's difficult to even stop her from wanting to talk.
Her social class is rich in young femaleness, and her vocabulary is similarly rich, so one never grows tired of talking to her.
//Sexual implication that she's fun to talk to because she's hot + contrast with her being poor in money (not yet stated). Also they can fight with words and so she's his waifu forever and also ever. Social standing will sort of return. Love how of all OMFG HARD KANJI's here, "vocabulary" is furry'd. The reason is that 彙 wasn't joyo until 2010, so there's nothing deep about it, but it's funny in retrospect. -GHS
Miki is often found mate-ing with one other first year member of the club, the one with the Japanese word for fog for a name, Sakura Kiri.
//"Mate-ing" will recur, plus vague lesbian subtext. There's several fog puns 'round her route especially, so here's your warning. -GHS
Miki the long haired one, and Kiri the androgynous short-haired one:
the two assembled beautify the place like a flower bed.
Hence, "Flowers".
//You'll notice the Japanese translation in parenthesis, because furrygana does not technically work the way I use it, but you can't expect furries to teach you about Japanese, can you. -GHS
They are mascot-like presences in our club.
Miki, by the by, really loves miniskirts. She's always in one.
//She's never OUT of one outside of sex scenes, though it's not like the dress code of Gunjou is that impressive (forget Touko, are Kiri and Misato going to the same school?) -GHS
And she's so upfront and adorable. We mash together well.
//"We get along well" + "Riding her is fine too." -GHS
Even setting aside how I also really love miniskirts, there's no reason for us not to get along.
//Given his backstory this has multiple meanings, that "even", in particular. -GHS
When she graduates, I had her promise to give me her uniform.
However, the proposal to give her the second button of my uniform in return was courteously and thoroughly declined.
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_school_uniform wow it's on Wikipedia, too. She's just teasing him anyway. -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'mooorn."

I entered the shop at the very edge of the shopping street:
                    『Tasaki Groceries』

[Taichi]
"Anyone heeere?"

I call towards the back of the store.
There's no response.

[Taichi]
"...unmanned?"

Tasaki Groceries had been often left unmanned of late.
//That's sooo convenient, isn't it. -GHS
The shopkeeper here, a Tasaki Goichirou (age 47, single) is an unrivaled railway enthusiast.
//technically it *is* Mr. Tasaki, but that sounds just so damn off with the honorifics. Reality's unrealistic and all that. He's single because he's a Priest of God... no, I seriously suspect he is, just like Taichi will end up eternally single given he's lost in his own world. -GHS
He must've casually opened the store, then trundled off to some faraway place to take pictures of their local train line.
And, all the while, the shop still stays open.
In other words it's a clerk-less store.
This shop had likely been an amusement for him from the beginning.
When he was in his thirties, he had the kind of nastiness in his face that is often used to scare crybabies to sleep ("kids who sleep grow up well, kids who cry die"), but sometime after the death of his parents, his face changed into one of abundance, its harshness lost.
//I worked in the referenced proverb because Bible Game'ses are only about edutainment, sort of how you learned the totally correct furrygana's up there and how your about to learn how to correctly use 'your' in a sentence. There's another 豊, hope that's clear enough that this is a reference to a major subtext in CC. -GHS
Something outside the inheritance has changed someone who's more of a member of a biker gang than a railway fanatic into a nice guy, perhaps.
//See CCX0001. This guy's the Greek chorus: what happened to him is religious conversion. I suspect the hospital, too. -GHS
Anyway, right now the shop owned by this man with a smiling face is one of those very rare, local-contact type stores that allows an unlimited tab for those who live around it.
//It's such a convenient coincidence that if the owner wasn't a man of God, and therefore all of this generated by God himself as Providence, and therefore its convenience being itself a major plot point, it'd be bad writing. -GHS
I run the pen on the notebook I carry around.
//Oddly, it seems the actual memos aren't provided by the shop. -GHS

With the adhesive tape provided, I stick the note to the wall.
//...but the tape is? -GHS
Looking closer, there are several of these memos are up already.

[Taichi]
"Ah, that Miki, did she already go on ahead?"
//These date back to the approximate first day of training camp. If everyone's out of town until evening, no one needs to get anything from Tasaki on credit, however. -GHS

//Hmmm, two oddities besides Miki obviously stealing. First, these have been up for days. No biggie, that's just until they pay. There's also nothing of Taichi's up: still no biggie, he either paid earlier, or simply doesn't read his own. As this goes on, however, whether this is really no big deal is no longer that obvious. See CCZAS: what if all these are written by him? -GHS
Miki, tab's running up.
When it's time for the bill, there'll be hell to pay here.
//Total 440 yen 4+4+0=8. Indeed, once the bill comes that'll be a problem since things simply don't add up to 8. And, of course, this pointing out - like the clock thing in her route - is there to hint that she's lying about something, in this case what she buys. -GHS
Sakuraba, stow your thoughts.
//But who's gonna do furry/furigana jokes then??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

Behind Sakuraba's idiocies, there's one more sheet.
//THE TRUTH WAS BEHIND SAKURABA ALL ALONG, AND TOUKO KNOWS IT. Or something. -GHS
Was it hidden?
My interest piqued, I took it off.
//It's never quite clear how these sheets are arranged. -GHS

Ohhh my.
Young lady covets three of those cylinders!
//This is one of the few so hard to see it missed censoring (though without the next line it's less obvious). -GHS
You're so rich, but this is embaraaassing, and shaaamefuuul!
//Although in retrospect, this is actually a DOUBLE SYMBOLISM!!! as in, her wanting to subsist on water alone is sort of like wanting to subsist on Taichi's dick (certainly not his love) alone. -GHS
I'll put it back in the most prominent spot.
Stick!

[Taichi]
"And with this, we're good."

I went into the back of the store and grabbed one bottle of tea.

[Taichi]
"Well then, let's say that's on credit."
//Subtle hint that there'll be no one to actually call on it? Of course there's technically no problem. Tasaki's technically loaded so he wouldn't care too much, whether one interprets the concepts of forgiveness of debts in this literal sense or not. Or whether the debt these people are in with Tasaki is literal or not. -GHS

I left the store.
Pouring tea down my throat, I headed towards school.
//Wait a second I just realized 110 yen is way less than 200! Miki ripped me off!!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Oh my."

There was a previous visitor in the classroom.
In a seat in the row next to the window,
//Where protagonists usually sit. Not Taichi. This irrelevant detail is, of course, of tremendous significance. -GHS
there sat a girl, with her elbow on the table, sends a single peeking glance my way.
//Some of these older descriptions don't quite match the CGs. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

Without a word, she returns her line of sight to the outside.

[Taichi]
"You're quick on your school commute."
//Her house is technically closer than Taichi's. Joking formality that could easily be read as scornful. The possibility she spends day and night at school is far from remote, given how it's possibly around 1AM. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

[Taichi]
"And yet you came to school in normal clothes again?"
[Taichi]
"You really manage to wear that hot-looking thing often, can't you."
//Since she's always in that dress, and how she has multiple of them at home will become a joke later on, emphasis on 'often'. I actually wonder if that "hot" is meant English style as well. Taichi may not know English, but that doesn't stop him from affecting himself American or at least non-Japanese, especially 'round this first route. -GHS

[Touko]
"..."

Ignored.

[Taichi]
"Hey hey."

Shrugging my shoulder, I sit in the seat next Touko's... mine.
//Possibly actually his, possibly irrelevant because there's no classes/this is Youko's Special Classroom/Class X. -GHS
Just like a hedgehog.
//The only direct reference to the fairly trite Hedgehog Dilemma throughout the story, mercifully. The needles could actually be HIS, however. -GHS
And lately, taken to polishing those needles.
It's the same with everyone, so it's nothing to be worried about.
But the needles set against me... feel like they have a bit of poison in them.
//This could still be him: the fight with himself is spiritual, after all. See CCZAS: delayed poison attack as what uhmmm let's say SYMBOLISM and move on. -GHS
Maybe it's just my imagination, I don't know,
it might just be my excessive self-consciousness, perhaps,
//Body Dismorphic Disorder awareness? -GHS
but,
and also however,
just by thinking that,
I had a seizure.
//See CCA0016/17A. This will not actually return often: Taichi's odd behavior is only really highlighted around this route. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Cut it out now! Cut it out cut it out!"

Fortunately the fit was small, so there was no danger of it scattering my rationality.
In exchange for the chills of swallowing acid reflux, its head is imprisoned back in the hellish abyss.
//Vomit is exactly what Yusa does. Similarly Touko. This is strong evidence that it's Taichi who rejected her, not viceversa. -GHS
The tip of its heteromorphic tongue is scythed down in a flash, and lays calm on the surface of the earth.
//Oddly, that 'scythe down' seems to also mean that, which is the only thing that seems to make sense. Used both as this returns in a highly metaphorical scene in CCD4002. "Chirori" is an illegal and evil SFX as there'll be lots in this accursed moege and they're the #1 reason why Cross Channel is so damn hard to translate. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hey."

[Touko]
"...what."

A tone that sounds just about fed up with fooling around, Touko's.

[Taichi]
"Around your ass there's a tear, and I can see your panties."

[Touko]
"......!!! ......!!!"
//She takes THIS seriously of him? -GHS

Standing up in a panic, she gropes her behind with both hands.

[Taichi]
"Awww what a dumb thing I said."
//Giko neko/2chan meme. Seems to date to 1999, however, and can't date the meme to 2003 or earlier either. The meme seems to have overtaken all other references. No 'official' English translation that I found, but a literal works anyway. -GHS

Ker-smack!!!
//It's not ANIMU without ker-something. -GHS

[Taichi]
"G'fuh!"

Sudden palm strike.
Bail into slipdown.
//Lit. sliding as one bails off a racing motorbike. That one doesn't seem to have a single English term tho. -GHS
A magnificent fall.

[Taichi]
"OwChChCh!"

Touko was already sitting in the exact unchanging posture as moments before.

[Taichi]
"But I was just kidding!"

[Touko]
"..."

It doesn't look like she's looking to play around with someone.
Clannishly demure.
But hearts, surprisingly, have many openings.
I dump my bag on the desk and pass a lost gaze on the classroom, empty with the exception of Touko.
//So he had it in his hands when he was punched down? Hints that he never was, perhaps. The Taichi Bag's never described as a backpack, for that matter. -GHS
There's still time before we begin.
//Ambiguous as to what. -GHS
What to do.
