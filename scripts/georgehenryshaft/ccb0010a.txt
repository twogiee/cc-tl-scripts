Touko, ever unchanging, was sitting vacantly in the classroom.
She has no one to talk to,
no club activities to join,
//These are true for her regardless of whether there's anyone else. -GHS
no objective either, she just stays there.

[Taichi]
"..."

It's correct.
For a person this is proper.
All had vanished, suddenly.
There's no point denying that the only motive power left inside is inertia.
Thinking about it, that was ironic.
All normal people have perished, all hands lost, and only we have survived.

[Taichi]
"Kirihara."

[Touko]
"..."

Huu-hum.

[Taichi]
"Dialogue."

[Touko]
"?"

Her face stood puzzled but an instant, then immediately secluded itself in the gaol of speculation (i.e. she's pretending).
//That means she's pret--- oh. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dialogue!"

So I say as if a zombie.
//Because automatism, dead still alive, dragging instead of shouting, and also Christianity is life therefore engaging (remember Sakuraba is a zombie). -GHS

[Taichi]
"Dialogue, dialogue."
[Taichi]
"Dialogue!"

[Touko]
"What's it even now!"

A monster of dialogue.
//As in the Monster of Rationality. -GHS
No, a monstrous dialogue.
...whyat?
Ah, who cares.
//Could be the intended reaction to the reaction the crap above, could be about the Beast that he's taken to "ignoring". -GHS

[Taichi]
"Conversation Conversation. Dialogue Dialogue. Needed Needed!"

With major gesticulation mixed in for emphasis.

[Taichi]
"...unneeded."
[Taichi]
"Without dialogue you don't even come to exist!"

[Touko]
"...I don't really get it."
[Touko]
"Stay back and do not talk to me!"
[Touko]
"Besides, you just treat me like I don't matter!"

[Taichi]
"That's not true!"
[Taichi]
"I like clean purty Kirhara."

[Touko]
"There we go! You just want to be around someone you like, now?!"

[Taichi]
"Yep."

[Touko]
"Lies!"

[Taichi]
"Truth."

[Touko]
"But, but but..."

At a loss for words.

[Touko]
"Stay back and do not talk to me."

Seems the volcano of words has fizzled.
//A "stream" of words would be more English, maybe, but Touko is about fire so a river would be mixing metaphors. -GHS
Combustion incomplete.
When I'm told in harsh tones not to approach or talk, I end up wanting to get close and talk.
I get close and talk to her, but once more she harshly tells me to stay away and not to talk to her.

[Taichi]
"Hmmm-mh."

CSQ 0 1 1
- Get close and talk to her
- Go to club activities
