Tomoki was mending the camouflage posted towards the corridor.
//See CCC0011A.ã€€Very interesting HE'S mending it now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Heeey."

[Tomoki]
"Oh, Taichi..."

Seeming ashamed, he distances himself from the window.
Our club room has windows inlaid in the wall towards the corridor,
so that surveillance is possible from the outside if required.
The reason is easy to guess.
//Actually, given how regulations are next to ignorable in Gunjou, no, it's not easy to guess at all. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...but fixing this's meaningless, innit?"

[Tomoki]
"It just bothered me. Doesn't have to have meaning."
//See CCA0029. Interesting progress. The problem with this is another: this is Monday. That thing's been draping off for how long now? And it didn't matter before. The reason would be simple: the Club Room isn't being used that much anymore, and it's been a while since it has been in use serious enough to need the camouflage. And the same is simply true now. -GHS

Meaningless indeed, then.
Certainly that is true... in the practical sense.
But what about in the heart?

[Tomoki]
"But really, there's seriously nobody."

[Taichi]
"Yep, it really looks like it's just us eight."

[Tomoki]
"Something happened who knows what..."
//Careful on the progress: "there's no one" could be in the club room. This one could be "yeah, there's nobody here". -GHS

Tomoki was bearing a grudge on Mimi-senpai,
despite how they're blood-related siblings.
//Like this. Why would he talk about Misato? Because that's who isn't in the room. -GHS
As to why their last name is different, there seem to circumstances of all sorts.
Family circumstances.

[Taichi]
"That thing last evening, you serious?"

[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"When you said that you'll take care of the food problem."

[Tomoki]
"Yeah, I'll be getting to work after noon. I just came to school to see how's things a bit."

[Taichi]
"Food, right."

It's something unnecessary,
for the world will be revolving in one week regardless.
//Well, that takes 365 days and change, but... -GHS
Even supposing there's death, there will be recovery.

[Taichi]
"..."

Discomfort. In the heart.
Cut it out...
For if I can't calm myself...

[Taichi]
"Friendship demands..."
//HACK smirky Tomoki. This is not associated with a happy Tomoki, however. -GHS

[Tomoki]
"Nothing in return."

Tahm!
We stuck our thumbs up.
//No laughing... -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...what's that all of a sudden."
[Tomoki]
"Say, Tomoki."
[Tomoki]
"Hm?"

[Taichi]
"You're... fighting with Mimi-senpai, right?"

[Tomoki]
"Yeah..."

[Taichi]
"And is that going to go on even when the times are like this?"
//NOBODY changes in this! -GHS

[Tomoki]
"...not really."

Darkening.

[Tomoki]
"I don't give a damn about that person there."

Stubborn words.
//See CCC4025. Then again his insistent behavior (unless 'fixed' by Taichi) should make this obvious enough. -GHS

[Taichi]
"With manga and the like we've had quarrels that have led to all sorts of downfalls, though."
//HACK actually do it -GHS

Tomoki made a grim, sullen face.
