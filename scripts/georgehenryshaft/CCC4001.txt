[Miki]
"Heeellooo!"
//HACK out from the sky, Miki alone -GHS
PCP CCA0006. We're deep into it now. -GHS

Miki came shortly thereafter,
dragging Kiri with her.
//HACK surprised Misato, both her and Kiri -GHS

[Misato]
"...Yamanobe-san?"

[Miki]
"Yamanobe Miki here. We have come!"
//RAISU KAWAII DESU-NYA -GHS
[Miki]
"Come on, Kiri-chin, greeting!"

[Kiri]
"...hi."
//That's basically her catchphrase by now. -GHS

[Miki]
"Voice too low. Can't hear!"
//See CCA0027 -GHS

[Kiri]
"...he-, hellooo!"

[Miki]
"'Hello' my behind. Give a proper good morning now!"

[Kiri]
"g-, gOOdmORnInG."

[Miki]
"The 'g', the 'd', the 'm' and the 'n' where too small. One more time!"
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

Paffity, she slaps Kiri's ass.
Nitpickeeer!
//http://www.paradisearmy.com/doujin/pasok_komakei.htm oddly, this would mean that Miki's strict on the details, not how awesome it was that she slapped Kiri's butt. This threw me off for a while. -GHS

[Kiri]
"Kyah! ...don't slap me, really..."

Kiri was being assiduously imposed on by Miki.
//Literally means "dominate" (generally a wife to a husband), though it reads like "she's establishing herself on her ass", ergo ass pun. -GHS
I wanna be imposed on too.

[Kiri]
"G-, good morning."

She bows her head with a sharp bob.
//Hi Yusa -GHS

[Miki]
"Goody, goody!"

When it was time to get things done, Miki-chin was sadistic.
//Like Yutaka... -GHS

[Taichi]
"What kind of bow was even thaaat! Isn't the angle 4 degrees insuffiiiiicieeeeent!"
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

[Miki]
"...because delicate little Kiri-chin is under plenty of stress, it is best to avoid picking on her."

[Taichi]
"Tell me beforehand..."

Miki had told me after I had been downed.
//HACK doubty Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Uhmmm, what might you two be doing here?"

[Miki]
"We have come to participate in club activities."

[Misato]
"Ah, but... letting you do this, that would be..."

[Miki]
"We have come to participate."
//Mi. -GHS
[Miki]
"Uhm, well, but you have been cutting up until now..."
[Miki]
"We have come to participate."
//Mimi. -GHS

[Misato]
"I was thinking I would be doing this alone, without having everyone come in..."

[Miki]
"We have come to participate."
//Mimimi. -GHS

Senpai has a desperate desire to decline.
//Sometimes it's just better in English, period. -GHS
Was I right then, and the only goal she had for club was flight?

[Taichi]
"It is just as I expected."
//See the potatoes. -GHS

My powers of human observation were, now, infinitely close to God.
//See CCC0003B. ~troll~troll~troll~ -GHS

[Miki]
"We have come to participate in club activitieees!"
//Around 3 objections and she gives in. Ironically, that makes her pretty much human. -GHS

And then Miki puts on more and more pressure.
//This is all but how CCA0025B ends. -GHS

[Miki]
"Well... ngggh..."

[Taichi]
"There are no ways to avoid this, not even averting one's eyes away from reality. All of us will rot away from here, this harmless young boy included, ergo please surrender and enjoy the present!"
//HACK more pissy Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"Ohhh, seriously, Peke-kun, you..."
//HACK independent CG shake -GHS

With a smile,
but forcefully.
//Notice the total lack of reaction... then again, Zubaaan is not supposed to happen at all, as it. -GHS

[Miki]
"Well then, please order us."

[Misato]
"Uhmmmm, I am stumped..."

[Miki]
"Eheheh."

[Misato]
"...Sakura-san, you shall also help then?"
//HACK invert Miki and Misato, fix positions -GHS

[Kiri]
"I-, I have been... forced by Miki..."

[Miki]
"Incontrollable sexual desire."
//See CCD0008B -GHS

In a whisper.

[Kiri]
"Please allow me to participate."

So said Kiri, straightening up her back.
//HACK more annoyed Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"...sigh, there are no ways."
//HACK happy Misato -GHS
[Misato]
"Then... I shall accept your help..."

[Miki]
"Weeee, an Adolescent School Dramaaa! ...Kiri-chin?"
//"It's a ****ing VN set at school where the protagonist is a second year and he gets girls older and younger!" -GHS

[Kiri]
"...w-, weeee... adolescent school dramaaa... sigh."
//Try as hard as you want, but you have (shudder) ve-ve-vertical shimapants (squiiick!), therefore I will hate you forever and ever, Kiri. -GHS

[Misato]
"But once again, why so suddenly..."

[Miki]
"It is the result of Miki's trial and error. Well, do not be worried."

[Taichi]
"...determined innshe."

[Misato]
"So even you will participate, then."

[Taichi]
"Sorry... but Miki, she..."

[Miki]
"...adorable elephant."

In a whisper.

[Taichi]
"It is due to my personal volition, Your Excellency!"

So I proclaimed with a bow.

[Misato]
"Was Peke-kun made into a soldier?!"
//See CCA0002 -GHS

[Taichi]
"What do you say, madam!"
//Hum, appears to be found in a Japanese translation of The Tortoise and the Hare that I can't source, or a song based on it (ibid). -GHS
[Taichi]
"Kurosu Taichi has never and not for one instant forgot his Prussian soul!"
//Prussia, from Axis Powers Hetalia, has white hair and red eyes. He's a sadist, obnoxious, and keeps a diary. Not saying they're reciprocally influenced, just wondering if they were working off the same source. Sounds like a pun (professional parallel? gastric gland???), uncertain of what if so. May just be more Nations of the World allegory, considering soul has the God kanji (and that omfg omfg omfg is 100% pr00f) (alcohol). -GHS

[Misato]
"Are you not a prototypical mongoloid?"
//Doesn't seem to have that other meaning in Japanese; however, it being Tanaka, I can't exclude that he knows regardless. Especially since "mongoloid", as an insult, surprisingly doesn't refer to people who tried to become Japanese and instead became just obnoxious weeaboos, but to those with Down's syndrome (I know, not much difference). Even if it's not Taichi's possibly self-imposed autism, it'd fit the Scientific Troll aspect of it all. Leaving it uncapitalized, either it's obvious or it is not. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is the Nihonprussia anyway."

[Miki]
"It's just like the Japanese Alps isn't it."
//http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps vs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Alps which I suppose plays further into the allegory. -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is as your statement says."
//HACK cliff-puff Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Senpai and Kiri-chin both are very nice kids so, please make use of them like you would bullets in a machine gun."
//Oh, another thing that's back. -GHS

[Misato]
"...so it is... if it has to be like this, then, do this with all your might if you please."

[Miki]
"First of all, we should bring up the heaviest of the necessary things that haven't been brought over yet."
//...that's an odd way to put it, but, K. -GHS

Litil divil...
//ohhh, another odd reference I added. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...but I can't lift weights..."

Kiri was also tearful.
For the moment,
going to the hokora is suspended...
//HACK fade music, in "Way to Home" -GHS
A number of hours later,
club activities had ended.
On the way out of the school building, I look up at the rooftop.
I could see the tip of the antenna.
And next to it,
Senpai was, once more, still there.

[Taichi]
"..."

Zealous in her club activities.
It's so incredibly student-like.
//See CCA0030 -GHS
But, certainly, that wholesome behavior is also being used for flight.
In any case.

[Taichi]
"...hoh."

Tired.

[Kiri]
"...hoh."

The very same, then.

[Miki]
"That was one productive daaay!"

Well it was, wasn't it.
But you've only exploited others,
//See, of course, Kiri route -GHS
yourself you've swung your baton around just like a conductor.
//See CCA0027 among others -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well, I'm off this way, so,"

I walk off.

[Kiri]
"...bye then, Miki."

[Miki]
"Yes, bai bai!"

The sound of footsteps from behind.

[Miki]
"Let's go home together up to the shopping street!"

Miki lines up.

[Taichi]
"Shoo we are, feel free twhoo."
//Cutesy -GHS

I was tired.

[Miki]
"Oh yeeeah, I developed 'those'."

Partway through club activities, Miki went to the Photography Club room to do just that.

[Taichi]
"...but if I think about it, there's only eight people you can show them to, aren't there. Minus you and me, that's just six."
//Unless there's also everyone else. And they know. And why include Youko...? -GHS

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin said the same thing, she did. Well, will you quit club?"

[Taichi]
"...bah, I went together with this so far. I'll do as you like."

[Miki]
"Ehahah..."
[Miki]
"You're a strong one, Senpai!"
//See CCA0006. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I am?'

[Miki]
"It's so fun to watch a man briskly move things around. It was quite worth it to recruit into the club!"
//lawl gurlz liek strong men's -GHS

She did it just for that purpose...

[Miki]
"Your labor performance has been splendid. I shall treat you to juice at the Tasaki Store."

[Taichi]
"HA. HA. HA. Thank you very much."

My face stiffens thoroughly.
Why this girl...!

[Taichi]
"Well, isn't it good to be busy doing something."

[Miki]
"It is, it is!"

[Taichi]
"It's great that we can think calmly about all the little details, yes."

[Miki]
"...this week, let us make it a School Adolescent Drama."
//See above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And next week?"

[Miki]
"Hmmm. The Voyage of the Eight Men and Women in Search of the Survivors of Mankind... something like that."

[Taichi]
"That sounds interesting."

These are the times we will live in,
until the eight people become 0.
//~loop~ -GHS

[Taichi]
"But me, I'd rather do normal things here."

It's probably in the disposition of mankind this preference to do what is usual.

[Miki]
"...I see."

We arrived.
Miki indeed treated me.

[Taichi]
"This really feels like a normal day don't it."

[Miki]
"Yes!â™ª"

The sky is aglow in the sunset.
Right now, it made my thoughts return to the sun setting over mankind.
//HACK music ends after the script instead of that odd point. -GHS
