     It was the Broadcast Club Training Camp.
    Among us the freshmen are being promoted,
    while the happy third years are retiring.
           New freshmen have joined.
        A fresh line-up of seven faces.
         But actually there were eight.
     7/8, well, we should be OK, I thought.
Her... after all, she'll turn up quick if called.
          For this gathering of seven,
        there was no cheap price to pay.
          But on the other hand, what
       was gained was by no means plenty.
           Rather, the result could
            be called a net minus.
                     Anger,
                    jealousy,
                   resentment.
               Reciprocal hurting,
                  then parting.
           That was our training camp.
      One of the causes was how there was
        no teaching staff participating.
          Because these club activities
           are intended to be private,
     a mischief kept away from the Institute.
          If this was turned public, it
          would become quite the uproar.
        But I thought we'd be alright.
           If there's self control,
          and if she stands at guard,
          then, I thought, the worst
       case scenario would be avoidable.
         I went all that far... what
           did I even want to do?
      I went as far as roping in Senpai.
        Finally, this Training Camp home
         of sorrow and agony is ending.
    Seven people reached the way of return.
        I did not not want to see them.
        This exhaustion, this weariness,
       this averting of gazes that are
               never let cross.
             Those faces of people
            strangers to each other.
              So I moved on ahead.
En route, the day grew darker.
There was this feeling of having walked for horribly long hours.
A countless number of hours.
On a path that ordinarily never takes more than an hour.
Was it fatigue?
No one said even one word.
The sound of seven pairs of footsteps was the entire world.
An unnaturally quiet mountain trail.
Not even the sound of insects reaches the ears.
A chilling sensation made by the mood alone,
when however it is Summer.
Because I could see, even if it was dark.
Because I could see the way.
For a long time now I have been capable of seeing through the dark.
At the time when thoughts turned to wondering if we had gone the wrong way, we turned up in town.
               Mankind had fallen.
