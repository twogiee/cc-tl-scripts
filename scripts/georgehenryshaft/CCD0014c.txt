Kiri was in the corridor.
//HACK no Kiri doll yet -GHS
This, too, was just as always.
It's just that things often don't go efficiently.

[Taichi]
"Kiriii!"
//HACK fade doll now -GHS

[Kiri]
"Mngh!"

I'm glared at.

[Taichi]
"Mngh!"
//HACK Awesome! -GHS

I glare
//HACK flash screen -GHS
DrRrRrRrRrRrRrRrRill!!! (psychological effect)
I just endured the itch that came in the nipple.
//HACK no need -GHS

[Miki]
"Wheeew, so refreeeshed!"

Before long Miki comes out the toilet,
//HACK and awesome 2 -GHS

[Miki]
"Pyyyyy?!"
//å°¿ (nyou - urine). Guessing it goes with CCB2011. -GHS

and a scream suitable to actions taken up until just then struck the earlobes.
//And that's why. This can refer to Taichi and Kiri and be just a "nooo", of course, but on the other hand: !!PISS PUNS!! -GHS
I inch one step ahead,

[Taichi]
"Did you really think that I would've come here without any sort of preparation?"

and bring my hand to the chest.
And there, my Certain Kill Weapon... isn't because it's all a bluff.
Instead, I scratched my nipple.
//Seems to do so OVER the shirt, not the breast pocket. And still, he scratches the nipple. He can't resist himself, can he. But was it itchy because of predetermination or because of self-fulfilling prophecy? -GHS
It is a technique capable of killing two birds with one stone, simultaneously liquidating the anguish of both threat and nipple.
Kiri also puts her hands behind her back,
and she takes her crossbow out front.
//HACK with the CG too -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whooooa."

Adequate surprise,
however, don't you go getting mentally strained...
It could be said that there's no problem even if I get struck dead.
//IOW, he is CERTAIN that he will be back at the hokora and do the same stuff as of now. Very interesting change in behavior. -GHS
Hmm-hm.
I wonder if that's going to be one of the choices?
//Fourth wall/ fourth wall/ this VN/ has no fourth wall (on the Spider-Man cartoon theme because uhmmm science). -GHS
