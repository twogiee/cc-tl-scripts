Mimi-senpai was yet still sleeping.
//HACK zoom -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hello, hellooo."

[Misato]
"...mmmh?"

[Taichi]
"Good day to you. It is morning. I am Taichi."
//To avoid repeating 'morning'. -GHS

[Misato]
"Eh... ah, it's true..."
//Well, that he is Taichi at least. -GHS

Slowly and sluggishly she gets up.
Uhmmm, I will be seeing her panties, right.
I went to one knee,
the same as a knight who wishes to be of use to his Queen (except for the motivation).

[Misato]
"First thing, good morning!

[Taichi]
"Good morning, Senpai."
[Taichi]
"If you sleep here in the middle of the day you will die of sunlight exposure, you know?"

[Misato]
"Ah, yes, that is right, I was careful."

Senpai lifts the hem of her skirt and wipes her glasses.
Ohhh,
plump and voluptuous.
//See CCA0016. -GHS
So moderately plump and voluptuous.
Senpai's so pretty ain't she.
//HACK later doll change -GHS

[Misato]
"Fwhaaah."

The skirt returned to its original position with a paf,
and Senpai wears back her glasses.
//HACK less sleepy Misato -GHS

[Misato]
"I am so sleepy."

[Taichi]
"It is just the Indian Spring."
//HACK doubty Misato instead -GHS

[Misato]
"I have not heard the words exactly like that..."
//Adapted to above. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because I invented them."
//HACK normal instead -GHS

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, you seem to have a talent for inventing things."
//She finally came out and said it. "Invention" should be read in the meaning of "fabrication", of course. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."

[Misato]
"Why are you staying squatted like that?"

[Taichi]
"My Anti-Aircraft Gun of Love has fallen madly in lust for this sky. It has recurved 'till nearly it reaches the belly button."
//As far as I can tell, "へそまで反り返る" just means "I have a big dick and a big hardon". -GHS

[Misato]
"That is something so uncouth, and yet you speak of it in ways so poetic..."
//She's not even hiding that she gets it, tho. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I am sorry for the trouble I am causing."

[Misato]
"Say, I am a bit parched."

Senpai rustled into her own bags.
//Fnarr, fnarr. -GHS
Tumble!

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

A single serving of cup sake.

[Misato]
"Gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp!"
//BTW: console version is "non-alcoholic beverages. For some reason, she can manage to get drunk on these. Must be the Placebo Effect." -GHS

[Taichi]
"Bwah, I nearly forgot!"

I forcibly take it away.

[Misato]
"Ah...! What are doing?"

[Taichi]
"Alcoholics are not allowed at school!"

[Misato]
"My grandma's house is also a liquor store, so it is fine."
//Misato has upgraded from 'salaryman-level habitual drunk' to 'alcoholics anonymous escapee'. This isn't her house, as she lives with her father (and now alone as he's in jail). It's never referenced again. Unknown who she's talking about. May be irrelevant, but this being Cross Channel, it's always worth looking over things -GHS

[Taichi]
"It is not allowed!"

[Misato]
"...I do know."
//HACK no change, it's really not that heavy a scene. -GHS

She pouted.

[Misato]
"But by now there are no more rules we must follow, are there?"
//Compare Youko and Taichi with regards to Mutsumi, see CCC3012b -GHS

[Taichi]
"Well."

[Misato]
"It is just like that, yes, when people are not there anymore, then rules have no meaning."
//HACK no change, either. -GHS
[Misato]
"Then, for what purpose should I..."
//See CCD1001. She's also sort-of understanding this... -GHS

She nearly tears the hair off her head.

[Taichi]
"...Senpai."

[Misato]
"Peke-kun, why are you here?"

[Taichi]
"I came to see how things are."

[Misato]
"...why... after all this time."
//Tuesday morning? Well, he hasn't shown up to club in a long while. But how long has this particular club gone on now? How many years? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because I love you, Mimi-senpai."

[Misato]
"......that... is just..."

The tip of her nose reddening should be alcohol's fault, right?
//He wishes. -GHS

[Misato]
"Speaking this frivolously is unacceptable! Words of love are what creates a precious crossroad between men and women both!"
//I totally wrote "between me and women" !!!Bisex Misato!!! 分岐点 is also parting of ways, so leaving it a somewhat generic crossroad makes it more visible that it plays in the Cross But Not Meet subtext. -GHS

I was scolded.

[Taichi]
"Well... but the one who led me out of the darkness and into a place of light was you, Senpai!"
//See CCA0025C. -GHS

Unlike a certain she who merely lived next to me and nothing more.

[Misato]
"That would be... I just called out to you, that is all."

[Taichi]
"And what was the cue but that?"

[Misato]
"Enough! Enough! We move on from this topic nooow!"

Flapping wave of the hand.
...is this not going to work?

[Taichi]
"Association, such as dating, as a prerequisite for marriage is---"

[Misato]
"Right, a script if-you-please!"

She ran away.

[Taichi]
"A script, you say?"

[Misato]
"Yes, this is a request for the production of a pure, honest, cheerful and spirited script for use in our maiden broadcast."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm."

Well, that was the objective from the beginning, after all.

[Taichi]
"It will be done."
//HACK to dark -GHS

However it goes, all patterns up to now have been encompassed in the notebook.
There's no necessity to purposefully create a new one.
//HACK no need (and it looks really f'ing ugly too) -GHS
