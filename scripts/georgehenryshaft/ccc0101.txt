Accept it?
//HACK dim screen -GHS
Me? Death?
Absurd, I think.
I don't think I would be able to consent to my own death.
The instinct to exist is very strong.
As tenacious, likely, as an insect in the desert.
Besides, the hatred that came from Kiri was something I didn't really know what to do with.
Unexpectedly, I grew annoyed.
//See CCA0011C. -GHS
I should be living, but,
there's nothing but despair, so,
I should just laugh, yet...
//HACK groan... these are always a pain to make. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri... let's stop."
//Likely exactly what happened at the end of the Misato route of Downfall -GHS

I take one step... forwards.
//HACK moar zoom -GHS

[Taichi]
"This here, isn't it just a case of mutual murder?"
//It was all settled above. This is just perfunctory. -GHS

I take one step... forwards.
//HACK moar zoom -GHS

[Taichi]
"You hate me, I get it, but still, now, killing each other,"

I take one step... forwards.
//HACK moar zoom??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"it's nonsense innit."

I take one step... forwards.

[Taichi]
"Besides, this won't be good for each other. Even you're in danger."

Supposing Youko-chan was looking,
//Nope. Sent her packing, remember? So when she shows up... -GHS
Kiri could even die the very next second, perhaps.
But... how could I even explain this to her?
How terrifying she is...
//With ever more implications that she's the part of him that Kiri should be afraid of, not his fooling around. -GHS
I grow impatient.
Accidentally, I treaded too far into her territory.

[Taichi]
"Yutaka was---"

[Kiri]
"---!!!"

//HACK in the bolt. -GHS
A light ringing. Of the air.
//HACK flash white and remove bolt. There's no SFX in any version, for some reason, but it sounds odd without it. -GHS
As if a joke, a dark black bolt was stuck precisely in the middle of my chest.

[Taichi]
"Gwoh..."

Fail.
//LOLFail. -GHS
I fell down sitting on the spot from the shock that was being struck.
Agony there isn't.
//However... see CCC3022. -GHS
None at all, unnaturally so.
I cannot even feel if death is coming closer.
Oh, I give up, is this... suffering?
//HACK to black -GHS
Slowly I begin to topple sideways.
//It's the exact same identical reaction he had when Kiri called him really mean words. Could be a parallel, of course... could be that what's happening now is the exact same thing. If a few words can slay Youko, so Taichi can be done the same. Calling him on his hair or eyes, maybe. Calling him on his fake parallel world or transvestitism, maybe. -GHS
I collapsed in the midst of a forest of desks.
I cannot see Kiri anymore.

[Taichi]
"...hah... ...hah... ...hah..."

Shallow breathing.
Am I still not dead yet?
I know that great suffering is approaching me.
...ahhh, that's bad.
I recognize now that instant death is happiness.

[Taichi]
"HahHahHahHahHahHah---"
//Maybe he's just laughing... -GHS

When I come to notice, my breath is becoming frightfully shallow.
My awareness became a dim haze.
//日付さえおぼろげな、遠い霞のなか。 -GHS
I could hear Kiri shrieking.
The sound of glass being cracked.
//Possibly something was flung at the window, which caused the guards to intervene. See CCD1001: Youko, on being revealed, shatters like glass. -GHS
Out of sight... something had... eaten down... into flesh.
//Catfight? See CCA0017A, someone likes to bite indeed. See CCA0003 as well -GHS

[Taichi]
"HahHahHahHahHahHah---hah---"

Suddenly the breathing came to a halt.
Eyeballs went dark, as if covered with mud.
That final instant,
//HACK OK this is creepy. Curiously, it's only in the PS2 version and it's not centered. Works better this way, however, because the reader's sight is on the left side of the screen at this point. -GHS

[Youko]
"...!"

I saw her.
//Notice the lack of loop video. -GHS
