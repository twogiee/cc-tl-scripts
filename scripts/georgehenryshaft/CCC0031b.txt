Miki and Kiri were there.
//HACK to black before, so it looks less crap if the choice to go to the second years' classroom is picked before this. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...without any food, are you?"
//HACK sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Unfortunately..."
//Let's go with non-committal, since she does, but doesn't want to share (perhaps due Kiri, perhaps due to wanting candy, perhaps due to [erroneous use of word 'Japan' here]). -GHS

[Taichi]
"And that bento...?"

Rice.
Meatballs.

[Taichi]
"H-, hey, why do you have that...?"

[Miki]
"Kiri-chin made it! With camping utensils."
//Hey, just like the ones she's borrowing for her camp near the hokora. Surely she can't be lying... -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whoa, nice innit."

[Kiri]
"...there is no part of it for Senpai."
//Specific, see CCC3009 for subtext -GHS

Plainly.

[Taichi]
"Isn't there a fair amount?"
//HACK doubty Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"There's a lot indeed."

It's obvious this could be enough for three people.

[Kiri]
"However for some reason there is none for Senpai."

[Taichi]
"...mngh."

So growls Innocence.

[Taichi]
"Theeen let's transact bit of a barter."

[Miki]
"A trade you mean."
//See CCC3007. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hard candy and gummy candy. Handmade."
//...or because she knows that'll cause this, so she can have candy without arousing Kiri's suspicion too much. Interesting he has candy even with Youko dead. -GHS

The eyes of the two opened very wide.
//HACK no need now -GHS

[Miki]
"Made by hand?"

[Taichi]
"Mh-hm. By Youko-chan though."
[Taichi]
"Sugar in moderation may be good for maintaining an attractive body shape. Gummies are Konjac, 'course. 0 calories."
//HACK surprised Kiri -GHS

[Both]
"0 CALORIES?!"
//Women. -GHS

............

[Taichi]
"Weeee."

Barter concluded.
//This is the second time the "Kiri happy" doll is seen, the first was in the Kiri failed route. It'll appear again below (added from the console version), then never appear again until her Sendback, and CCX0001. -GHS
HACK both dolls at the same time -GHS

[Miki]
"It's like your mommy used to make..."
//HACK unneeded -GHS

[Kiri]
"Just like."

[Miki]
"Milky isn't it."

[Kiri]
"Isn't it."

[Taichi]
"Tastes like stalker though."
//That line is "tastes like your mother", which of course is silly. This is the same format, IOW stalker = mother = Youko. And now, I don't wanna know what's in those things anymore. Especially since Youko may well have, or rather be, a penis. -GHS

[Miki]
"My cheeks... my schmiling cheeks..."

[Kiri]
"Mhhh〜〜〜!"

Girls.
//Heh, see CCC3029 -GHS
And thanks to that, I have come into rice.
Because I'm Japanese, after all.
//See CCA0011C. Guess who also was right about him? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Delicious... you got talent for cooking, Kiri-chin."

[Kiri]
"...side dishes are retort pouch however."
//No specifics. It's possibly she just brought the side dishes, which is why she comments on them. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Still delicious."

[Kiri]
"If I didn't make anything, Miki would only ever eat junk food."
//See CCC3019A -GHS

[Miki]
"But I love junk food."

[Taichi]
"Seems we are all having our problems with our diets."
//HACK Sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Yes..."

[Taichi]
"Kiri-chin, let's get married!"
//HACK slightly angrier Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"That is not possible."

[Miki]
"Not a 'I do not want to', Senpai, it seems it's all the way to impossibility!"

[Taichi]
"...I was burnt."
//HACK unneded -GHS

[Kiri]
"A cold water shower, then?"

[Taichi]
"Not another one, no."
//HACK smiley Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Are there any more sweets?"

[Taichi]
"There are. Got biscuit, got sable'... all thanks to how skilled Youko-sensei is at making sweets."
//Not to be confused with the common Sable http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sable assuredly pain mass-cles of a terrifying craftiness they have! (Or maybe it's a Sabre to make company to that Rance guy?) -GHS

[Miki]
"Ehhh, so unexpected."
//Sooo, why does Youko make candy for him? Assuming she does, actually. And when, since we see her drop off lunch repeatedly and she never gives him anything but sandwiches? And when he's hungry in the Belly Bug scene...? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Seems she got good at making preserved food."
//See CCC0003A. Well, she probably needs lots of preservatives (hee hee) -GHS

[Kiri]
"...are you two lovers?"
//Didn't they ask the same thing in CCA0027... but it seems interesting that even these two don't quite know what Youko and Taichi are to each other. Well, Kiri at least. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh, me and Youko-chan?"

[Miki]
"Miki was very interested about that too!"
//HACK puffy Miki -GHS
[Miki]
"I cHan't even concHentrate on tShe eating!"
//Stuffed. Switching back from third person because using 'she' here just sounds like she's talking about Youko. Miki's not much of a third person person anyway. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...ain't your cheeks all stuffed to the brim."
//HACK caught! Now this part of the scene makes sense. -GHS

[Miki]
"Mugu!"
//when all else fails use engrish -GHS

This girl's doing some Midsummer's Food Storing.

[Taichi]
"Nah, we've just lived together, nothing more."

[Miki]
"Sharing the house."

[Kiri]
"Sharing the house."

The two harmonized.

[Taichi]
"Wrong. Sharing the house is wrong."
//Just that bit suspiciously overstrong. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Uhm, in short, because we don't have parents, the two of us were being supported by Mutsumi-san. Ah, that's my guardian."
//Suspicious singular at the end. -GHS
[Taichi]
"I could sort of say if I could that we're sort of like siblings, but... I don't really think that."

My counterpart also doesn't think so.
And that is why she was kicked out, that Youko-chan.

[Miki]
"Ehhh, news to me!"

[Kiri]
"...and I was thinking it was a really suspicious relationship..."

Nah, it really is suspicious.

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, 'that' you mean. We're not blood related."
//She was totally hoping it'd be real incest, the damn fujoshi. Well, that, or she sorts of suspects Youko is Taichi in a skirt and wig. -GHS

[Miki]
"Hasekura-senpai is a woman of many mysteries, she is."

[Taichi]
"Damn if she ain't."
[Taichi]
"Well then, here's some special Thousand-Year Candy, so we can sink into that Shichi-Go-San ambiance!"
//7-5-3. It googles! And it boils down to 7 and 8! Amazing. -GHS

[Miki]
"Weeee, Thousand-Year Candy!"
//HACK Kiri at least reacts... -GHS

Kiri confiscates it.
//HACK more disappointed Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Bwah, what are you doing!"
//HACK unneded -GHS

[Kiri]
"Sweets only is no good."
//HACK disappointed Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"But you ate them too dammiiit!"

[Kiri]
"Eat your meals properly. Health management is something we absolutely must do on our own from here on out, remember?"

[Miki]
"...yeees."

Indeed.

[Kiri]
"What is it? You are staring at me with indecent eyes..."

[Taichi]
"Don't call 'em indecent."
//He thinks she insulted his eyes, not the way he looks at her. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Well, I was just thinking what a nice duo you make.
//Almost like Taichi and Sakuraba, see CCA0002. Nope, not kidding. -GHS

[Miki]
"We are the Flowers after all."

[Taichi]
"I wanna make you have your debut!"
//HACK sadder Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"But having our debut now, well..."

[Kiri]
"We could sell no more than eight of those CDs."

[Miki]
"The million would be a dream within a dream."

[Kiri]
"Well then, I'll be buying two copies."
//HACK smiley Miki -GHS

[Miki]
"Then I'll buy two too!"

[Kiri]
"Ten copies then."
//HACK unneeded -GHS

[Miki]
"Yep, ten. Double digits."
//All numbers written in Kanji here: 8+2+2+10+10+2=34 3+4=7. The 'million' is written in English via katakana so it doesn't matter. -GHS

Giggling laughter.
Intimate harmony, truly.
And that was something that enriched me just a tiny little bit.
