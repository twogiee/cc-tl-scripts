And then we went to the Kirihara Mansion.

[Touko]
"For now, it's just these!"

Just these,
the gal went and said.
There were about three bike trailer loads,
//They load the stuff on the RV, so he's guesstimating I think. The question is why: the answer, they never take the RV. -GHS
so we went and used the Kiriharas' huge RV.
//Why do the Kiriharas have a huge RV when the only way they'd use it is to get it on a train, as there's no way they can fit that thing on the only path out of town? -GHS
But I can drive even this,
because I've studied racing mangas.
//Well, see CCB2002. -GHS
...between the saying and the doing there is a vast difference in difficulty.
//"Easier said than done" + "Needlessly pretentious overliteralization for reasons of me being too awesome for words." -GHS
Several things have happened, the main of which is that Touko has become traumatized.
To the point where she said she would never ride a vehicle with me driving again.
I am of the same opinion.
//See CCD2002 for actual lines. -GHS
Welll, it was a good thing we had seatbelts.
Anyway, we managed to walk away from the "Let's Use a Vehicle Up to the Neighborhood of the Kurosu Residence" plan, which was good.
Nonetheless, there were still several hundred meters of distance.
//...700? That's gonna be tough, since that's about the entirety of Kamisaka. -GHS
Me and Touko searched for a bike trailer.
//I.e. they don't have them now. -GHS
Perhaps because Touko is so much of an young milady from a rich family, when she mistakenly claimed that a granny bike was a 'trailer' because it had a basket on the front, as a representative of the poor people I massaged her breasts in anger.
//I think I read somewhere that even ojisans like granny bikes. That's very important information! -GHS
I was punched. That is good.
Then, with a trailer we found, I made three round trips.
//That's 6, plus the attempt with the RV. -GHS
Fatigue at extreme levels.
//...but he managed to make three round trips on a bike with a trailer in these hilly roads without dying. -GHS
And I was furthermore struck down by Touko's words.
The first thing that she said once I led her to her room was,

[Touko]
"...what's even this storeroom?"
//HACK fade to black -GHS

And there, all my strength used up, I collapsed.
