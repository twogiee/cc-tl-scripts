One good thing of countryside is that the evenings are not sticky damp hot.
The wind that slips through the window is cold with moderation, and gentle on the skin.

[Taichi]
"...stomach's empty, innit..."
//No Youko to make him food is very odd. Maybe Youko's starving him because she's so damn jealous; maybe she wants him to bake the potatoes that'll summon Touko - which is odd, but less so considering the nonsense that is her "fight" with Kiri. That, or this is just exactly what happens every evening that Taichi forgets to grab some takeout. Strange he doesn't even have the sweets he supposedly has for emergencies. Maybe that isn't part of his Settei yet... -GHS

While digesting a suitable soliloquy, I keep chronicle in the diary.
//Someone's hungry, if it's not clear. -GHS
GlRlRlRlRlRlRlRlRlRl!
The belly bug steadily repeats its rice, bowl growl.
//Ugougo is also literally seaweed-seaweed, so I'm assuming it's more food puns. -GHS
As if a lion, baring animosity against the cage that surrounds it, unaware of what it imprisons.

[Belly Bug]
『Eat! Eat now ya prick! Devour!』
//Tone switch -GHS

[Taichi]
"Shaddap. What's even this, some sketch?"

[Belly Bug]
『Yer tummy's empty! Chow something! This ain't just my problem yannow!』

[Taichi]
"Short tempered aren't we! Maybe I should do like that octopus in the Sakutarou Hagiwara poem and start eating my own legs. If I manage to eat myself completely without leaving anything behind, then I'll have achieved eternal life!"
//Funnier considering, well. -GHS

[Belly bug]
『That's nonsense that is! Ya pulling my leg now!』
//Making a fool of me (lateral sense) + licking me (literal sense). Adapted so it still fits with food, in a sense. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Whatcha gonna do if I am? Eh?"

[Belly bug]
『Sock ya!』

[Taichi]
"Go ahead and try, you figment of my imagination!"
//Says the guy who gets zubaaan'd by a figment of his imagination pretty much on a weekly basis. -GHS

[Belly bug]
『Don't be belittlin' me! I'm as rambunctious as the son of some entertainer brought up all sweet yannow!』
//...but with all the cage stuff, being brought up in a suite almost makes more sense... still don't see the penis connection I'm pretty sure must exist. See CCC3012B -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ohhh, we got a wise guy here. Well, while you're in the gaol known as the flesh, don'tcha forget that even with your Sweet Guy manners you are as powerless as the son of an entertainer that was slammed in the pigpen to serve his just sentence!"
//Dagnabbit. Butabako, see CCA0009A. -GHS

[Belly bug]
『How dare you! You had to go and say it!』

And with the presence of this two-way communication with an existence most assuredly conceptual, there lies the measure of how much of a human I am.
Is that what they generally call lu**cy perhaps indeed that is so.
//PCP CCB0006 -GHS
Well I don't care! (sobbing)

[Taichi]
"But still I'm really hungry."

What to eat?
To downstairs.
The contents of the refrigerator had become void.
Without electricity, the preservation of anything is impossible.
//Irrelevant, since the fridge is empty for different reasons. -GHS
I rustle in the cupboard.
No bread.
//NER NER HOW'S THAT ALL-FRESH FOOD WORKING OUT FOR YOU NOW JAPEN -GHS
No dried meat.
There were hopes and dreams.
//Neither Want nor Desire. -GHS
...those I completely and entirely cast aside for being absolutely, completely and thoroughly useless.
There was a pepperful of exaggeration.
//"There were some peppers" + "that was exaggerated". -GHS
There was some Solanum Tuberosum (potatoes), too!
                     You got [SAUCE]!
                      You got [SALT]!
                     You got [SUGAR]!
//Centered and tweaked because they're system messages. Of course. Unsure what the sugar's for. No oil??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"We have a feast!"

I line them up over the table.

[Taichi]
"Thank you for the foood!"

Peel... peel...
Unable to resist the appeeling sound of the act, I add salt on a potato I had a-peeled and took a bite.
//Originally: "similarly to the peeling sound", which is sho-ri (vs. salt shiori). Replaced with a pun that should be about as awful. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, this is the taste of a tiny little New Potato then, mnghmngh... so moderately adamantine, almost at the levels of a rock..."
//I don't think the term New Potato is as evident as 新ジャガ is. also hungry nau. んがぐぐ seems to be a reference to Sazae-san, like (possibly) the one in CCA0022. See CCD2002. ...seriously, the stuff I google... -GHS
[Taichi]
"Wait, is this crap even edible?! Don't be pulling my leg!"

I tossed it.

[Taichi]
"Pah! pah! I gnawed it to the bud! This stuff's poisonous! (Seriously.)"
//See Higurashi 1, the "needle in the food" scene. Interesting. -GHS

And that was when I realized,

[Taichi]
"There's nothing to eat?!"

Terror ensues.

[Taichi]
"Right! If we have no bread, then let us eat cake... pffft!"
//As often attributed to Marie Antoinette, see CCX0001. -GHS

A nice gag that will fill the bellies of the starving populace with laughter, no mistake.
That's how much magnanimity people have, don't they.

[Taichi]
"Well, if it's gotta be like this, I'll just order a pizza."

I pick up the telephone.

[Taichi]
"Hello, it's Kurosu and I would like one DoCheSpe size M..."

* DoCheSpe = real word. Stands for Double Cheese Special.
  Really, they call it that.
//In the far, far away land in which Tanaka lives. No, not Japan, since the term doesn't google. Size M left like that, though it probably means Mega, because M is for Masochist. Don't fall asleep now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"They have fallen!"

Bwaaah, I break down crying.
//SFX has better impact than a more literal translation -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh, but I still hadn't finished conquering all their offeriiings!!!"

The life of a human is filled with regrets.

[Taichi]
"Well then, I only got potatoes."

Maybe I should steam them.
I exit to the garden.
//庭には？ -GHS
Using a survival manga as reference, I set up a cooking fire.
//BTW: given Youko is the one that makes food, and there is surprisingly little reason for her to leave him without food today, isn't it curious Taichi needs to go mad to prepare himself dinner? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Done..."

Steaming is too much of a mess, so I settled for roasting.
Here we are, a simple recipe for buttered potatoes:
Start a fire.
//I knew Billy Joel was wrong! -GHS
Dance.
Heat the stones.
//I take it's the ones of the cooking fire. -GHS
Baptize the potatoes one by one.
Toss the tinfoil into which the potatoes are
 wrapped onto the stones while reminiscing of
 your broken heart (improves the taste).
Wait.
Shed tears.
Wait.
Wipe the tears.
Wait.
Surmount the grief to become a stronger person.
Wait.
Cease thy waiting.
Stop thy belly bug.
//Just for rhyme-ish-ing-sorta. -vaguely. -GHS
Remove and place on dish.
Add butter... that I don't have so salt instead.
Sweep away trivial questions like, "well how're
 they buttered potatoes then?"
Devour.

[Taichi]
"Hot-tch-tch."

But delicious.
Alive aren't I, me.
At the front door I could see a person collapsing.

[Taichi]
"Bft!"

I rush over.
The person in question was Kirihara Touko.

[Touko]
"Ngggh..."

While greedily devouring a potato, I look down on Touko.

[Touko]
"Ngggh..."

I began devouring a second potato.

[Touko]
"...somebody..."

I began devouring a third---

[Touko]
"Hurry up and help me already..."

[Taichi]
"It spoke!"
//See CCB2013. -GHS

[Touko]
"Nggh..."

Appears in pain.

[Touko]
"What're you here for?"
[Touko]
"...the smell of food..."

[Taichi]
"Hoh. You followed said smell to here then?"

[Touko]
"......"

She no longer is capable of a response.
//"There was no response" + "The response was dying". -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

Once I finished eating my third potato, I dragged Touko's body over.
//WHAT'S HE GONNA DO TO THIS POOR CADAVER NOOOOO -GHS
Greedily, greedily, greedily.
Touko most greedily devours potatoes.
//Annnd graphics failure again. She should be eating a potato no bigger than her eyes FFS. -GHS

[Taichi]
"..."
//WHY DID I USE EYES AS COMPARISON -GHS

Without adding any flavoring.
Because she didn't seem to have even the time to chew.
A savage, dauntlessly courageous, thorough eating.
//See CCB0008 (I guess) -GHS
In retrospect, Touko was always embarrassed about eating in front of others.
This thing now is a rarity.

[Taichi]
"...Shinden."
//Newly cultivated rice field. Capitalized because name. -GHS

[Touko]
"...mh... mh..."

[Taichi]
"...Kasai."
//No idea what exactly is meant. Returns about some military clan, and this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasai -GHS

[Touko]
"...mh... mh..."

[Taichi]
"...Ugajin."
//God of harvests and wealth (syncretized with Saraswati, and often taking the form of a heavenly woman, a white snake or a fox) -WWWJDIC -GHS

[Touko]
"...what's that you keep talking about now?"

[Taichi]
"The blameless, innocent people of the New Potato Republic that have now become your flesh and blood."
//Step 4. Also part of the Country Founding/immigration subtheme. -GHS

[Touko]
"Huh?"

With bits of potato stuck to her cheek, Touko made a puzzled face.

[Taichi]
"Don't worry about it, it's fine."
[Taichi]
"Their life has been bequeathed."

Press hands together in prayer.
//Not the Western one. -GHS

[Touko]
"...huh?"

[Taichi]
"It's nothing, it's nothing."

She showed a somewhat stumped face,
//Shbopsdkefp3o2reds -GHShbopsdkefp3o2reds
then dug in once more.

[Touko]
"...mnch."

Limbs stiffen.
//Is she coming??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Here, water."

I hand over a bottle of water.

[Touko]
"GlpGlpGlp..."

She chugs down.

[Touko]
"MnchMnch."

She wolfs down once again.
She looks all grown up, but she has the mannerism of a child, this one...
After having flattened seven or eight, finally Touko takes a breather.
//Casual numbers. -GHS

[Touko]
"...I've calmed down now."
//Also, remembering that the potatoes here are small, it's much more understandable how she could eat this many and this quickly. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Welll, that's what's important."

Touko readjusts her sitting position.
//Despite her being standing now. Ooookeeey... -GHS
With her head hung in shame, she rolls up her eyes to look at me.
And so I, too, look at Touko.
Staring fixed.

[Touko]
"...don't look at me!"

She looks down, her face red.
That was so cute.
It made my heart go a bit boom-boom.

[Taichi]
"N-,no I wasn't! I only glanced that way unconsciously!"
//regression to tsundere -GHS

[Touko]
"I'm trying to say something polite here!"
//!!TSUNDERE FIGHT!! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, yes, go on."

[Touko]
"Hm..."

She tries again.

[Touko]
"Th-, th-, th-,"
[Touko]
"...thank, you."

So very awkwardly.

[Taichi]
"No problem."
[Taichi]
"I couldn't even imagine you were flat-out starving."

Touko's face grew even more red.

[Taichi]
"Was it because there was no food in the house?"

[Touko]
"There was, but..."
[Touko]
"I don't really know how to prepare it."

[Taichi]
"What?"
[Taichi]
"But, but, that time, you said you were a great cook..."
//collate dem buts -GHS

[Touko]
"I'm sorry..."
[Touko]
"That... was a lie..."

[Taichi]
"A LIE?!"

Duuun!

[Touko]
"Sorry."

[Taichi]
"Then, those bentos you had weren't made..."
//See CCD2002. But shouldn't he know? -GHS

[Touko]
"The maid made them and I just made it look like I made them."
//There mayd be something wrong with how I made this sentence, but I seem unable to figure out what unaided... -GHS

Dun-duuun!

[Taichi]
"The maid... how old is she?"

[Touko]
"Around 45 years old."
//4+5=9 +1+2+3 (dun, dun-dun, dun-dun-dunnn) =15 =7+8 -GHS

Dun-dun-DUUUN!

[Taichi]
"...my heart fluttered... for the bento... prepared by an old bag..."
//I wonder if THIS is what pisses him off. -GHS

[Touko]
"I'm sorry..."

[Taichi]
"Meanie!"

I broke down crying.
Then,

[Taichi]
"So, if you go back home, I guess there should be some meat, or some canned food."

[Touko]
"What's 'canned food'?"

[Taichi]
"MAJIII!?"
//screw it *chug* see CCC4016, it returns so keeping it like this. -GHS

She doesn't even know of the existence of canned food!?"
She doesn't know the words 'canned food'?
Do those two words never appear together in the Encyclopedia Touka?
//lit. "does the two-kanji word 缶詰 not appear". -GHS
Eh? No, I know that she's rich, but still... ehhh, seriously?
//leave fourth wall alone -GHS

[Taichi]
"Doesn't your caviar come in a can?!"

A question while I shake and tremble with fear.

[Touko]
"It's in jars. Every week, jam-packed in a wooden box sent from overseas."
//Even the most expensive caviar in the world comes in a tin: http://most-expensive.net/caviar-world As a crate like that would run likely $100,000+ a WEEK, I'm leaving this as a rich girl joke. -GHS

That's what she normally eeeeats?!?

[Taichi]
"If you have no cake, then live on bread and caviar, you damn upper class twit!"
//Monty Python rushes in where Engrish fears to tread... -GHS

[Touko]
"Wh-, what are you angry for? And what's this about cake...???"

[Taichi]
"CAVIEEE! Eaten by this woman of all values ignorant! All the time!"

I pity that anthropomorphism.
//"Cavie" -GHS

[Touko]
"Crying, really now."

[Taichi]
"Therefore! I now ask what happened to this proud caviar!"

[Touko]
"This week there's none, no. It wasn't delivered yesterday."

[Taichi]
"Last week's?"

[Touko]
"Last week we didn't eat any of it and it was still sealed, but... I threw it all away. It's perishable."
//Odd, isn't it? Touko wasn't at home for most of that time, because of the Training Camp. Is she the only one who eats it there? Did they just stop ordering it since she wasn't eating it? -GHS

[Taichi]
"BNK!!!"
//Lit. "I'm coming". Going with vapor lock. -GHS

I push out my chest and start to bend backwards,
until the back of my head hits the ground.

[Touko]
"Kyah?! What is wrong?"

While still arcing the back as a bridge, I begin convulsing all throughout.

[Taichi]
"Caviar... thrown away... because it is going to spoil... thrown before it spoiled..."

[Touko]
"You're foaming at the mouth?!"

[Taichi]
"Even though I had lost the entire fortune I had saved up since my days of infancy on Chinese stock..."
//Part 3, Taichi the Failed Speculator -GHS
[Taichi]
"You have just been throwing caviar away!!!"

[Touko]
"What are you doing with all this incoherent and illogical nonsense..."
//Been asking that myself for about 18 months now. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Why you over-rich...!"

Touko's face looks downcast.

[Touko]
"...rich you say, but now it's all meaningless."

[Taichi]
"Sure, suuure, but!"

[Touko]
"Kurosu, you can cook, that's great."

[Taichi]
"Cooking, now, it's just roasting something I rustled up."
//tadakedakedo -GHS

Should be normal to be capable of it.
Though I have had the help of Saitou Ta**o.
//Can't source the Golgo 13 chapter this comes from, if any. -GHS

[Touko]
"...this has become so annoying. All this big effort needed just to live normally."
//See CCD2002. Like having to line up at the cafeteria just to get lunch. -GHS

So declares the rich girl.
This woman's family has a housekeeper.
What you'd call a maid.
That's why Touko's an Ojou-sama.
In other words, she was maintained alive automatically even without doing anything herself.

[Taichi]
"So, Kirihara, you can't live alone then."

[Touko]
"...'ddap."
//Lisp -GHS

A feeble refutation that was an affirmation.

[Taichi]
"Damn automatic people..."

[Touko]
"Hey."

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Touko]
"...me staying here, can't I?"

I could not believe my ears.
She's seriously impaired, this one.
She even said it all naturally.
Then again, there is certainly no one else she could depend on.
Inevitably, she turned to me.
Waaah, so complicated.
Because Touko and I---
Ngggggh (anguish) (pronounced oh no)
//This is where the choice to accept or reject would go. Many of the inaccessible scripts for Week 2 seem to be for that removed choice. -GHS
