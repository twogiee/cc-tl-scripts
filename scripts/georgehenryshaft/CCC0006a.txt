And, as I begin to walk the hills,

[Taichi]
"Mnuh?"

The screeching sound of a tire chafing the ground.
//See CCC0006B (so it works better with the chastity belt) -GHS
Warning signal.
//See CCC3002 -GHS

[Taichi]
"'Cuz I'll letchaaa!"

A most magnificent dodge leap.
Badooom!

[Taichi]
"Propeller-er-er-er-er-er-er-er-er!!!"
//extra RAs x8. Propeller, like ruf, is a child company of Will, who published most of the FlyingShine products including Cross Channel. That sounds less weird considering one Propeller's writers may be mentioned in CCZDXC. -GHS

I was revolving.

[Nanaka]
"What'iiiiiiiiiit!?!"
//Ugggh moe words. -GHS

I am blown away as if I were in a wireworks scene.
When the face is violently riposted into the ground the precious momentum is not lost, and with a pose similar to a Shachinoko I roaringly crash into the trees on the side of the road.
//See CCA0030 -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Sorry, Taichi!!!"

[Taichi]
"...why you be knowing Our name..."

[Nanaka]
"You forgot it all?"

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

I meet the girl's eyes.

[Nanaka]
"Forgot it all about me?"
//A good point to remind that she isn't annoyed Taichi forgot her from previous routes; he forgot her from his time after birth. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Badump!"

Forgot.
Due to my memory loss,
long ago, she might have saved my life.
Shommon.
* Shommon = Taichian for Shoot (the Pro Wrestling and Sumo term) + Common. An upfront challenge posture that is standard among standards.
//Term's actually used in both Sumo and 'normal' pro wrestling. http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%81%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B3 -GHS

[Taichi]
"Isn't what I would need to permit here be at a somewhat freaky level now? Even if we assume that you are a childhood friend who promised to marry me ten years ago!"
//SF, still recurring. -GHS

So I proclaim with stiffly-simmered panache.
//vs. hard-boiled -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Heh heh heh."

Cute kawaiiko-chan.
//So it comes closer to CCC0004B -GHS
Somewhat weird though.
Or should I say, very clearly weird.
And yet she was cute (me = hopeless human).
Shall I entertain her with a first-encounter sexual harassment?

[Taichi]
"And,"

Sqnjmew.
//SFXitis is slowly reaching critical levels -GHS
Milk(er) GET.
//screw it *chug* -GHS

[Nanaka]
"..."

[Taichi]
"...hmmm?"

Sqnjmew, sqnjmew.
The tactile sensation is present.
Yet... what is this feeling...
//See CCB0002 -GHS

[Taichi]
"No way, silicone? It's silicone right?"
//He totally has a padded bra, doesn't he? He does. For cosplay. He totally does. Forget whether he's Youko, he has a padded bra in his Taichi Bag. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Ha-AH!"
//And here's the payoff. Tiny little irrelevant term, but it's Taichi using an affectation identical to his mother's. -GHS

Ker-smack!

[Taichi]
"Ha-AH!"

I'm just being made to fly here.

[Taichi]
"...so, your name?"

[Nanaka]
"Quick to bounce back aren't ya."
//It's easy to bounce back from nothing happening. But the point is, see Sakuraba. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Because I'm used to it."

[Nanaka]
"This one's named Nanaka."

[Taichi]
"Nanaka-chan then."

[Nanak]
"Yep. Nanaka-chan."

An admirably charming greeting pose complete with raising her skirt in a curtsy.
I replicate exactly.
//He would certainly know, given his background. Except... what if he can replicate so exactly because he's still in a skirt after having turned into Youko? -GHS
A mirror's reflection.
//See CCA00030. The hints are unsubtle. -GHS
...of two idiots, to name what the scene turned out to be.

[Taichi]
"...anyway I'm going to school, so let's walk."

[Nanaka]
"Okkieh."

An uniform that I've never seen.
It's very much not of the schools in this neighborhood.
//Likely in the main city. Prolly meets 'those' students on the commute. -GHS
Motor skills seemed good.
I am in the low gear of walking, yet she keeps pace without staggering.
//Does this contradict CCA0002...? -GHS
From the looks of it, a flavored mix of sprightly genki childhood friend bishoujo.
//With technical fetishist terms going mostly-desu. Doing my best to turn this into the kawaii uguu shit we all know it needs be, and it's not because Taichi is about to go further into the meta aspects so if you're lost now that's exactly where you need to be. -GHS
The kind that would come to wake you up every morning.

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh."

Wonderful.

[Nanaka]
"You don't really seem shaken now, are you?"

[Taichi]
"Hm?"

[Nanaka]
"With the world having turned out like this."

[Taichi]
"...I so am."

Can't be expected not to be.

[Taichi]
"I just don't let it come out."
[Taichi]
"Me, well... the less people there are, the more I become my true nature."

[Nanaka]
"......"

[Taichi]
"Because right now I'm taking that everybody's still there, I can preserve myself."
//Going with a less obvious meaning of '知ってる'. Because it's true(tm). -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Right then."
[Nanaka]
"You hate yourself, Taichi, that's it."

[Taichi]
"...hate, not really, but... I don't understand."
//See CCD0023, where he will say it out loud. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Or in truth, I don't understand anymore. I just keep thinking about trifling things."
[Taichi]
"...it's painful, but just a little."

Nanaka's face seemed sad.

[Taichi]
"Whoopsie, gotta cut that out."
//See CCA0003. Borderline PCP. -GHS

I make display of buffoonery as a conditioned reflex.

[Taichi]
"I resolved that if I make a girl cry, it has to be by sexual harassment."

I wipe around her eyes.
//See CCA0013, and below. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"...seriously, I'm not crying."

[Taichi]
"But you were as if to cry."

[Nanaka]
"And from sexual harassment, that's really disgusting."

[Taichi]
"It's an expression of love."
//See CCC3004. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"What, the sexual pranks?"

[Taichi]
"Yeppy."

Puff that chest with pride!

[Taichi]
"I employ sex pranks to express the feelings of love I have for what is beautiful."
//See CCA0002. In a sense, CC is a big sexual prank on the whole world. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because individual idiosyncrasies, however much they may be stereotyped, are something exclusive to one person."
//This "stereotype" thing works better if the person being expressed love to is 2D. See CCA0023, which is on the same theme. -GHS
[Taichi]
"Because it's something I'd call human-like."
[Taichi]
"And also, I don't really have the qualifications to express love to people with a serious face either..."
//See Sakuraba. -GHS

Why did I even end up talking about.
As I'm just human, there are very rare times when my guard slackens out of context.
//See CCA0003. Very specific. -GHS
Man oh man oh man.

[Nanaka]
"...huuum."
[Nanaka]
"First time I've heard that opinion out of you."

[Taichi]
"...first time?"
[Taichi]
"We seriously did have previous meetings?"

[Nanak]
"We did."

A face that seems extraordinarily lonely.

[Taichi]
"When?"

[Nanaka]
"Dunno?"
//Given the time loop, the History of the World interpretation, the Eroge Protagonists Of Unclear Age trope, that is actually the correct answer. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...it's a secret then."
//Mirroring her typical answer -GHS

[Nanaka]
"Maybe it is, maybe."

[Taichi]
"Heh heh heh, no confession equals skirt flipping ya know."

[Nanaka]
"Try it, and I'll riposte you again."
[Nanaka]
"You like it anyway, Taichi."

[Taichi]
"...nguh."

Formidable.
An opponent unflapped by sexual harassment.

[Taichi]
"...annnd I quit."

[Nanaka]
"Uncle?"
//Literally it's that pun between "parent" and "what's this/dear me/etc", again. Works in context and is close enough. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Unflappable opponents make for boring skirt flipping."
//llliiiikkkkeeee yyyyoooouuukkkooo -GHS
[Taichi]
"Ahhh, ahhh, Kurosu Taichi-sama whose fortune is in superficial empty dialogue has ended up talking about something so veeery serious!"

And, I walk on.

[Nanaka]
"Lonely, isn't it."
//She's not referring to this world... -GHS

The voice I heard from far behind.
A sense of physical discomfort.
//Recurring -GHS
I turn back.
An impossible distance,
as Nanaka was traveling right beside but three seconds ago.
Twenty meters. That is not a distance that can be traversed in an instant.
//That's... wait for it... waaaait for it... just around 7 meters per second. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Na..."

[Nanaka]
"...Taichiii!"
//...because these are likely the words she told Taichi right before she gave him up. That's why there's this distance. And those words are... -GHS

She shouts. It reverberates with bitterness. It pounds the chest.
This time, Nanaka was really crying.
//Compare CCA0013 and above. -GHS

[Nanaka]
"I really don't know if it's the right thing to do, but!"
[Nanaka]
"If you wish to turn the world back to normal, then..."
//..."find religion". It's not the Cross World that needs to go back to normal. -GHS

A white fingertip shot out, pointed at me.
No, at something behind me.
The school.
No... the mountain?
The mountain path that we used when going to the training camp is there.
It's almost an animal trail, but it reaches the summit fast.
And right before that,
there is a hokora.
//The location of the hokora is never quite clear. This makes it sound like it's very near the top of the mountain. The overlook ridge should be much before that, and the hokora even further downmountain. -GHS
What is enshrined there I don't know.
It's an ancient, forgotten, tiny little hokora.
//As well as the only explicitly religious construction in the whooole of the VN. -GHS
Once, it might have been that the place was dedicated to some rogue god.
//Of the kind whose graciousness would save you even in case of nuclear war. -GHS
Now, nobody approaches it.
//...he totally fell for Christianity because he likes the aloofness of the Christian God. OK, that's just conjecture. -GHS
There could be anything there.
With the intent of tossing this trifling doubt her way, my sight returns to Nanaka.
//He uses the same term as above. -GHS
She was nowhere to be seen.
//See CCC0005. The mirroring with Youko is nearly perfect here. -GHS
And neither was her bike.

[Taichi]
"......"

It was a quiet new school term, when even the cicadas didn't cry.
