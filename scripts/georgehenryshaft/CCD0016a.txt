"...staaare."
//A watched pot does not boil; but what if you said 'jiii' at it for hours, would it? Find out in the next VN translation! -GHS

Dusting off dust and pride as I am, Kiri's sight is a bit trying to shoot at me as if her eyeballs were a gun, a bit trying to chop me like mincemeat.
//http://thesaurus.weblio.jp/content/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%92%E9%A3%9B%E3%81%B0%E3%81%99 Both are creative ways of saying "she's glaring at me"; mixing in the literal meaning retains imagery and works just fine. First reminds of the crossbow, second of the Knife metaphor used around her multiple times in her route especially. (NOTE: knives may be catspeak.) -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

Shall I start with Kiri then.

[Kiri]
"...what is it?"

A fearfully cold reaction. Outwardly.
I stand in front of her.
I stand a head taller than her, and yet she fearlessly directs her eyesight my way.
That spirit will do just fine.

[Taichi]
"T'eyaaah!"

Outspokehhh!
//[further sobbing rant about the horror that are vertical stripes removed] -GHS

[Kiri]
"!!!???"
[Kiri]
"Wh-, what? Wha-what?"
[Kiri]
"Wh-, why doesn't it go down... eh, eh, eh?!"

In a flap she flaps her skirt down,
But her skirt does not fall calm at all.

[Kiri]
"Sk-, the skiiirt... floating all fluffy! Really, what is this?!"

[Miki]
"Inexplicable discovery..."

[Taichi]
"Clincher's the twist in the wrist."

[Kiri]
"AaAaAaaaAaaaah..."

Feverish haste! Feverish haste!
Rustle rustle! Fluffy fluffy!

[Kiri]
"Th-, the air won't go out!"

[Taichi]
"Well then."

I look at Miki.

[Miki]
"Badump..."

[Taichi]
"To a girlette that so loves her miniskirts, an early Christmas present is just desserts."
//fuck poetry -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah... y-, you will do 'that' to me too...?"

She gets ready to flee.
//See CCD0008B. -GHS

[Miki]
"Ah... no... please let me gooo!"
//You're excused, Miki. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ngh."

Grrr, but she's so helpless dammit.

[Taichi]
"I want to overlook this so badly I'd scale mountains to do so, but... forgive me."
//Not actually an uncommon form, but this is needed because her name is Kawanobe Miki. LOLiLOLiLOLi (laughter for loli-related events). This is actually sort of harder to understand in the original, because she's technically asked him to forgive her in the sense of 'let me go'. -GHS

[Miki]
"Fwaaah, se-, Senpai, calm down..."

I lay fingers on the hem of her skirt.

[Miki]
"The Senpai that Miki likes so much wouldn't do this, right?"
//This is less obvious than some, but it's a very very dark nukige line, this one. It's almost word for word at least in http://vndb.org/v6540. -GHS

Stare!, and I am gazed at fixedly.

[Taichi]
"..."

The screaming of girls moves my heart.
//Another dark nukige line, this one is nearly the same as the one that opens http://vndb.org/v4361. Uh, please don't be suspicious about this knowledge of mine, OK? -GHS
From the back of those tiny hips I want to make wanton push'n'shove.
//Sex, er, see CCC4022? -GHS
Love, therefore desire to break.
I like a lot, therefore I want to bully.
The construction of the male heart is complicated indeed.
//This actually explains his sex-related problem, though I doubt this can be explained clearly to anyone who hasn't experienced the above firsthand. -GHS

[Miki]
"Why do people always need to find it in themselves to fight!"

Grrr, it is as she says.
It's got zilch to do with this but it's a reasonable thing to ask.
The purity in Miki's words made me awake.
//...this is totally what happened at the end of last route, didn't it. -GHS

[Taichi]
"I understand, Miki."

[Miki]
"Senpai, I'm so glad!"

I also bow my head to Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Yeah, yeeeah, Kiri, sorries!"

[Kiri]
"Don't you 'sorries' MEEEEEEEE!!!"
