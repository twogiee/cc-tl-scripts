"Well then now."
//HACK slow to black, then to the bedroom. Someone forgot the BG... again. -GHS

Fire in the candle.
//Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! -GHS
Open the diary.
//Wanted to make these flow, but they're CP'd in CCC4016 where it wouldn't work. -GHS

//HACK the change is still suspect, but... -GHS

But that's just for a moment.
Incredibly enough, the chill vanished in the fog.
//Can literally be read "it's almost a lie: the chill erased Kiri". Left odd. -GHS
The room returning to half-hearted lukewarmth, I begin to dress myself.
And now... I,
CSQ 0 1 1
 - Follow Kiri
