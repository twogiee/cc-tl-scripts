I went into the First Years' classroom,
but there wasn't Kiri nor anyone else.
In the corner of the classroom lays a cardboard box.
It was a copyright-wise dangerous thing on which the words 'Miki House' were drawn in red, rounded Western characters.
//See CCC3019B. Interesting she had this in her class, i.e. from Monday or before, since this is what she seems to use to sneak around. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Let's play with something safer now, come on..."
//As above. -GHS

If I had to guess, it would mean it's just the property of Miki, right?
This toootally ain't about wide-scale sale of children's clothing.
//WEAK!!! -GHS
I try going inside the Miki House.
Why is it that when there's some tight space I just want to go inside it?
//More than the obvious pussy reference, but do remember he likes gaplessness, see CCC0007. -GHS
But this tightness is fine.
//That thing must be HUGE for Taichi to fit into it! Not that it's a problem since it's the MGS cardboard box anyway. Or more like: buy Miki House Children's Clothing! It's one size fits all(tm). -GHS
Waiting.
Before long, Kiri came.
Alone.
Setting down her bags, she stops by the window.
//Hmmm, suspicious term might imply she has the crossbow around already. -GHS
Ensuring that there are no people in her surroundings, she puts her hands under her skirt.
She fixed the cameltoe her underwear is giving her.
//See CCA0003. -GHS

[Taichi]
"............"

She fixed the cameltoe her underwear is giving her.
She fixed the cameltoe her underwear is giving her!
She fixed the cameltoe her underwear is giving her!!
She fixed the cameltoe her underwear is giving her!!!
She fixed the camel*** her underwear is giving her!!!!
She ***** the camel*** her underwear is ****** her!!!!
//Does not seem to get a weird evil meaning if read ignoring the asterisks. The things I try... not that it matters, this is the inverse of what happens in CCA0016, for starters. This is Taichi going Weird. Nothing more, nothing less. -GHS
She ***** *** camel*** her ********* is ****** her!!!!
**************************************************!!!!
//includes spaces -GHS
I animalize.
//Hegel/Kojev and more postmodernism stuff maybe? whatever it's not MK3 for odd reasons. Anyway, if this is him turning into an animal, a beast, then the above are the signs. And it's all perfectly innocent, in the end. -GHS
Camera.
Alas, camera.
How come a camera you didn't bring with... myself?
Irritation. Anger.
The deeply held resentment towards myself becomes a dark wicked flame and swells outwards.
//His first instinct is and remains self-destructive, not destructive. -GHS
WHY! RIGHT NOW! RIGHT HERE! YOU HAVE NO CAMERA!
//The secret of CCC4001 is revealed. It's totally pics of Kiri adjusting a cameltoe taken from the Miki House. Unreset Miki would eventually find this occasion. Once more, the role reversal is attempted. -GHS
Vigorously punctuating a monologue, I lay my self whole into the thunderstorm of deep soul-searching.
And Kiri's shamelessness does not have end with that alone.
She gives a look around her,
ascertained that no one was around, then undid the hook of the skirt.

[Kiri]
"..aHnh."

The skirt falls with a smooth sound.
Exposure of pawnties---
//cutified -GHS
IQ had dropped.
In exchange, my surface area increased (adult joke).
//W000t #4. But compare CCC0007, where the same happens in the hokora. Now, a tight space from which to observe people unnoticed, and if case needed be, control them indirectly: the Miki House is a metaphor for Miki's attempted control of the hokora! Except it's a flimsy fake cardboard box, a concept ripped off from a then-recent videogame, covered in copyright infringing material about - of all things - clothes. That's both indicative of Miki's eternal inability to truly control the power of the hokora, as well as very subtle irony. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...nh... there."

What a sliding down of underwear we had!
And then, they're immediately pulled back up.
My eyes, in that instant, have definitely perceived faint pubic hair!
She gathers up her skirt and wears it again.

[Kiri]
"...hoh, there wasn't leakage."

Leakage? Of what? You're kidding... time of the month...?
The unconcerned silliness of a girl.
Summing up this pwecious situation as being not filthied, but leaking.
//This is actually another Biblical thing. -GHS
It was plenty enough to make me Erectus.
//I don't think that makes him homo. Because he's an animal now! *badum-tish* -GHS
Can't stand this no mooore. No mooore!
Simultaneously with Kiri going to lean over the window,

[Taichi]
"Tah-DAAAH!!!"

[Kiri]
"Kyah?!"

An explosive birth out of the Miki House.
//Adapting this would be outright criminal. This is possibly what also means with the "I'm pregnant" thing in the Miki Sendback. Lowlzi3s. Also, remember he can come out of the box instantaneously due to the fact of fucking metal gears -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ah, Kurosu... senpai!"
[Taichi]
"Tah-DAAAH!!!"

[Kiri]
"Wh-, wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh???"
//See CCB2012. Go on, count 'em. This time he's been a bastard by moving the second 'na' to make nana in the mix. And another connection between our Tsunderes. -GHS

Gooo panic, gooo panic!

[Taichi]
"...I saw it."

[Kiri]
"Wh-, what...?"

[Taichi]
"Kiri no Panties."
//Kiri's panties + Kiri nopan[tsu]. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...gH-?!"

[Taichi]
"How you fixed your cameltoe, and the scene afterwards too."

[Kiri]
"AAAAAaaAaaAaaaah..."
//That's 7xあ and 8xぁ -GHS

Shocked speechless. Get ready to flee.

[Taichi]
"...and your touchingly sweet hair too."

[Kiri]
"Ah-, aghYah..."
//Agyarooo? -GHS

At a loss for words.

[Taichi]
"It's just morning and you're already showing me the good stuff. Thank your, Kiricchi."

[Kiri]
"I-, it's... not what... ngh, ngggh..."

[Taichi]
"But in case you wish to have a personal consultation about that... how about we also have lunch together, maybe."

[Kiri]
"GET OOOOOOOOOOOOOOUT!!!"
//Now she's Touko. With the one in the 'ke', that's 7x2 'e'. -GHS

Forcefully expelled.
