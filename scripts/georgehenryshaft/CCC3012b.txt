...what she's doing I dunno, but,
poking at stuff randomly ain't clever, no.
Rather, the being that is causing this present chill is on my mind.
Inside the house there could yet be... an a-l-i-e-n.
//Eirians come from the faraway star of Eiri. Hmmm, should I formingana that... see CCZAS for more aliens. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hoh hoh hoh..."

Not a single flamethrower I own, wimpish modern Bowie that I am.
//Splitting the difference and going with David Bowie, for which this IS the correct transliteration. We had Michael Jackson and his zombies, we might have Ground Control to Major Tom as well. I know, Space Oddity wasn't about aliens... but 2001 ASO, to which it is inspired, was. And that's about the following century, the evolution of mankind, and lots more related themes. Plus it's Taichi and he'd totally bring that up when it's only this vaguely related, because he's precisely the kind of half-educated twit who would. -GHS
Should I stumble across an alien, I have no weapons of any sorts to oppose them with.
//"I don't believe it is necessary for me to state the personality disorders evident in an individual who enjoys, or more accurately revels, in spraying their enemies with flaming napalm aerosol." Hmmm, fire kills aliens. Interesting in light of what gets lit on fire, see CCA0023A, CCB0022, CCD5001, Tower of Friends. -GHS
Nevertheless!
//In short, if he had a rocket launcher, he'd make somebody pay. -GHS
I take a stance.
I need no weapon.
Not as long as I have the Fist.
//Running punches are particularly effective. Eat it, vid boi! -GHS

[Taichi]
"Has the time to use this in True Combat finally come?"
//Flamethrowers are unneeded to make a Bob-b-que... apply fist liberally! -GHS

I have enduringly endured the unendurable in the Way of Karade.
Calumny - slander - lawsuits place it as a subspecies of Karate.

Countless Comrade-in-Arms had abandoned the Way.
//Some shonen is certainly chuuni, but is all chuuni automatically shonen? I suppose it depends on whether anybody cries if we put all shonen and chuuni inside a forest and set it on fire; in that case, we toss said criers on the fire as well. Problems solved! All of them! -GHS
However, in this present where humanity is about to be exterminated from the Earth, at last has the time of my long-cherished desire come!
//Hmmm... -GHS

[Taichi]
"My fists... are howling!"

While monologuing lines suitable for hand-to-hand combat, I turn towards the floor below.
Unpresent,
that dense intent to kill.
This is no ordinary person.
Toilet... in it is unpresent.
Bathtub... in it is unpresent.

[Taichi]
"...indeed."

First floor storage room... unpresent.
Mutsumi-san's bedroom... unpresent.
//So her bedroom is on the ground floor. -GHS
Ah, dust's been accumulating.
//誇り -GHS
...I'll sweep up a bit later.
Apologies, Mutsumi-san.
I withdraw with a bow.
//HACK back to the living room. -GHS
So, where to next.
There was one room that I had not searched.

[Taichi]
"It can't be."
//HACK back to darkness -GHS

I return to the second floor,
to my room's... closest room.
//Effect -GHS
Onee-chan's room.
//See CCC0033B, it's definitely Youko's. -GHS
My hand is on the knob.
It has been a long time since I last entered.
Ever since Youko-chan left the house.
Slowly I open the door.
I catapult myself into the room and at the same time, I dance!

[Taichi]
"Ha! S'yah! Ter'yaah!!!"

Dust and pride fluttering and dancing.
//誇り still -GHS

[Taichi]
"......"

There is no one.

[Taichi]
"The hell am I doing..."
//He's cleaning up Youko's former bedroom, which was dusty, just as Mutsumi told him to. Actions, not words. -GHS

I was embarrassed.
//Told you it was 誇り. -GHS
I leave the room.
Perhaps because of my boastful struggle in the middle of dust, my throat was parched.
//And 誇り again! And of course he's parched, after working in there for an hour or so. -GHS
I returned to the living room after I drank of drawn watSakuraba was eating a tomato.
* Utilizing New Technology 〜 Real Time Monologue
//http://volatility.exblog.jp/2388607/ Hmmm. See CCX0001, I think that's connected still, but not quite it alone. 飲も 'nomo' is not a complete verb form that I can find. That's where the point of this is. Going with this sort of weird thought pattern interruption. -GHS

[Taichi]
"cH'eRH'YAaaaah!!!"
//Cherry? -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"G'fuh!"

Sakuraba did not release the tomato even after collapsing.
//See CCC0035A -GHS

[Taichi]
"What are you doing!"
//HACK music later -GHS
HACK don't just pop the doll in! -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Listen here."

[Taichi]
"What now?"

[Sakuraba]
"I got sick of curry bread."
//Since curry is Christianity, that means Sakuraba is yet to fully understand what this all means, as well. That's why he'll need Sendback as well. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...listen here now."
//ties with Taichi's next sentence -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Therefore I came to your house, because aren't there tomatoes here."
//Seems like he expected to find tomatoes there, see CCC0035A. -GHS

[Taichi]
"And why did you come to my house for that!"

[Sakuraba]
"I seem to have told Tomoki that I would not need food."
//Therefore, he knows Tomoki would be bringing food to Taichi, at least, including tomatoes; so the ones in CCC0035A et al should be from him. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Wh-, why even?"

[Sakuraba]
"Because I had curry bread."

Ad hoc living, his.

[Sakuraba]
"And with that being like that, I shall be in your care from now."

[Taichi]
"Naze?!"
//TL Note: WHYYYYYY -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"And because of all the aforementioned reasons, it came to be that from that day Sakuraba Hiroshi was to live together with Kurosu Taichi."
//Narration??? -GHS

[Taichi]
"Who said that words don't have understandable meaning! NerNeeer!"
//See CCB2009, same source (uncertain). Well, we're still post-Babel. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Please rent me a room."

This guy... this guy!
This is insane.
I am going insane at how casually insane this guy is!

[Taichi]
"Hu-, huh... you leaving that giant mansion to live here?"

[Sakuraba]
"Yah. Giant but no food."
//Compare Taichi's backstory. Giant but lacking in something needed for living. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ain't it nice."

Preaching the truth of reason to Sakuraba the Obocchama is pointless.
//See CCC0003B. Nope, still serious. As for Obocchama, well, if you can't tell from context what that means you're way beyond screwed. -GHS

[Taichi]
"How about I show you around to your room then."

[Sakuraba]
"Please."

I showed him to the latrine.
//A reminder that in Japan (like the rest of the world, according to anime), toilet and bath area tend to be separate. This has to be the tiny tiny room where only the actual toilet is. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Here is your room."
//HACK don't just pop the doll in dammit! The scripter must've been asleep here... -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Inn'it small."

[Taichi]
"Because it's an eight tatami room."
//Here comes the reading key! The number eight is absurd on its face. It's unlikely even Taichi's room is eight tatami, let alone the damn crapper. This is a 1,5 tatami space at best. -GHS
[Taichi]
"It's a commonfolk's residence so that's how it is."
[Taichi]
"Your room's big, right? You sure your own home ain't better?"

[Sakuraba]
"Big you might say, but it's just around 16 tatami, so about twice this one."
//1+6=7, of course, but this is the start. See below. -GHS

[Taichi]
"16 tatami?!"

What sort of room is this idiot living in!

[Sakuraba]
"On first look it look like it should be at least twice, but... seems my room is unexpectedly small."
//Here it is, one of the most important reading keys in the VN, and it's again assigned to Sakuraba. His room is 16 tatami, which he certainly knew beforehand; but Taichi told him that a 1.5 tatami room is actually 8, as a troll. By trusting Taichi, and concluding that his 16 tatami room is more like 3-4 tatami, he proves that Taichi cannot be taken literally without the math no longer adding up. Most damning is how specific this is: Taichi's 8 is an open lie and troll, while there's no reason to doubt Sakuraba's 1+6=7. 8 is a lie, and 7 is the truth. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Pay some attention you!"

This guy maybe just ain't a primate at all.
//Meaning he doesn't descend from them, and isn't a human anymore... which doesn't have many meanings; either he's a monster like Taichi, or he's of a higher bloodline than Adam's. -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"For my 12th birthday, Daddee gave me the room with the best sun exposure."
//Not sure what the point of this is, if there's one. -GHS

"Daddee"?!
//He calls the Father very intimately, this guy. -GHS
This guy's family is totally weird... and my belief of that was renewed.

[Taichi]
"Say, bastard... how much's your allowance?"

An inquiry with an unconsciously inserted slur.
//Made fit by modification. -GHS
Incidentally, with obligations to the resourceful Mutsumi-san, I receive about 20,000 yen monthly.
//~$200. Who knows how much they're paying her for keeping mr. 84% here (plus her second unclear but frankly suspicious job), and that's excluding all the money that the guy likely had before he wasted it all on bad market calls. -GHS
Plus food expenses.
The waterline of my living standard's not bad at all.
//Can't leave out a literal reference, see CCC3012A. Sorta mixed metaphor, but fits the tone of the scene anyway. -GHS
I felt quite proud about this.
//誇り yet once more. Pride goeth... -GHS
If I felt in the mood, I could buy every month one pair of Hit Uni*n manufacture's Buruma-667-N (model number), rare, out of production and with prices known to have sudden jumps in recent years!
//See CCA0023. Now: is it his buruma fetish that makes him hallucinate his mother in buruma, or is it his mother telling him about her buruma when he was an infant that caused him a buruma fetish? ...I can't believe I actually wondered that. I hate you, Japan. *resigned sigh* 6-6-7 seem like they would need examination, but that's a real buruma model number and are possibly just an irrelevant real world reference, unless they go 6+6=12-> 3, 7+3=10, and therefore references to 3 and 10 (which I don't point out, though there's a few). True trolls never sleep. -GHS
Students that could maintain a Fetish Life of that kind are certainly not many.

[Sakuraba]
"It's not like I get all that."

Having said that, however, Sakuraba...

[Sakuraba]
"500,000."
//Taichi gets 2[0,000], Sakuraba 5[00,000] 2+5=7 -GHS

[Taichi]
"CONFISCA-CHUUUUTE-ING!"
//HACK independent BG shake -GHS

I revolved into a collapse.

[Taichi]
"RI-, RIARII?" (re-, really?)

[Sakuraba]
"IESU." (yes)
//Yes, "イエス" can be read Jesus. -GHS

[Taichi]
"What entertainer are you the son of, you bastard!
//See CCB2002. HOLY SHIT SAKURABA IS THE BELLY BUG -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Why angry."
[Sakuraba]
"Number one, I am not an entertainer."
//Not an entertainer's SON. Then again, that's true: he's not comic relief, he's Mr. Exposition. -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"As far as I go, I am I."
//Just for sillies -GHS

[Taichi]
"That line there you should spit out as a splendid self-affirmation after being long tormented by the significance of your own existence!"

500,000 he gets.
That's derailing from the proper course.
//See CCB0005. Interesting. -GHS
...wait a second!

[Taichi]
"...say, what would you do if I told you the rent's five million, paid in advance."

Sakuraba shakes his head.

[Sakuraba]
"I don't have that much on hand."

[Taichi]
"...then, what if I told you to give me the money you have on hand now?"

[Sakuraba]
"It's just some coins, you sure?"
//Since it IS coins. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Yep."

He takes out his wallet.
//But we know he totally has a purse... -GHS
I take it from him.
I see, indeed they are coins.
There's a jingle-jingle of a sound.
//There's a bicycle-bicycle sound... see CCA0002. ~yes~ -GHS
I sigh in relief.
The fire of jealousy abates.

[Taichi]
"Hahah, looks like Obocchama has moments of poverty too, then."

Sakuraba smiled peacefully.

[Sakuraba]
"Well yeah. You can call me rich, but it's like that."
//Works better in CCC4016 -GHS
[Sakuraba]
"Same as how rooms are like that in the commonfolk's residences."
//In other words, get ready because this'll be as much of a joke as that was. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Hahahah."

[Sakuraba]
"Hahah!"

An exchange of laughs,
thump, arms are crossed,
//Not with each other, it seems. -GHS
and friendship was deepened.

[Taichi]
"Anyway, at this point having money is meaningless innit."

[Sakuraba]
"Certainly."

[Taichi]
"Say hey, haven't I lent you coin so many times now."

[Sakuraba]
"Then this is repayment."

[Taichi]
"Meaningleeess."

[Sakuraba]
"Lent things get returned."
//See CCC3012A -GHS

[Taichi]
"Damn the man of integrity you are. But well, let's say it's returned in memoriam."

We snicker together as if babbling brooklets.
//...K... -GHS
I open the wallet.
Sure enough, there was no paper money inside.
Inside there were fifteen gold coins, ten thousand yen each.
//HACK to black. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Mister Yeeen!!!"
//http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A6%8A%E5%8E%9F%E8%8B%B1%E8%B3%87 -GHS

Swooned.

[Sakuraba]
"What is it?"

[Taichi]
"Hyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyhhh!!!"
//With the one in the 'hi', ぃx16 1+6=7 -GHS

I thrashed around like a caterpillar.
The hell's this walleeet!
First time I see something this impossibleee!
Looking closely, they weren't only ten thousand yen gold coins.
//Ah, the coins are celebratory of Japan because he's extremely Japanese, connecting back to the Real Japan As Narnia reading. -GHS
HACK NVL mode. The engine does NOT like lines that start with a single number, so those start with a space. -GHS
 8 x 100,000 yen gold coins commemorating the
60th year of the Showa Emperor on the Throne.
//1986-1987. This is another strong hint that this takes place in 1998, as there were 10th anniversary coins of the following Emperor just 1999. He can't have these in 1986, and it'd be odd he wouldn't have those in 2009. -GHS
 7 x 100,000 yen gold coins commemorating the
enthronement of the Emperor.
//1991. No specificing as, this being 1998, there's only one Emperor this could be referring to. Also, the first two figures out are "8" and "7", and although of different year, they're both 100k yen coins. -GHS
 2 x 50,000 yen gold coins commemorating the
Wedding of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.
//1993. -GHS
 4 x 5,000 yen silver coins commemorating the
International Garden and Greenery Exposition.
//1990. -GHS
 3 x 5,000 yen silver coins commemorating the
Wedding of the Crown Prince.
//HACK ADV mode -GHS
All these and no more.
//HACK back to Sakuraba -GHS

[Taichi]
"You stupid or something!"

[Sakuraba]
"I couldn't really use them to do shopping."

[Taichi]
"Well, obviously!"

This guy... this much money and so readily...
Could it be that, when it comes to money, inside Sakuraba's head... 100,000 yen are not much... not much.. not much...? (echo)
//See CCZDXC -GHS

[Taichi]
"But?"

If, before the Fall of Mankind, in the times when money still had significance, I had only just once extorted him some money...
//Going with that specific meaning for obvious reasons -GHS

[Taichi]
"oUUoUUoUUoUU!"
//x16 -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"Why crying?"

[Taichi]
"OOOOOOooooh!"

God exists as my personal bully!
That was the earnest regret spree of mine.
//Ostracismfest returns! Ah, wait, it was never there... -GHS

[Taichi]
"I had enough... let me sleep..."
//See CCB0006 -GHS

[Sakuraba]
"OK, thank you for the help."

Sakuraba confined himself in the latrine.

[Taichi]
"...sigh."

So tired.
Well, that guy's himself.
He'll forget this after one night and he'll be off who knows where, no mistake.
He's got vagabondism after all.
The tomatoes had been scarfed down.
The one that was left I eat myself. Just right for a midnight snack.
A presence behind me.
//Not to forget what started the script. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...Sakuraba? Already feeling like you want to leave?"
//HACK earlier Youko -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

[Taichi]
"Youko-chan?"
//Odd that Youko doesn't go kill Kiri when Taichi decides not to follow her, isn't it. -GHS

She stood in the living room.

[Taichi]
"What do you want at this hour of night?"

And in my house, when she was told not to come in.

[Youko]
"Taichi."

The mood is wrong.

[Taichi]
"What... is it?"

Youko-chan is... just like... like she was at that time...
//A rapist and a cowardly manipulator then. Hum, what character are those words usually (and erroneously) associated with out there...? -GHS

[Youko]
"...Taichi..."
//HACK zoomed everything -GHS

I am approached.

[Taichi]
"Wa... wait...?"
//HACK de-zoom Youko (and BG, since it looks silly otherwise) -GHS

I step back.
//HACK out with the doll. -GHS

[Youko]
"Taichi!"

I was being embraced.

[Taichi]
"...!"

[Youko]
"Taichi..."

I don't understand this at all.
//See CCC0045A. So Nanaka thinks this is Week 1, while Youko seems to think it is... -GHS

[Taichi]
"What... do you want..."
//HACK doll back -GHS

She, however, quickly distances her body.

[Youko]
"...on the lips, piece of tomato."
//See CCC0000. Admittedly, this might be the only real line in the whole thing, but... remember CCC0035A, still odd he has no problem with the red of tomatoes and this might be important. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Eh?"

Her head became one with me.
//Just sound weird. -GHS
Her tongue latches on the edge of the lips.
And then, continuing, to the lips...

[Taichi]
"Hold it."

Before she reaches, I grab and push her off from the shoulders.

[Youko]
"...Taichi. ...Taichiii..."
//See CCC0000. Mommy the emotional vampire... -GHS

So rare,
//See CCC000 again. -GHS
for things to become so unstable.
//See CCA0003. -GHS
My lower abdomen ripples with heat.
//See above. -GHS
It's the response to this weak part of her, who is always so strong.

[Taichi]
"Not happening!"
//HACK return, no change in doll -GHS

[Youko]
"But."

[Taichi]
"...we decided that we won't do it in this house."
[Taichi]
"As follows from the promise we made with Mutsumi-san."
[Taichi]
"I keep my promises."
//Hmmm, see CCC045A, but... -GHS
[Taichi]
"And I will have you keep them, too."
//HACK other zoom. -GHS

[Youko]
"Mutsumi is no more."
//I wonder if she's even looking over this obvious attack he's having. Probably not. -GHS

[Taichi]
"The promise still EXISTS!"

The voice raises until a shout.

[Taichi]
"It still exists, inside of my heart."

[Youko]
"......"

[Taichi]
"I will decide whether or not this promise disappears."
[Taichi]
"You are someone else. I decide with my own volition what is my responsibility."
//Important that it be left literal, since she of course doesn't agree that they're different people. -GHS

[Youko]
"Again... with saying that thing..."
//The "someone else", see CCC3004. -GHS
[Youko]
"Taichi is a bully."

[Taichi]
"You will now please leave, I hope."
[Taichi]
"You simply cannot come inside this house."
[Taichi]
"...it's out of the question for you to be consoled by me."

[Youko]
"..."
//HACK out with the doll now -GHS

Wordlessly,
Youko-chan leaves,
stopping once to look at my face.
Her mask of scant expressions is smooth, that neither discouragement nor disappointment stick to it.
And yet, inexplicably, to me she appeared to be horribly worn out.

[Taichi]
"'night."
//HACK back for a moment. -GHS

[Youko]
"...'night, Taichi."
[Youko]
"I love you."
//See CCA0005A -GHS

She vanishes.
Still in the posture into which I was chased, my back slid onto the front of the refrigerator to the floor, until I was nearly sitting.

[Taichi]
"What the devil was all that."
