There is no one.
//HACK disable sky -GHS
Alone, I unfolded and spreaded out my packed lunch.

[Taichi]
"Whew."

Packed lunch was enough for two, as usual.
With not a thing to do, I go again to the rooftop.
Kiri was there,
taking in the view of the outside world from the fence.
Paramnesia kidnapped my awareness to the distant past.
//HACK Flashback intro. -GHS
Summer was also in its ending,
the cicadas still conspicuously noisy.
Cries loud like slaps in the face.
Straining their voice to make it known that they are summoning the last of their life force.
It was a Summer tinged in the dregs of life.
Kiri was on the rooftop,
alone,
crying.
Even from the back, that shaking of the shoulders is unmistakable.

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu... senpai?"

She does not hide her tears.

[Kiri]
"Yutaka... Yutaka, he... fell from here..."
//Notice she's not even remotely suspecting him, despite having seen him. It's only ex-post facto rationalization from what happens next. Marvelous cross-conversation. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Ahhh..."
//HACK dim screen -GHS

She knew.
//This line makes literally little sense: knew what? of course she damn well knew Yutaka had died. That Yutaka had fallen from the rooftop it should be easily understood. The point here is that she knows THE EXACT SPOT. And Taichi recognizes this all the way from here. This is why he sounds so worried in CCC3023. -GHS
There was no one who didn't,
here in this town.
In society at large, a student leaping off to his death on his own would be newsworthy, in some way.
Guardians would press the school with questions, so as to bring to daylight who was in the wrong.
//More than its share of sarcasm here. -GHS
And the school, then, would try to avoid responsibility.
But at Gunjou there is none of that.
No one in society would press questions, and the school would not dodge them.
Some humans somewhere took responsibility.
//For coldZ. -GHS
To the world, the dangerous boys and girls of Gunjou and all that is around them could do whatever they wanted with themselves.
//Which is why Kiri repeatedly assaulting Taichi with what may be a still relatively nasty BB gun is frowned upon, but not necessarily cause her particular trouble. -GHS
Mourners, a mere few.
//HACK back to normal -GHS

[Kiri]
"No one... no one... is even sad... for all the feelings that we had lived with... no one!"
//You skipped the second to last ellipses, Matsuryu-chan. -GHS

There was a rare excitement here.
//Hers, and his sexual one due to it being the way he dodges emotional impact. -GHS
One week had already passed since Yutaka's death.
//Obvious comment here. -GHS
Kiri's grief had come behind schedule.
//She suppresses her pain, in other words. Just like Taichi does. See CCC4006. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Say, Kiri, I'm wondering... was Yutaka happy?"

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"I'm wondering, was that guy happy, even in his own way?"

An usual question to ask,
but,
the meaning was wholly and damnably the opposite.

[Kiri]
"...always, he was always feeling bitter."

[Taichi]
"Truly, always, bitter?"
[Taichi]
"There were never times of happiness, not even one instant?"

[Kiri]
"Well..."

There were. No mistake.

[Kiri]
"...since he became friends with you, Senpai... he seemed to be smiling..."
//HACK earlier angry Kiri -GHS
[Kiri]
"But he did not recover in the slightest!"

Her tone gains strength.

[Kiri]
"He didn't recover at all, not from all the anguish he had suffered!"
//She possibly just means all that had happened at their previous school that got them sent there. But if she does have the insight that she's alleged to have, she does know, deep down, already. That's why she's easily convinced. -GHS

[Taichi]
"Therefore, Kiri-chin, you think that the life Yutaka was living had no value, do you?"
//That's a much odder question. What does he care whether she thinks Yutaka had a worthless life? Part troll, part him wanting to know if she's over him. -GHS

[Kiri]
"No, it's... not like that..."

[Taichi]
"...so I might say, however, sadness is not something rational."

I was puzzled, too,
as to how to treat Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Crying is fine you know."
//HACK sky -GHS

I look up at the sky.
An instant passed before I could understand that the pure white my vision was buried in was an enormous cluster of cumulonimbus.

[Taichi]
"At least, before Summer ends."

Along with the last moments of the cicadas' lives.
Kiri must have heard thousands of feelings within that meaning, one after the other.
//HACK still unneeded -GHS

[Kiri]
"...bwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
//14xA considering the one in 'wa' -GHS

Eyes downcast, grabbing the hem of my shirt, and screaming out.

[Kiri]
"Yuta-nii... he died... he's dead..."

A wail of tears.

[Taichi]
"......"

'Yuta-nii'.
//ゆ。 -GHS
He was her beloved onii-chan, that's what he was.
Living magnificently even if on one leg.
Kiri's parents---
The face I saw on those two at Yutaka's funeral was that of faint relief.
Did Kiri even notice that?
I believe that she did realize that, and no mistake.
Whatever hardship their eyes met, the two would have supported each other.
As if they were halves.
Kiri is only an half, yes.
Just like I am...
//Ex-bully Yutaka (who is not ex- in Taichi's eyes) is causing Kiri's suffering, if indirectly. What comes next in this pattern? -GHS
Except Kiri seemed to have wished for that.
//In case someone didn't see CCC0000 as rape... -GHS
Right now, strong emotions are depriving her of vigor.
But should someday the sadness grow faint, she will be searching for that half that she expects to be there, that must be there.
//HACK THEY'RE IN THE SKYYYYYYY -GHS
Yutaka and Kiri.
//HACK normal sky -GHS
They were alter egos.
Kiri has no sin,
//See CCA0021 -GHS
but I... my monster was already stirring.
//HACK to rooftop -GHS

[Taichi]
"Kiri..."

Hands move on her back.
//Impersonal -GHS
Violent emotions make enemy warning mechanisms less sharp, and Kiri does not notice.

[Kiri]
"Bwuhhh... bwhaaaa..."

Little by little, her emotions were transforming into calmness.
By then, I had completely hugged Kiri.

[Taichi]
"Kiri... lonely?'
//There we go. -GHS

[Kiri]
"...?"

[Taichi]
"Lonely, aren't you."

[Kiri]
"...Kurosu-senpai?"

[Taichi]
"I am empty. So very much."

If I look down those small features of hers,
I can see a pair of obsidian stones, full with sadness to the depths, moistening her face with thin salty water.
//黒曜石, AKA "see CCC0000 again". -GHS

[Taichi]
"I think Yutaka was happy, you know. Because you were there too, Kiri, so he could forget about the bad things."
[Taichi]
"He was happy until his last, that's what I believe."
//IOW, he also sorts of blames Kiri for this. But given he's trying to (erroneously) make her into his Alter Ego, this resentment appears minor compared to the flurry in which he's trying to rescue Kiri from him even after he died. -GHS

I bring her face close.

[Kiri]
"......eh?"

A small show of consternation,
faces overlapping as if crossing.
//Cymbalism. -GHS
Her lips are stolen.
//See CCC0011C. How is this not her first kiss? Odd. -GHS

[Kiri]
"......?!?"

Her limbs rebel.
I hugged her with strength.

[Kiri]
"...nHah!"

Kiri breathing grew labored.
Pushing her against the fence, I continue to suck her lips.

[Kiri]
"...fhWhah... no... can't!..."

The surprise had stripped Kiri of the ability to think.
No resistance worth mentioning.

[Taichi]
"Lonely?"

[Kiri]
"...eh?"

[Taichi]
"Lonely, aren't you?"

[Kiri]
"...don't... get it..."

I kiss.
Second time.
This time I go invade the inside of the teethridge.
And at the same time, my hands go inside her skirt.

[Kiri]
"Nh... nh, NNNNH?!"

Suddenly, resistance gains strength.
//There's the inappropriateness of the moment, but... could it be that she was in her period as well, a year before? Should still be around the first week of the month or so. Considering that she obviously likes Taichi, and her thinking he killed Yutaka is ex-post facto bullshit from this scene, just like Yusa it could just be that she's rejecting him for reasons that aren't transparently Taichi's fault. -GHS
Kiri pushed me away.

[Kiri]
"P-, please stop this!!!"

[Taichi]
"......"

I think I am making a faint smile. Definitely.
//HACK angry Kiri -GHS

[Kiri]
"You are..."
//"A filthy rotten murderer". And yet... -GHS

I could see how the the shock was slowing being covered up by disgust.
//HACK independent doll shake -GHS

[Kiri]
"...!!!"

She runs away.
//No attempt to confront. No response. Not unexpectable, given the circumstances, but... not quite in character either. The response will come next script, when Kiri shows her true self to him, with similar consequences to him. -GHS
Passing right underarm.
//And Taichi the martial arts trained multiple murderer und ebul serial rapist just lets her go. -GHS
The door creaks.
The door shuts.
//HACK so the first SFX will actually play. -GHS

[Taichi]
"...hahah."

I cover my face with my hands.
I see, it's certain, this is very bad.
//See CCC3025 now. Specific wording seen in reference to Youko. -GHS
The edges of my mouth lifted in apparent inhuman cruelty.
//HACK flashback exit whiteout into blackout -GHS
I ended up estranged from Kiri.
She nearly stopped showing face at club.
There were times when Miki would forcibly bring her along, but she avoided me.
//And what did Kiri tell her? Who knows. Maybe that's when she decided to be the Villain. -GHS
Conversations vanished, connections terminated.
And that... was one of the things that did happen---
