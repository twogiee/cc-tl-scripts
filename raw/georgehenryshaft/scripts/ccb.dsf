//I've commented out the 100% dupes (all hand verified to be so) and called the scripts from week 1, to avoid having to do 3000+ lines of copypasta. Some of these "new" scripts have obvious errors and appear to be copypasta from older revisions, too. Also, messed about and made it so the FB scripts would detect post-week 1 status and change accordingly.
//The only "problem" with this is that now the game thinks that Week 2 Misato route is still called Cross Channel and records that as the save game name, rather than Downfall. I think it just checks the letter after 'cc' in the script file name. -GHS
