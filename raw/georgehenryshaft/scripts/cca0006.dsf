The wind blew,
//"Wind" is also "pretension/deception". In my first altogether-too-adapted version, I experimented with using "bluff", which the wind doesn't do but sorta-sounds like it should, but decided against it in revisions. It's completely impossible to notice unless considering the meta-implications of the rooftop being the place closest to Heaven but the hokora, and metaphorically, the place where interpersonal communication takes place - the wind is part of the disturbance, the lies, the communicative difficulties, the language barries, and all that that the exposure to the elements (sun as well) and the Penelopean (sysyphean?) effort of the building of the antenna.

Ahead in my line of sight, standing apart from the large water tower on the staircase with which it shares the foundation, stood a large antenna.
//This line is odd. The water tower described as "spacious" seems just not appropriate. I'm sort of forcing this reading, because it does sound like it's being described as separate from the staircase, which contradicts the BG of the outside of the school: the water tower is clearly on top of the staircase.
//And the antenna is clearly on a different level from the staircase, so how it can share foundation I simply don't know. Plus there's those three steps before the antenna, so, dunno. Anyway, there are Two Towers in this place close to God and the outside world: it's a Tolkien reference. -GHS

Although pretentiousness for the sake of laughter seems to be in Tanaka's style, and it further continues the undercurrent of criticism towards this kind of writing when used for its own sake, it's worked in the plot: this is Taichi not taking this seriously in the slightest and refusing to let heavy moods settle in.

//Nanaka's panties are pure white, so it's more references to her. Despite Misato's being obviously white, they'll later be referred to vaguely blue. This I have nothing: maybe Taichi IS just colorblind. That last one sorta reminds of the Shimura phenomenon, but I suspect it just means "he'll drool whenever panties are in front of him regardless of color, unless he's giving random critiques".
