//Find the right way down through the maze, to the food, then find the exit. Push the exit button. If the food tastes awful, don't eat it, go back and try another way.

//They want the same thing that you do, really, they want a path, just like you. You are in a maze in a maze, but which one counts? Your maze, their maze, my maze. Or are the mazes all the same, defined by the limits of their paths?

//Existence is simple: find the food, push the button, hit the treadmill.

//But sometimes it gets much harder. Sometimes the food makes you sick, or you can hear nearby feet racing you, urging you on. Sometimes the button only gets you landed right back in the beginning of the maze again, and the food won't satisfy.

//There is only one path and that is the path that you take, but you can take more than one path.

//Cross over the cell bars, find a new maze, make the maze from its path, find the cell bars, cross over the bars, find a maze, make the maze from its path, eat the food, eat the path.

//桜庭「おい、太一」
Sakuraba: "Hoy, Taichi."
//This beginning part is, besides the troll and the first warning that Taichi isn't "right" yet (and will never be, for that), a very good test of reading comprehension. Being able to spot all the parts of the story and flashback this is made up from, and most importantly how Taichi has modified them, gives an excellent reading key for exactly the kind of similarities, overlaps, and connections that need to be made throughout. If you 'get' how this is just a riff on the same verse, you might 'get' the harder parts of this. -GHS

Denatured Consciousness.
Abnormal mental condition.
Internal mental status functions expressing
thoughts and emotions autonomously, visible in
many possible ways of which one example are their 
expression through oddities of speech and conduct.
Acquiring an overwhelming feeling of omnipotence
and experiencing visual hallucination close to
tangible apparitions or ghosts is possible.
Religious experience trip trance... etc.
//...turns it's reliable, BUT it's smeared with layer and layer of bullshit, see CCA0015C: he's just mad in just the way I've been describing until now. Oddities of speech and conduct aren't just the bullshit seen right in this sentence there (ain't it just meta?), but also hallucinations on the level of Nanaka, and possibly of anyone and everyone else. See above for the "feeling of omnipotence", AKA assimilating with the world.
//The casual reference to 'religious experience', right below the near-direct reference to Nanaka, hints that Taichi Is Mad isn't quite the bottom of this rabbit hole; after all, "he was molested as a child" is sort of weak, at least compared to the idea that humans are broken in a similar way to his all the way from the beginning, and that there's no fixing mankind but struggling on until the end while hoping for something greater to be true. -GHS

What she left him was also a big finger pointed at the hokora, which is about Christianity and religion. By Rule of Greek Chorus(?), the same was true of the Tasaki Store owner.
