//According to the Materials Book, this was published in P-Mate in the August 2003 issue, meaning at least a month before game release, and possibly simultaneously with the updated "Deus Ex Chaos" trial edition, see CCZDXC. This is fairly obviously a deleted flashback that has been revised to read as a short story; at times, it reads blatantly first person.
//There's multiple reasons for the cut that I see. The scene serves little real purpose outside seeing the characters have a drink and chat about nothing. Miki and Kiri's joining has big impacts in CCC3004, and having it again here is pointless. The characterizations are off: Misato and Touko, in particular, are rather off character, and Taichi just ignoring Kiri's antics even more so. Maybe preliminary, maybe troll.
//There's at least two positives with keeping this in the VN: one, it clarifies a certain line in CCA0013, hinting that what Taichi wanted in there wasn't "juice" but alcohol; two, it explicitly describes Taichi as a 'dagger', clarifying another interpretation for the † symbol, as well as a line in CCX0001 - when he stops being this 'dagger'.
//This scene wasn't reinserted or reused in any version, and therefore doesn't have associated voices. The fanmade reimplementation was sort of heavy-handed with its effects at times, so I edited it even heavily in parts. In particular, I removed the voices as they sound off when the rest is silent, and added graphics from the original text version. Still, credit to whoever did it! -GHS
