//This script is based on a fanmade scenario circling 'round the net, just like the Amaterasu Translation version was. All of the script commands have been rebuilt from the Xbox 360 release, however, and nothing remains of the fanmade version but about 95% of the original transcription. That's because even its latest edition had its share of typos, and the script in the 360 version was edited and lines here have been changed accordingly. This won't match the Materials Book entirely either.
//The other big difference is that many voiced-only lines, which were introduced entirely arbitrarily by whoever did this originally, were never part of the story in the first place. This especially affects the ending, which was entirely added by whoever did this and was wholly non-canon.
//There were some clever graphical effects, though, so kudos for those.
//As for the technical side of this, the rebuilding is only about 95% accurate. Some effects are still relatively simplified, especially around Miki's crucifixion. The CGs will not fit the full screen, since Another Story was designed for the 360 and therefore for a 16:9 video ratio. Also missing are a few camera pans for BGs (useless with the full screen), and the dolls cut below the knee, which would've given the characters a bit more 'distance' from the screen than the average one here.
//That's because those dolls look better in 16:9 ratio; the "normal" dolls seen in the PC version don't actually exist there. There's those distant dolls, dolls cut much higher than those on PC, and dolls that pretty much fill the screen. Curiously, they just made complete sets for all three for all characters, and at least in the main scenario and Another Story, 99% of those aren't used at all.
//There ARE some distant dolls used sporadically in the main scenario, however. -GHS

They say that if the cellphone shows three antenna bars, the reception of EM waves will be perfect.

Sadly, it's hard to say if this CG shows something obviously absurd or if it's really really cheap graphics. That fire is GINORMOUS and the bodies don't seem to be laid in ways that make sense. And all the visible bodies are obvious, awful 3D models of adult males, when there's only two that could possibly near-fit into that category.

Someone, possibly the god called coincidence, overlapped two sheets of paper and shoots 'em dead with a thumbtack.

This is supposed to be the Worlds Crossing... but this doesn't actually explain why everyone was gone before the worlds crossed, or why so many things change in ways that are consistent with the 'other' world. Outside of this being in Taichi's mind, at least. Paper is read Kami, in fact, "two sheets of paper" is read "the God of Japan". The reason for this is Japan. See CCX0001, this part has been integrated there now.
//That last term is seen at the end of CCA0013, when Taichi wins over Yusa's favor with a single handkerchief (which is usually found folded, dot dot dot). Though it does literally mean "to shoot dead", it is most often used in this meaning of "conquering/overcoming" or "winning [over]". -GHS

Plus, no one but the six people known to play along with him ever even hint at seeing or hearing of her. Those are the virtual images of concepts, namely his own tragedy (Youko) and his own salvation (Nanaka). No more. However, the troll is that he's just hallucinating them after murdering everyone, but I suspect few will be fooled by that at this point. -GHS

//本来は「INVISIBLE MURDER INVISIBLE TEARS」編の、また別の可能性ルートとして検討していたものですが、これを投入すると美希ルートばかりが豪華になってしまうことと、視点トリックとしてたいした意味がないことを考慮し、仕様から外しました。
It was initially considered as an alternate
possible route for chapter "Invisible Murder,
Invisible Tears", but had this been included,
the Miki route alone would have become far too
extravagant, and keeping in consideration how
the viewpoint tricks didn't have much of a
point, it was removed from the specs.
//See CCX0001. This actually underlines what that line meant - it's lingo. The viewpoint tricks would be the beginning moege and the denpa moege, but also all the stuff above being just his hallucination isn't impossible. -GHS

//また「川向こうの死体」「太一の白髪・着物」「みみみ」あたりの伏線回収も兼ねています。
Furthermore, there are elements that also
serve as payoff for foreshadowing such as
the body beyond the river, Taichi's white
hair and kimono, and "Mimimi".
//Given the sentence above it's actually not quite clear whether any of those things are actually intended to have payoff here or whether these things are more troll. The body beyond the river being nonexistent makes more sense as it reveals Miki's lies and Kiri's credulity, though Taichi's white hair and kimono would be what makes Kiri and Miki think it's him in a simpler (but false) explanation; the name Mimimi doesn't have any meaning that's explained here. Curiously, 兼ねて also means "to find difficult", but outside of blatant troll, I can't see where that reading would fit. -GHS

concept of "Taichi B recovers and then, with

//Taichi B should be the Taichi we see here - which isn't a separate Taichi, if there's a separation it's between Taichi Full (spirit + body, sinner but redeemable) and Taichi Of This World (the pure irredeemable sinner).
//The plan seems to have been that this Taichi would either participate with the rest, or be the actual killer. Of course, if this is just Real Taichi having a nervous breakdown and recovering, all that's not been written is the exact part where we'd see that. If the troll is that the "8" mentioned are just his hallucinations, then the entirety of CC takes place in his mind, and that's a valid if obviously inadequate troll of an explanation. Again, that part having not been written explicitly doesn't exclude it from being what happens.
//Besides, it's still not as trolly as the Sakakibara diary. -GHS
