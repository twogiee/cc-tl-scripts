The train station.

And quite a run-down one at that.

But the lack of litter was some consolation.

The kouban......is very close to here.

An 'On Patrol' sign had been hung up, and no one was in there.

No one goes past the station.

This station is nothing but a connection between the city and the residential district to begin with, so it's never that busy.

TP



So I walked down the center of the road.
TP



Taichi: "......"
TP



There's no one to assign the blame.
TP



Why is that?
TP



Think about a world like this:
TP



No matter what crime you stain your hands with, no one will ever blame anyone, and you'll never have to be blamed.
TP



A lawless world.
TP



But I'm the only one here right now.
TP



In a world with just me, what kind of crimes are there?
TP



None.
TP



Without points of connection between people, the majority of sins evaporate and lose meaning.
TP



Idealistic.
TP



You could call it an ideal society.
TP



To be alone. To throw away the masses.
TP



What abilities are needed for that?
TP



Or is a suitable mental construct what's needed?
TP



Humans have many and varied desires.
TP


They continue to exist even in different dimensions from such wants like 'I want to drink water.'
TP



What is desire?
TP



A desire for success.
TL
A desire for knowledge.
TL
A desire to create.
TL
A desire to conquer.
TP



Those are things with values decided either by others or by comparing oneself with others.
TP



Desire might just be a manifestation of wanting the consent of others.
TP



I want to have more wealth than other people.
TL
I want to have more knowledge than other people.
TL
I want to succeed more than other people.
TP



The prerequisite of others.
TP



The root of desire lies in attaining that which many people acknowledge as valuable.
TP



One of the clearer forms of that is currency.
TP



Even without an intended use for it, people will crave it.
TP



When humans live together with desire, their world is already being colored by the thoughts and values of others, and their characters thereby take shape.
TP



But if one were alone?
TP



How would his desires modify?
TP



No, the moment others disappeared, desires would lose that definition and become wants.
TP


A race with no rival doesn't constitute a competition, and thus high running speeds are no longer sought after.
TP



How many people are there in a world with only themselves, and who therefore are true intellectuals?
TP



Can they continue to create art without any viewers?
TP



Who are they to overcome?
TP



Yes.
TP



When alone, people change.
TP



They can't not change.
TP



The burdens of emotions that force them upward would no longer be minuses.
TP



If the world became one where sins weren't sins...
TP




I felt something like a revelation, telling me my ÅweyesÅx were for that purpose.
TP




I turned around.
TP



Taichi: "......how long do you intend to follow me?"
TP



My voice traveled far in this unpopulated space.
TP



Taichi: "Don't you have other things to do?"
TP



I waited.
TP



But there was no answer.
TP



Taichi: "Do something."
TP



I spat out those words and set off toward school.
TP



I can't preoccupy myself with every little thing.
TP



The fearsome presence continued to tail me.
TP



I'm thankful she's worrying about me.
TP



But, still.
TP



Taichi: "Because my hair is white, I'll never get sunstroke!!!"
TP



This might be something like getting irritated with one's mother.
TP



It had a certain freshness, but it was thoroughly annoying.
