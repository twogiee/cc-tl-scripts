Tomoki seemed dejected.

A dry laugh.

Taichi: "......I see."

I can no longer read ahead of him and tell him what happens next.

Tomoki: "So, what'd you come to school for?"
TP

Taichi: "For one like myself who possesses an Innocence License, I am autonomically drawing out my mental void by repeating such forces of habit as going to school, for the sole purpose of acting out the subtleties of a fragile teenage heart left behind in the world."

Tomoki: "There are still a lot of hot-blooded Koshieners out there."
IF $tlnote != 0 (TL note: This is a reference to fans of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, which plays in the Hanshin Koshien Stadium.)
TP

Taichi: "Ah, to the people calling themselves post-modern, those Koshieners would be seen as humans who aren't worth observing."

I flapped my hands.

Dark humor.

Sharp-tongued Tomoki likes that stuff.

//This line was so vague in Japanese I'm not actually sure if I was right in assuming he means the club. QC people will have to check if this is the day before the broadcast. Å`IX
//In any case, this isn't good for an adaptation. Once we decide what he's actually saying (I think he means Taichi's script should be prepared for tomorrow), we can adapt accordingly. - pondrthis

//This one's also vague, in that I can't tell where she isn't going a lot. Due to the piecemeal nature of these scripts, I can't tell if it's a valid statement to make about the broadcasting club with Taichi. Again, we'll have to debate this one later. Å`IX
