Hasekura Youko returned to her room.
TP


Youko: "......"
TP


Despite returning to her territory, Youko did not loosen up.
TP


She passed between the high-stacked towers of academic books, threw her book bag onto the bed and turned on the machines.
TP


In her six-tatami room was a set of three PCs with LCD monitors.
TP


They were arranged in an L-shape in the corner of the room, making it look cramped.
TP


Though all three were fully prepared to take pictures, she hardly ever looked at, much less used, the one machine dedicated to web surfing.
TP
//It's saying that the other two monitors are kind of useless? The comma makes this ambiguous -Neko
//It remains a veritable clusterfuck of commas, but I've done my best to clean it up (to my interpretation of the original meaning, at least). ~Bal
//Huh, later context makes it look like she _is_ web-browsing though. cf. line 173 or so. If so, this needs to be rephrased so that the machines "not looked at, much less used" are the other two machines. ~Bal


Because there was no one to interact with.
TP


The built-in ceiling-high bookshelves were stuffed with all kinds of specialist books.
TP


Not just in Japanese, but English and German, all of them in disarray.
TP


Since she could read them, there was no point to dividing them up by language.
TP


The shelves couldn't contain all of them, and several columns of books rose up from the floor.
TP


They must have been left untouched recently, since all of the columns had a thin layer of dust.
TP


Other than that, the tools and high-tech machinery stood out.
TP


There were many things in it, but originally the room was a simple one.
TP


A room to achieve an objective.
TP


With only one exception, nothing that could be called 'recreation' existed.
TP


A room filled with knowledge and means.
TP


It was that sort of private room.
TP


She sat in her chair and performed her daily tasks.
TP


Checking e-mail, reading the news.
TP


Political corruption.
TP


Juvenile crime.
TP


Malpractice cover-ups.
TP


The world doesn't change.
TP


There's a smooth increase in people committing suicide.
TP


From the pages about those suicides, Youko casually jumped to a forum, and there her eyes stopped.
TP


Because there was the word 'radio.'
TP


It was an occult site.
TP


'A ghost's voice from the radio' and 'the voice of God' and so on.
TP


It seems to have the power to stop listeners from killing themselves.
TP


She soon lost interest.
TP


In order to check the trends of her investments, she pulled up several foreign sites.
TP


This much was mechanical for her.
//Would "robotic" be better? Å`IX
//I'll go with "automatic" - Raide
//added 'for her' to make it clear that we're talking about Youko - Sheeta
TP


Normally she'd read books or mess with the machines to fulfill some need she had.
TP


But she had no plans today.
TP


For the past few days, she's been adjusting her online trade of a number of stocks that showed interesting movements.
TP


It's nice to have capital.
TP


It'll come in handy at some point.
TP


So will physical strength.
TP


Today too, she completed her training.
TP


These automatically completed tasks contributed to maintaining Youko.
TP


She once had an objective.
TP


To enhance herself and go out into the world.
//Since the line before this leads into it, the way it was written seemed fragmented. To is a harmless addition that prevents the awkward discrepancy. -Neko
TP


Back when she lived in the Hasekura mansion, she'd thought that was everything.
TP


Hard studies for that purpose.
TP


But the object of her ambition changed at some point.
TP


When she became half a person.
TP


In order to protect an immature companion, she started to sharpen her skills.
TP


And then she lost him.
TP


All indications of him had disappeared.
TP


What does Youko think about herself, she who continues to move around mechanically despite that?
TP


It can't be deduced from her scarce expressions.
TP


She turned off her computers.
TP


The room fell dark at once.
TP


Youko remained sitting in the chair.
TP


Her norm had ended.
TP


There's no longer anything to do.
TP


She looked at the clock. It was too early to sleep.
TP


Then,
TP


Her eyes stopped on the sole item of recreation in her room, leaning against the wall.
TP


A tiny, card-like radio.
//No clue what the English term is, but http://qprc.web.infoseek.co.jp/Stationery/Card/CardRadio.html has several pics of them if that helps. Å`IX
//No idea, but I'll adapt it accordingly until someone thinks of a name - Sheeta
TP


The switch had been left in the 'on' position.
TP


Nothing comes in on that wavelength.
TP


Sometimes, it would catch bits of broadcasts from far-off lands.
TP


That was it.

Youko: "............"
TP


Youko sighed, and gave herself up to inactive time.
TP


Just how much of it passed?
TP


Youko had been lightly sleeping, but awakened in an instant.
TP


She stared at the radio.
TP


She thought that she'd heard heavy breathing.
TP


Bringing with it a special nostalgic presence.

TP


The shock shot through Youko.
TP


She picked up the radio.
TP


She couldn't do anything else.
TP


She didn't even think of recording it.

The radio said it.

Youko: "............"
TP


Her mouth hung open, and her face looked as if her soul had been pulled out.
TP


Taichi's voice and breathing flowed from the radio.
TP


The broadcast ended in an instant.
TP


She could no longer hear his voice.
TP


Even so, Youko kept her ear up against the radio.
TP


She loved him.
TP


She adored him.
TP


He was the opposite gender.
TP


As Taichi said, Youko's feelings might have been impure.
TP


Youko-chan was too preferential when it came to automatically acting toward an objective.
TP


That form of love could be seen as ugly.
TP


But......her feelings were real.
TP


Taichi, and no one else, threw Youko's heart into disorder.
TP


She wasn't perfect herself.
TP


Youko knew that.
TP


Especially because of her childhood.
TP


She used a boy that looked upon her with admiration and warped his mind.
TP


On the day of the massacre, the weakness of being unable to kill a single person.
TP


She merely held her knife and stood still among the corpses.
TP


Other people she had no interest in. The first time she'd seen something destroyed.
//As is, these sentences are disconnected from each other and do not flow.  Quite probably intentional, but thought to note it. ~Bal
TP


An existence which merely shuddered at the ugliness of the world.
TP


A one-sided bond that wasn't even codependency.
TP


What should she have done?
TP


What could she have done to be able to walk with Taichi?
TP


Calm thought with no confusion.
TP


Which was now quivering like a helpless child.

At the same time, she broke down in tears.

It was a regret of extraordinary mass.

To Youko, an emotion she'd never felt in her life.

An extremely acute one.

She thought, from the bottom of her heart,
TP



If only I'd done better--

TP

That bothered him a little.

He dipped just his upper body into the room and gazed.

Until now they'd used it as a storehouse.
TP


A dusty, empty room.
TP


And yet just from a girl sleeping here for a few days, it smelled like this.
TP


Tomoki found that mysterious.
TP


Tomoki had been conscious of his sister's gender for a long time.
TP


Him not straying from the path......was because of their common temperament, and his cowardice being a match for his urges.
TP


Now that she's here, Tomoki's primitive emotional urges are being diluted.

TP


Tomoki: "......"
TP


They were once friends.
TP


Even in Gunjou, an assembly of weird people, they were especially eccentric.
TP


The boy made out to be the most seriously ill in Gunjou.
TP


He was in a perpetual noisy state, always making a commotion, and playing troublesome pranks.
TP


But Misato knew.
TP


When she peeked at him to try and surprise him, his face was unbelievably emotionless......that sort of boy.
TP


When he noticed Misato's existence, his eyes would half-heartedly focus and then slowly make a smile.
TP


Yes, make one.
TP


He consciously constructs smiles.
TP


In essence, he didn't understand what people were.
TP


It was quite a while after meeting him that she found out he was mimicking.
TP


Hasekura Youko warned her just once.
TP


I don't mind you being his friend. But, be prepared---
TP


Was he that frightening a boy?
TP


He certainly did have a strangely dangerous side.
TP


Misato is still worrying about that, even now.

TP


Misato thought.
TP


About falling in love.
TP


What sort of labor has Taichi done to do that?
TP


Tomoki thought.
TP


To Taichi, was he an existence that could be called a friend?
TP


Taichi: "When I was able to understand, everyone was gone."

Though the cold plastic had no traces of the boy.
TP


She could remember.

The touch of his skin. The scent of his hair. His breath on her ears.
//'Left' makes it feel fragmentary. This is also more parallel with the others. ~Bal

There was one thing she understood from that.
TP


Taichi's tumultuous attitude when making a commotion was his bitter, desperate cry for contact with a person.

In her vast room, Touko was sprawled out on her desk.
TP


After returning home to her peaceful days, Touko sunk.
TP


Alone again.
TP


No change from before she got close to Taichi.
TP


She originally had an inclination toward isolation.
TP


On the other hand, after becoming close to him, she became boundlessly dependent.
TP


She'd sell her pride, regardless of the means, if she could draw closer to him.
TP


She had a fragile side.
TP


Thus it was appropriate that Touko was in a girls' school.
TP


But, some years ago, she had a confrontation with her friends and classmates.
TP


Men and women don't ask for dependence.
TP


What Touko's essence desired was someone subordinate to her.
TP


Because of the wounds she inflicted, Touko was made to take the highly infamous state exam.
TP


And then......was sent to Gunjou.
TP


With just that truth, all her friends were wiped away.
TP


No contact came at all.
That's what first made Touko obstinate.
TP


When Touko moved to that mansion, for some reason, her parents' love didn't heal her.
TP


She must have needed someone else.
TP


Being loved by one's parents was too obvious.
TP


Whether it was Touko, or someone else entirely.
TP


Touko wanted some other human to see her own value.
TP


Her attitude was for that meeting.
TP


Because she craved it half to death, when she was fulfilled she was blown up and away.
TP


Throwing away herself and her pride.
TP


......not knowing that those were the most precious things.
TP


Someone knocked on the door and spoke to her.
TP


A maid had brought Touko's dinner.

Taichi: "Because if you don't stand on your own, your heart's territory won't expand."

TP

TP


The rumored radio program was here.
TP


Miki attached earphones and passed one end to Kiri.

Kiri: "This is......?"

Miki: "Yes, it's Sempai."
TP


The mysterious radio broadcast.
TP


People had started talking about it on the internet, and it was rushing around Japan while creating various town legends.
TP


Taichi: "I'd like to talk about the past today."
TP


Kurosu Taichi.
TP


Taichi: "I might have talked about it a long time ago, though I don't remember......"
TP


There's no doubt.
TP


He disappeared, leaving only strange memories in the Broadcasting Club members' hearts.
TP


Taichi: "But I'm sure I've told someone about this before."
TP


He's not missing or disappeared.
TP


Taichi: "A long time ago, I committed a sin---"
TP


By himself, with no one knowing the truth.
TP


A single boy who was like an illusion.
TP


WVP 0 vfCCX0001kri006
Kiri: "He's alive......and......he's still around somewhere? But how?"
TP


WVP 0 vfCCX0001mki007
Miki: "He's......broadcasting."
TP


A ghost broadcast.
TP


This was actually the first time they'd heard one.
TP


Taichi: "I made a friend of mine die......"
TP


Taichi told a story.
TP


It was about a friend of his.
TP


A boy that Taichi led to his death.

Kiri: "......"

Miki: "......"
TP


Neither of them moved a muscle until the broadcast ended.
TP


At long last static wiped out the boy's voice.
TP


They both sighed, as if released from a curse.

TP

TP

Miki: "I think...Sempai wished for it. To be alone."
TP


WVP 0 vfCCX0001kri012
Kiri: "That's why I just said-! That's why......"
TP


WVP 0 vfCCX0001mki013
Miki: "Only his voice reaches us......somehow...that's just like Sempai, right?"
TP


The other world, and this world.
TP


Whatever Taichi did, these two came back to this one.
TP


And he's conducting club activities by himself.
TP


WVP 0 vfCCX0001kri013
Kiri: "......yes."
TP

Miki: "It's lonely."
TP


WVP 0 vfCCX0001kri014
Kiri: "Yes. And...sad."
TP

Miki: "I want to see him."
TP


WVP 0 vfCCX0001kri015
Kiri: "So do I......"
TP


The day of parting for two close friends.
TP


They both ended up confronting a parting of the past.

Taichi: "And so, see you next week---"
TP


The broadcast wrapped up with those words.
TP

Sakuraba: "......hoo."
TP


A path between mountains.
TP


Sakuraba had stopped his bike to take a rest, and was smiling softly.
TP


WVP 0 vmCCX0001sku001
Sakuraba: "It's been a long time, friend."
TP


There was no way his words would be heard.
TP


And yet Sakuraba voiced them.
TP


He does what he wants to do as long as it doesn't cause problems, and he hangs out with whoever he likes.
TP


He'd thought Taichi was gone.
TP


But today, he heard his voice.
TP


'So he's still alive somewhere,' Sakuraba thought.
TP


That was enough to fill his heart and make him happy.

Taichi: "......nn?"
TP


I got up.
TP


I felt a strange presence, but...
TP


Taichi: "I thought......I heard......everyone......"
TP


There was no presence on the roof.
TP


All was silent.
TP


Am I hearing voices?
TP


It was more like I felt them than heard them.
TP


Taichi: "Nnn???"
TP


I've overslept.
TP


Taichi: "Whatever."

I went back to sleep.
