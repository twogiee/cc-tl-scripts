My days in the mansion had been immersed in dark impurity.

My form reflected in the window was that of a girl.

Obviously.
TP


Because I was cross-dressing.

I had a roommate.
TP


Hasekura Youko.
TP


It was her.

And during the night events, we were favored.
TP


It was a good place for child abuse.
TP


But that wasn't it.
TP


The excuse was that Youko-chan and I were under their protection.
TP


Every night, we were hurt by the speartip of the animal passions people possessed.
TP


Every day, every day.
TP


There were people being hurt, and people hurting them.
TP


And then we saw the end of someone being hurt.
TP


A husband and wife torn apart.
TP


We could only endure it.

We only expected to live through it.

We lived, with our entire hearts and bodies covered in wounds.

With just that vow, we had enough strength to live.

If only that man hadn't come---

We devised a plan.

The battle strength of two children.
TP


And knowledge of the land.
TP


The important part was to get them all in one fell swoop.
TP


They numbered too many for us to defeat individually.
TP


We needed an equation to make the impossible possible.
TP


We made time, prepared tools, trained, observed, altered, investigated, deferred, purchased, revised, searched, decided, withdrew and kissed.
TP


We were going to grant them ruin, equal to the cost of all the dignity they'd stolen.

The campout I'd forcefully arranged ended in failure, and everyone was walking with frigid feelings.

Stacks of notebooks reaching up to the ceiling.

University notebooks had been shoved in here until there was no more room.

Even though I have no memory of writing them...

I followed my handwriting.

One notebook......two notebooks......
TP


Confusion swelled up as I continued reading.
TP


Seven notebooks......eight notebooks......
TP


My doubt surpassed a certain point and within moments formed an organic combination with my brain.
TP


Taichi: "......we're......repeating?"
TP


And, while I was loving someone, bringing them back and reconciling with them......I desired a blessed conclusion of a fixed probability with everyone in unity.
TP


The world will end after one week.
TP


Just that little time.
TP


Since I know we're repeating, and being reset---

Friendship, bonds, unity.

The result......is a cruel thing.

Touko: "......"
TP


With no words, her line of sight moved back outside.

TP


I had no words for her.
TP


Taichi: "You're alive......"
TP


I covered my eyes.
TP


The girl who, in my memories......died yesterday.
TP


Taichi: "Aaah!......"
TP


I fell to my knees and left my whole body to the numbness coming from my emotions.
TP


Touko faced me as if looking at something queer.
TP


Taichi: "See you later."
TP


I waved to her with a queerly forced smile, and left the classroom.

Taichi: "......it's Monday."

I've returned as myself.

I peeked into the right place, but the sense of conjunction had disappeared.
TP


Taichi: "Nn......it's gone?"
TP


That can't be.
TP


I hurriedly searched the surroundings.
TP


Taichi: "......that's it."
TP


I was filled with understanding.
TP


Taichi: "It can only connect at a specific time."
TP


Regardless of the logic, I had to assume that.
TP


In any event, I'll be able to tell on the weekend.
TP


If I can't figure it out, I can just spend another week investigating it.
TP


I took the notebooks out of the hokora.
TP


I'll investigate.
TP


What's going on in this world.
TP


I'll study it.
TP


If there is no flawless happiness, that's just fine.
TP


Having everyone get along was no more than my wish.
TP


When contacting any individual person, there were ways to attain an optimal result.
TP


That will be how I make my living.
TP


Memories live on in my heart.
TP


I can explain it in a single sentence.
TP


I wished.
TP


For a paradise where no one had to be hurt.
TP


Mutsumi-san, I'm going to try and obtain that.
