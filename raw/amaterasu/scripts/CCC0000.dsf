My oldest memory.
//CP_S cca0001
TP


Within far-off mists where even the date was vague.
TP


A luxurious private room embodying the dignity of nobles.
TP


Therein was a canopied bed and a European chair. 
TP


But I preferred to sit on the floor.
TP


Especially on these days.
TP


I could see the curtain of a black starry night through my window.
TP


My eyes were drawn to the scattered twinkles cut off by the window frame.
TP


I saw my reflection in the glass separating the outside world from the room's interior.
TP


A privileged young noblewoman---
TP


A graceful girl covered in a Western dress.

Girl: "......Taichi."

Silver hair......with a transparent, ambiguous outline.
TP

It hung down long, covering my hips. Its tips rippled loosely.
TP


Her face was small. Just like a doll's.
TP


『Those features aren't of this world.』
TP



Who was it that said that?
TP

Was it the missus? Or one of her older sisters?

Her sweet voice was charming to my ears.

The memories from before my tenth year are muddled in places, as if I was dreaming.
//No one change this to "ten years old." 〜IX
//Having 'before' and 'after' in the same sentence so close together was a bit confusing. - Sheeta
TP


『Come over here now, let's play.』
TP


I never disobeyed.
TP


A girl's clothes, a girl's mannerisms, a girl's speech.
TP


When those who worked at the mansion (or their refined owners) played with dolls, I couldn't tell if it was high-brow or childish, but despite being boring, it wasn't unpleasant.
TP


I thought that was close to the reason,
TP


Why the image of me reflected in the window is that of a girl.
TP


Yes, there is just one thing I remember clearly.
TP


Within the crowd of tenderly aged girls, there was one who didn't smile.
TP


She was the only one who didn't play with me.
TP


The girl's appearance 『I』 had for fulfilling the role of her tea-drinking partner was always adorned without reserve.
//"The girl's appearance 'I' had..."? I don't get it. Explain this part to me in the forums later.-Spin
TP


She, who strolled alone in the huge garden, always sent her gaze my way in a scornful manner.
TP


With clear, black eyes like obsidian.
TP


I trembled.
TP


When her eyes faced me, my heart was always in a panic.
//'eyes faced' brings up weird and surreal images for me - Sheeta
TP


Delight? Or shame?
TP


Perhaps both.
TP


For me, who had little experience of being upset by something, emotions that raged out of control were a rare thing.
TP


Even so, in public I calmly presented my smile before the ladies.
TP


I needed to bear my duty in mind.
TP


My duty......to fulfill the role of a doll.
TP


In order to live.
TP


During that doll period, I never conversed with her.
TP


Not even once.
TP


The image of that girl standing aloof in an estranged place left a strong impression on me.
TP


I found out later.
TP


She was also a doll bought up with money.
//Sounded better this way.-Spin
TP


The air swirled and chilled.
TP


The open air of a cold hallway.
TP


I turned around to see the side of a door that had opened without a sound.
TP



She had been standing there.
TP


Oh august you---
//Adapt as you will, but I am convinced "august" is the adjective I want to use here. 〜IX
TP


But, what was this?
TP


The girl standing before me had been lightly tarnished.
TP


No.
TP


She'd been defiled. By nefarious means.
TP


Torn clothing. Abrasions running across her white skin.
TP


A line of blackish blood at the corner of her lips.
TP



*stagger*
TP


My field of vision rippled.
TP


The doll period was humorous, but fortunate.
TP


She and I hadn't lived together.
TP


My memory is in disorder.
TP


Yes......in other words......her being here means......
TP


The boisterous missus and noblewomen. Rather young servants.
TP


Sweet days, like sugar snacks, passed through my memory in fast forward.

The period when we were both assigned to just one room.
TP


The stage fell from heaven to hell.
TP


At some point I realized the fixtures around us had gone, now only gray walls remained.
TP


The bedstead was crude.
TP


The sheets were a bit dirty.
TP


The lighting was a bare bulb.
TP


The floor was finely split wood.
TP


The beautiful silk curtains fell to the rank of dustcloth.
TP


Painful, heavy, contemptible, a premature bottleneck on life.
//I don't have any better ideas here. 〜IX

Those circumstances tied together two people who had never even heard the other speak.

My name.

The missus and others took out one character from my manly name, replacing it with one that was girlishness itself, then called me by that new name.

Ichihime.

It was elegant.

But she never called me that.

She didn't even react to my question, closing the distance between us instead.

And, as if it were perfectly natural, she pushed me down onto the bedstead.

Silence floated in the space between us.

I felt like my breath would stop at any moment.

A sweet smell.
TP


It was neither perfume nor soap.

It was the smell of the girl's own body.

Beneath the beastly smell that made me ready to vomit, it stood up to deny everything.

Her lips, like soft flower petals, gently pushed out words.

Since we didn't have power, we had to protect ourselves with intellect.

Because legally, 『they』 were our guardians.

But what if those guardians were our assailants?
We couldn't disobey.

Sweet slime flowed into my oral cavity.

Her bare skin was the color of moonlight, denying evidence of guilt.

Her noble fragility.

Her four mysterious limbs were soaked in the crooked beams of silver light, like a living sculpture.

All of which had been insulted by innumerable fine wounds.

After her lips passed, there remained a soft trail of clear slime.

Her head was going down.

Not long after, she slipped into my skirt.

Her fingers rolled my underwear down, and lowered it to my ankles.

I had no words. I covered my eyes with one arm.

Finally the satisfaction washing over my lower body was cut off.

It had been a long time since bodily sensations had removed my biological control.

But there was just one place, an organ now so sensitive it ached.
TP

Even I could tell that its pulsation was vivid.

This is different from the sensations given to me coercively by the adults.

Inside my skirt, where I couldn't see, what kind of caressing could give me that hallucination?

My base was tied up, and I lost both semen and its way out.

The heat lurked and whirled in my crotch.

The spiraling, twisting tongue then made its way to my tip.

No. It's not possible.

But my body shook from a satisfaction that couldn't be anything else.

I was devoured.

The mouth of a girl who was always the object of yearning for disgusting organs.

My spine wouldn't stop shaking.
TP

Without any doubt, it was from neither coldness or fear, but rather a fit of enjoyment.
TP

I made myself accept this by saying that she'd become a demon.
TP

A female, semen-sucking demon.
TP

She was punishing me for not refusing to wear girl's clothing.
TP

That's why, underneath my undergarments, any unreasonable thing could happen.
TP

The tip of her tongue might split, and stretch along my shaft like a vine.
//Filled in missing word lol - Sheeta

TP

Taichi: "No!......no, don't......"
TP

I was way past my limit.
TP

And yet, I couldn't mark the end of it.
TP

Perhaps because my base was tied up, that which irresistable urges were pushing forth simply wouldn't come and bring about a physical end to this.

At the same time, the thing she'd been chewing on was softly untied.

For a moment, I felt like I was about to climax.
TP

The sense of releasing a beast.
TP

But,
TP

Before that could happen, her hands moved.
TP

Between the two filthy organs, her fingers applied pressure.
TP

When she pushed down on that flat place, the fluid at my base rooted in place for some reason.
TP

The fluid beast was easily exorcised and quieted.
TP

She easily tamed a monster I couldn't do anything about.

My pleasure,

My pain,

Their natural owner was none other than her.

It went from contact not unlike pecking to an adherence of membranes.

She bent her head and pushed her body weight onto me, causing deeper adherence.

She twisted around the base of my tongue immediately, and I was pulled into her mouth.
TP

The two winding tongues embraced and rubbed against each other.

Both our salivae formed a blob that spilled out of our mouths.

We sweetly bit each other's lips, fighting for our turns.

My deeply thrust tongue disappeared between her lips.
