Kiri: "........................"
TP

Kiri wasn't able to react.
TP

Her hand had stopped shaking.
TP

She'd calmed down......no, that wasn't it.
TP

She was looking at me with a shocked expression.
TP

She didn't notice the arrowhead was no longer pointing at me.

Taichi: "You might have figured this out already, but S was also the initial for Shinkawa."

Kiri: "......wh-what are you saying......?"

Half-smiling.

She seems unable to even control her emotions.

Taichi: "Even though he was also a child, he knew those things. I'd thought he could never have a decent life."

TP

Taichi: "That is true, and Yutaka did do such things."
TP

Taichi: "He was the most enthusiastic."
TP

She smiled.
TP

Taichi: "Well, he was a kid, so it must have been painful to rape adult women. That part of a woman would be a big shock to---"

She felt like a detective now.

TP

Taichi: "......meeting him was a coincidence."
TP

Taichi: "Since I was made to cross-dress......it looks like he didn't know either."
TP

But Yutaka lived through it.
TP

Taichi: "Well, a lot happened and I was released......and for complicated reasons I came here."
TP

Our conversation started to flow in the reverse direction.

Her swelling of emotions dashed waves against me, drenching me and turning me backwards.

Kiri.

You're the one who came to attack me.

Now, once again, I threw the same question at her.
TP

Taichi: "Hey, Kiri......was Yutaka happy?"

An ordinary question.

But,

Kiri didn't answer. She looked downward.
TP

She pointed her weapon downward too.
TP

Her animosity and murderous intent had withered. A dried flower.
TP

Her slender body filled with the toxin known as doubt.
TP

Taichi: "That's right, isn't it? If we could cleanly forget stuff that happened a long time ago, all our hearts would be squeaky clean. We could become as happy as we wanted!"
TP

TP

Taichi: "......I had just one question."

Taichi: "And I asked him."
TP


Taichi: "'Hey, I have a question for you......why won't you go die already?'"

Kiri broke and fell.

She sat down immobile.
TP

A pitiful smile was carved on my face.
TP

Taichi: "In any event, there's only one truth."
TP

Just one last push will break her.

Even though I knew that, I...

Whispered in her ear.

To run her through with the true blade.

Taichi: "Your nii-san was a horrible, filthy rapist."

I knew a thread had been cut inside Kiri.

It definitely won't be tied back together.
