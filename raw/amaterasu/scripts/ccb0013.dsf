Mutsumi-oba-san made being beautiful her career. She was also a great cook.

Although she's so busy that she rarely comes home.

I lowered my head.

Then I took her up on that offer, washing down a bulky sandwich with vegetable juice.

There's no time to waste.

I covered the rest in plastic wrap and stuck it in my pocket.

This pretty girl named Yuusa-chan lives nearby.

Upper Misaka is a good town.

Curry bread was shaking in Yuusa-chan's hands. She's too cute for words.

We started walking together.

Behind us I heard a husky voice say, ÅwHabe phun at skool!!Åx

It was Yuusa-chan's mom.

She's a bit on the heavy side.

But, since she seems to enjoy her life every single day, it's probably fine.

A pretty girl born to an ordinary family.

Her only fault was being too unfamiliar with how the world works.

That last ÅwahÅx was certainly not an innocent amorous breath brought up by a rubbing of her most sensitive parts.

A bridge had been built between me and Yuusa-chan.

The other end was Yuusa-chan's nose.

A bridge of mucus.

That high viscosity fluid,

into a suspension bridge.
//PCP just barely, and only because there aren't TPs between these three lines like there were in the first week.
TP

This is my reasoning:
TP

At the moment of the sneeze, a mucus bullet fired faster than the Shinkansen (that's true) hit my uniform.
TP



The girl who formed a bullet from that strongly adherent fluid tried to suck it back into her nostrils, and instead of snapping as one would expect, the junction was lucky enough to hold together and form a bridge.
