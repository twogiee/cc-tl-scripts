I found her belongings. She'd come.
TP

Did she move somewhere else?
TP

Taichi: "......"
TP

I took a deep breath.
TP

I closed my eyes, and squeezed my eyeballs with my eyelids.
TP

In the depths of my lenses, the image of a switch being flipped arose.
TP

That's not what happened.
TP

I'm just intentionally accelerating what my eyes would slowly do automatically when the luminosity radically changes.
TP

I opened them.
TP

The night had become brighter.
TP

The subtle movements of the plants were clearly shown in my field of vision.
TP

A cat's eyes---
TP

My senses had become sharper.
TP

Taichi: "I don't like this......not at all."

I even had the sense that I was something entirely different.

Kiri: "......!"
TP

Seeing an opening, Kiri moved.
TP

But Youko-chan hadn't averted her gaze.
TP

She flicked her wrist, rotating the belt suspended from her hand.
TP

One revolution.
TP

By releasing one of the two ends in her grip, the stone inside, pushed on by centrifugal force was released.
//I know there's no such thing as centrifugal force. Blame Taichi. 〜IX
//That's a joke right? Centrifugal force is real...-Spin
//Well, that depends.  If you work out the laws of motion in a non-inertial, rotating reference frame a centrigual force term will appear as a 'fictitious force' (along with, if memory serves the Coriolis force term), but for the most part when people refer to as 'centrifugal force' they actually mean 'centripetal force'. ~Bal

With timing like that, nothing could be done.

The stone hit Kiri hard on the calf.

Kiri: "Gu!!"
TP

She stooped over.
TP

She held her leg and gritted her teeth. There should be a spasm of violent pain running through her.
TP

My spine chilled.
TP

That's a sling.
TP

A weapon used by ancient shepherds to guard their sheep.
TP

Against Kiri's crossbow, it was quite a primitive weapon.
TP

No, it's not really a weapon.
TP

It's not, but......that power is tremendous.
TP

She's spinning a strap around with a stone in it and letting go.
TP

That's it.
TP

That propulsion, using neither compressed air nor gunpowder nor gas, comes only from the length of the strap and the number of rotations.
TP

A bullet under the consideration of atmospheric friction.
TP

A gun barrel in the polar regions of minute numbers.
TP

Reliability for being used continuously under horrible conditions.
TP

Hard studies continued for the sake of killing people.
TP

Of course, it can't compare to small arms.
TP

But hers......it was different.
TP

Guided by blessed genes since her birth, despite looking like nothing more than a tender girl, she has muscles that can outperform an adult male's.
//This seems to imply that her muscles look like a tender girl. "Despite X, Y outperforms Z" means X applies to Y (in this case X being 'looking like a tender girl' and Y being 'her muscles'). Wording needs to be changed. -VDZ
//And no, adding 'and' before the sentence does not solve anything. The subject of sentence #1 and #2 are still the same subject as in sentence #3 (her muscles). -VDZ
//I completely disagree.  Perhaps if the entire sentence was 'despite x, y [verb] z', but that completely ignores the first clause, leading to it obviously being just a case of a nested parenthetical.  The first and last bits refer to her muscles alone, while the middle (the parenthetical) refers to her general appearance instead, as a contrast.  Also, the addition of 'and' disturbs this flow, so it's been removed. ~Bal
//Solved. 〜IX
TP

It's not simply arm strength.
TP

Agility, tension, mobility.
TP

From that standpoint, being a woman was hardly a handicap at all.
TP

Hasekura Youko always moves quickly and silently.
TP

She had a good command of the arm and leg extensions for a challenging weapon like the sling.
TP

There was no arrow set in the crossbow Kiri held.
TP

......she must have counterattacked and missed.
TP

This should also be a frightening weapon.
TP

But now, it can't even be a makeshift shield for Kiri.
TP

Without being given the time to set a new arrow, she was being driven away by the stones.
TP

No,
TP

She did well to live this long.
TP

Though she probably wasn't on her guard during Youko-chan's first attack, she managed to protect herself.
TP

Youko: "............"
TP

She put a second stone in the belt.
TP

With the tension in her wrist, she made a disk of afterimages. In an instant.

She increased the number of revolutions.
TP

The moving air made a sharp sound.
TP

The destructive power swelling up before my eyes made Kiri cower in fear.
TP

The finality of death.
TP

That wasn't something Kiri could believe.
TP

That rotational force had already imparted enough motive energy to the stone.
TP

With her true skill, she could release after one rotation.
TP

Her strength had fallen somewhat.
TP

Thanks to that, Kiri's leg hadn't received a serious injury.
TP

But if she hits her in the head, she'll eventually die.
TP

Is she trying to bring her down for good?
TP

She sharply maintained the high number of revolutions.

Aaah, this girl can't even pick up one CRT monitor.

She's really weak.

Although the kinds in the club room are pretty big.

When I touched her shoulder, she was excessively delicate in her shock.

Like a thin plate, as if she could break at any time.

If the Broadcasting Club arm-wrestled, she'd be in last place.
