At night, while I was writing my diary,
TP

Taichi: "Nn?"

I heard a noise outside.
TP


I blew out the candle,
TP

Moved to the window,
TP

And looked outside.
TP

Someone was walking down the street in front of my house.
TP

......Kiri.
TP

She was carrying something.
TP

Maybe I was just starving for things to write in my diary.
TP

My curiosity raised its head.
TP

I went downstairs.

From far away, I 『could see』 Kiri's back.
//Not sure why 'could see' is in the brackets here. It might make sense in Japanese, but it seems really random in English - Sheeta
TP

I followed her.
TP

We left the town, and at long last, Kiri set down what she'd been carrying.
TP

I killed my presence to prevent her finding me, and approached.

A crossbow---
TP

It definitely wasn't a toy.
TP

Out of everything you could get in this country, it was a weapon of unparalleled strength.
TP

Though it can't fire repeatedly.
TP

It excels in silence, and abounds in destructive power.
TP

Kiri pulled the trigger.
TP

An arrow pierced a rotted tree.
TP

The sound of air moving was left in my ears.
TP

Kiri readied a new arrow.
TP

She finished loading it with the cocking device.
TP

Awkward.
TP

But, I knew.
TP

This is training.
TP

To fight.
TP

But, with who?
TP

With......who......?
TP

Icicles entered my back.
TP

Taichi: "......!"
TP

WVP 0 vfCCC3005you000
Youko: "Shh."
TP

Just as I started to jump up, my shoulder was pushed down with exquisite timing.
TP

Telling me to sit.
TP

The strength left my knees.

Youko: "Stay quiet."
TP

I took one deep breath, regaining my calmness.
TP

I spoke in a low voice.
TP

Taichi: "Why are you here?"
TP

Youko: "Same as Taichi."
TP

So she'd noticed Kiri's behavior.
TP

WVP 0 vfCCC3005you003
Youko: "She seems to be doing this every day."
TP

Taichi: "......where did she get that thing?"
TP

WVP 0 vfCCC3005you004
Youko: "Mania."
TP

Taichi: "Yeah, that seems right......"
TP

If you have money, you can purchase anything with comparative ease.
TP

Kiri continued her training for a while.
TP

WVP 0 vfCCC3005you005
Youko: "......do you want me to take it?"
TP

Sudden words.
TP

The space between the periodic whistling sounds sucked me into silence.
TP

Simply remaining in my ears forever.
TP

Accompanied by something which made me shudder.

Youko: "......I understand."
TP

I lowered my shoulders indifferently.
TP

Taichi: "Youko-chan, even you're human......the same. Human."

TP

She smiled.

Youko: "Yes, fiances."
TP

Even though her smiles sometimes held a maiden's innocence.
TP

Why---
TP

Before that sorrow painted over my heart, Kiri moved.
TP

She collected all the arrows she'd shot.
TP

And then shot them again.
TP

Kiri completed three rounds of this training.

Youko: "With her skill, as long as she can't aim at point blank range, I think I'll be fine."
TP

Taichi: "I don't want it to come down to that......"
TP

I unexpectedly remembered the hokora.
TP

Taichi: "Hey, Youko-chan, do you know about the hokora?"
TP

WVP 0 vfCCC3005you018
Youko: "......I know."
TP

Taichi: "That this world is......"

She cut off my words as if with a slap.

TP

Taichi: "............"
TP

I kept silent.
TP

If she says it, then it's so.
TP

Hasekura Youko is always accurate.
TP

Kiri went away.
TP

There was no longer a need to pursue her.
TP

We walked across the plain and examined the targeted tree.
