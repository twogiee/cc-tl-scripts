It was taking shape.

A lot of tuning was needed, for directionality and wavelength and so on.

Apparently you need just the right environment to send out EM waves.
TP


It's a strictly local radio broadcast called Community FM.
//Proper name, proper noun. ~Bal
TP


That's not a low enough goal for a school club to aim for.
TP


But,
TP


The favorable location, the history of Gunjou Institute, and the goodwill of interested local people.
TP


Those things tied together into this.
TP


The preparations still continued, but due to a certain incident with loose ends, it had become rather indefinite.
TP


The antenna was delivered, but then left alone for a year.
TP


Those were the circumstances.
TP


Most likely, the items requested for Gunjou FM were filled with hopes and dreams for healthy young boys and girls.
TP


Sorry, but Gunjou is no such thing.
//Major confusion here. Gunjou itself at no point of time in the last two lines was described. The way I read this is: Gunjou has no such things, or: Gunjou isn't something for that. Mild flaw in subject -Neko

You could say the result was all right.

Misato-sempai plans to send an SOS.
TP


She said so on Sunday night.
TP


After we split up and confirmed that humanity had disappeared.
TP


Since the antenna has some altitude, we'll attempt to complete it so we can send a dispatch...... it was certainly lacking in a sense of realism.

There wasn't much of a rubbing sensation, so there was no direct stimulus, but...

TP


Of course I didn't change my mind.
