I woke up.
TP

I'd been sleeping on my desk.
TP

I'd been dreaming.
TP

A dream that should have been nostalgic.
TP

But it put me in a melancholic mood.
TP

In the end, people are living for their own sake.
TP

Yielding many contacts with other people, within various desires.
TP

To cool off my sweaty body, I headed for the roof.
