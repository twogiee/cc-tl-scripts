She was surrounded by high walls.

Kurosu Taichi's harassment of Touko continued.

That wasn't because of malice.

It was an experiment.

How far could a human like me go in the normal world by acting sociable?

How much could I deceive them?

Based on the results, I might decide how I'll live.
TP


Could I blend in?

By imitating the pity form called a 'bond?'

Is life possible?

To do that, one needs a certain degree of power to control people's wills.

Because I'm an oddity.

I can't not be feared.

My foulness can't not be of concern.

The ugliness at my foundation directly connected to the image of a witch.

The cause......probably some story I heard when I was a kid.

From what I read in books, witch hunting has historically been quite severe, and that might be due to the idea that 『Witches really are evil people.』
